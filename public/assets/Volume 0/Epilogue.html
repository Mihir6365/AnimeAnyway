    <p class="c7"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Today is March 11. The recorder is Suzukake Tanji.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Putting his phone&rsquo;s camera in recording mode, Suzukake placed it on the
            desk.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, he turned the lens towards himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;For a long time, I&rsquo;ve been in charge of education in this White
            Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On this day, Suzukake decided to quietly record his research impressions on his
            phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;However, from today, White Room will be frozen for a while. I don&rsquo;t know
            anything about politics, but it looks like a politician called Naoe started working towards stopping
            Ayanokoji-sensei&rsquo;s return. He&rsquo;s really making trouble for us. But, I decided to think with the
            future in mind. A long vacation after all this, that&rsquo;s not so bad either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if to take a breather, Suzukake turned off the computer&rsquo;s monitor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Humans really are interesting. As with all children, there are times they can
            learn things that they haven&rsquo;t been taught. Just like how they can breathe without being taught how
            to, the children kept in a closed environment, while only slightly, are seeking communication. After
            noticing this with the education from the first to the fourth period students, after the 5th period
            students, I decided to introduce a curriculum that encourages communication. Of course, this also caused
            some inefficiency. The rate of increase of their abilities decreased with the birth of emotions. Despite
            that, the 5th period students who have a more difficult curriculum are more capable than even the 3rd period
            students.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Punishment, and emotions should remain as extras.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake still hasn&rsquo;t changed his way of thinking on that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Regarding the curriculum of 10 levels, the 4th level of difficulty is applied
            to the 5th period students, and the 5th level of difficulty is applied to the 6th period students. This is
            probably the limit. With the 6th level of education we applied to the 7th period students, all of them have
            already dropped out. We have modified the curriculum since the 8th period and are continuing to use the 4th
            and 5th levels in combination, mixing them well. In time, these children will become ideal adults. They will
            be able to integrate into the world as one of its common people.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, Suzukake was silent for a moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I guess this kind of thing is easy to figure out when you look at the files.
            The reason I wanted to leave a recording today is to remember the passion that kept us running. Many
            children have already learned in, and dropped out of White Room, but the presence of that child... Kiyotaka
            Ayanokoji, is still significant. His extraordinary ability to learn, adapt, and apply himself. His talent
            continues to amaze me every day, and his valuation never ceases to grow. The researchers in White Room
            believe that they can train him in the same way as those children, but in my opinion, that child is the
            exception. He is even more unique in this distorted environment. A true mutation.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The self-made beta curriculum. A product of education that boasts the highest level
            of difficulty.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if I should say product. Rather, we can&rsquo;t
            replicate him. However, even that Kiyotaka wasn&rsquo;t flawless from the beginning. His studies,karate or
            boxing, his achievements were normal and did not stand out at first. The greatness came after that. He is
            able to quickly absorb everything into his abilities. After he learned the basics, he also learned the
            technique and the extraordinary ability to adapt and deal with anything he touches.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if I close my eyes, Kiyotaka&rsquo;s figure which is burned into the back of my
            eyelids does not disappear.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The remaining children in the 8th year have decreased to 5. Considering that
            there were 74 at the start, the drop out rate is over 93%. The average dropout rate from the 1st period to
            the 3rd period is 27%, and 30% after the 5th period. I can surmise that the beta curriculum was reckless,
            after all. At this time, I was afraid that everyone in the 9th year would drop out. No&hellip; Rather, I
            wished that they would. If by any chance, a child who was able to succeed through a curriculum that humans
            shouldn&rsquo;t be capable of was to remain&hellip; that is already a monster that I cannot consider as a
            human being. It shouldn&rsquo;t exist. As if supporting this theory, heading towards spring, only one child
            was left in the end. However, the problem is what happens after. That person shows no signs of dropping out
            even after 10, 11, or 12 years have passed. Let alone drop out, he became able to surpass us researchers and
            instructors. Adults with superficial knowledge left White Room scratching their heads after only a few days.
            White Room&rsquo;s objective in the first place is to continue the education until adulthood. However, 6
            more years&hellip; It&rsquo;s impossible. In the near future, that child will surpass our knowledge. This
            isn&rsquo;t just a hunch, I&rsquo;m convinced. At the same time, I can no longer tell. Whether this presence
            was born because of my curriculum, or whether he is a genetic mutation. How was he able to survive without
            dropping out? I can&rsquo;t prove the reason for that. I&rsquo;m almost going crazy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then - How should we perceive the existence of White Room and Kiyoata in the
            future?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The one who will decide in the end is Ayanokoji Atsuomi, this facility&rsquo;s
            representative, but the opinions between the researchers are largely divided.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We still haven&rsquo;t proven if it is possible to create artificial geniuses
            or not, but I can say that we have proven that White Room can create superior human beings. However, every
            child must have a cap that will be their upper limit.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake looked at the empty cup that had green tea in it a few minutes ago, opened a
            new bottle of mineral water, and took only the cup and the bottle cap.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This represents the talent of an educator. This small cap is in other words
            the limit of a normal educator&rsquo;s talent. It&rsquo;ll be easy to understand if you consider this large
            cup compared to this cap is the talent of the educators in White Room. The children receiving their
            education increase their own limits in accordance with the educators&rsquo; talent. Considering the
            cap&rsquo;s size as the limit for an average human, if they receive an education here their talent can reach
            the size of this cup.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He poured the new mineral water into the cup.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Once you reach the upper limit, there is fundamentally no more room for
            growth. The water spills out, and you become unable to absorb anything new. &hellip;No, maybe that
            isn&rsquo;t the correct way to represent it. As you absorb new knowledge, your old talents are slowly lost.
            Without you even noticing it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Looking at the water spilling out onto the desk, Suzukake sighed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There are a variety of problems ahead. First, there are only a limited number
            of people with the talent that is the size of this cup. Second, that even if they have the talent, they do
            not necessarily have the ability to teach others. Thirdly, that it is not always possible to have this
            amount of talent. The upper limit is the size of this cup, but some individuals are often one or two sizes
            smaller than that. Of course, there are also cases of children who develop to be one or two times larger
            than this upper limit, but the ratio of these children is smaller than the former. The most important part
            is that geniuses in this world are not limited to the size of this cup. They have talent beyond the size of
            this mineral bottle, or even more. There is no one who has that much talent, and also the skill to educate
            others. And even if there was, the children would probably never grow up to be bigger than the
            cup.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This reality is also clear from the research date up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A warm education provided to the children, or the other way around, a strict
            education. No matter which way you go, I think there is a limit to the aptitude a child has.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The goal of the White Room project is to create geniuses from ordinary people, and
            raise up human resources that can fight the world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;It is possible to intentionally create the top 10% of the category of humans.
            In that sense, White Room is established as an organization that can come up with sure results. However, we
            may not be able to create the 0.01% that would be able to fight against the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A feeling of defeat as a researcher, indeed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake was keenly aware of this through Ayanokoji Kiyotaka.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That child has no upper limit to his talent right now. He will absorb as much
            as we teach him. It could be said that he was born a genius, or that this is a result of his education in
            White Room, but I think that both of these are correct and incorrect. If Kiyotaka had not been educated in
            White Room, he would probably have been only a moderately talented person. If Kiyotaka&rsquo;s education
            continues like this in White Room, he will be an asset that will greatly increase the talent ceiling of the
            next generation of children. If Kiyotaka were to take my place and nurture these children, I think the
            children would grow up to be as big as the plastic bottles, instead of cups. &hellip;I would love to see the
            process of that happening.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An angel and a devil are arguing in my mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wonder how much he would accomplish if he were sent out into the world to lead
            Japan, instead of staying as an educator in the small White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Which choice would be better for Japan, and for the future?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is not for me to make the final judgement, but what choice will Ayanokoji-sensei
            make?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see it all through, and regardless of his choice, I will
            keep my connection to White Room for my entire life.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">I&rsquo;ve never had so much fun in my life, and I am filled with more satisfaction
            than when I was forced to flee from Japan to overseas.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But - no matter how extraordinary he is, if you ask me whether Ayanokoji
            Kiyotaka is a true genius or not, I still have my doubts. For his emotional side, he is greatly inferior to
            even average people. We don&rsquo;t know how the effects of that will be. He is imperfect.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While continuing to talk, Suzukake reached out to his phone and stopped the
            recording.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That child I&rsquo;ve produced&hellip; I wonder if he will grasp happiness
            before he dies&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He felt greatly uncomfortable recording an utterance so unbecoming of a
            researcher.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c14"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.4k668n3"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c16 c14">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was a day when the season just coincided with the blooming cherry blossoms.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I left Saitama, and returned to Tokyo for the first time in several months.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Instead of my home in Meguro where I had settled a few years ago, I drove to my
            office, which I had not visited for some time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wonder when&rsquo;s the last time I was here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked up from my car&rsquo;s window at the building which could break down any
            time, and gave the instruction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After I pulled over to the shoulder of the road, one man came out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have been away from the world of politics for a long time, but the time for my
            return is near.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe, who has been hiding in Kijima&rsquo;s shadow as a fixer, is now also 80 years
            old, and even seemed to be seriously ill at some point. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Publicly, he has returned to politics after being cured of his illness, but in
            reality his life is in a precarious state.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The proof is the acts of sabotage towards White Room and its shadow supporters by the
            Naoe side. They decided to get rid of me before their own lives would end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was indeed a hard blow that I was forced to temporarily freeze White Room, but
            I&rsquo;ve come to think that I received just the right amount of time to prepare for my
            counterattack.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Naoe got pretty old too, huh.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My war in the world of politics will start again very soon.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the omen and premonition of that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">As if congratulating me, Kamogawa appeared before me, looking just like he did when
            we spoke in the </span><span class="c36 c11">ryoutei</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;that day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It has been a long time, Ayanokoji-sensei. I did not think that you would take
            the trouble to come here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Might as well. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Are you ready?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We have been conversing on the phone, but I&rsquo;ve been having fewer chances to
            meet with him face to face than even with Sakayanagi. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because a clumsy movement would get caught in Naoe&rsquo;s web of observation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks to you, I have been handling things somehow well. There are no changes
            with you either, right, sensei?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who should be called &ldquo;sensei&rdquo;, seeing as
            you&rsquo;re repeatedly participating in elections.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I spoke so half-jokingly, Kamogawa replied with an extremely serious
            expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed, you are not a politician right now. However, you&rsquo;ve taken in a
            lot of investors, and are in charge of White Room, which is well-known only to those in the know. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Those rumours will never die off.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Indeed, I continued surviving even in this difficult environment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Although I was chased out of politics, I&rsquo;ve brought in many wealthy people with
            White Room as the starting point, and have improved my own finances to a point even beyond my own
            imagination.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My title as a politician no longer exists, but more people are calling me
            &ldquo;sensei&rdquo; now than ever before.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I heard that your son has been very successful in White Room.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that sarcasm? Because we had to temporarily close it down after overdoing
            it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa bitterly laughed, but he had the same look in his eyes as he always
            did.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, it rather looks like he is continuing to grow and develop.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think you already know, but&hellip; Naoe-sensei is pulling the strings from
            the back. I do not think he will make White Room known to the world, lest he burn himself too, but it looks
            like he is beginning to use any method possible to destroy White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If this wasn&rsquo;t that man&rsquo;s idea, I think it would have already been
            destroyed, so. I can see that the other side is having a hard time getting over this point too. What&rsquo;s
            his next move?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Things are unclear for now. I am somehow within reach of Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s
            faction, but because I used to work by your side, they do not completely trust me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even trying to force my way in, I suppose it is difficult to slip past Naoe&rsquo;s
            protective web.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is more important to rather keep hiding on the inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just - it looks like his physical condition is getting much worse
            recently.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Trying to hide his voice, Kamogawa whispered to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to bury that man with my own hands, but I suppose him dying of
            illness is the best possible outcome.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s how hard it is to find a gap in Naoe&rsquo;s defense.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Considering his age, it should be any time now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The day of your return is finally getting closer,
            Ayanokoji-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. Most importantly, even if that man is gone, that won&rsquo;t make it
            easier to stand up on the top of the world of politics. No, I think it will be even more difficult than
            before.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are right. I think Naoe-sensei was a leading figure even in the world of
            politics. However, I think that President Kijima will control him and rise even higher.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If things keep going this smoothly, the day when the record for the longest tenure
            will be broken is near.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Furthermore, he is still only 60 years old. If I handle things badly, Kijima&rsquo;s
            time will continue for 10, or 20 more years. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I, who used to be the young choice, am piling on more and more years.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is my last chance to shoot my shot.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is precisely why you want to have the perfect timing to shoot him down,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">White Room&rsquo;s temporary freeze.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t know if it will be half a year, or 5 years, but my biggest worry is
            this becoming public. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, my salvation is that the Naoe side also thinks the same way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no doubt that they are somehow trying to bury it from darkness into another
            darkness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">The car I had arranged arrived, and Tabuchi opened the rear passenger door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa also slowly entered the passenger seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tabuchi. Are the arrangements done?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As planned, the children will be supervised and handled by the temporarily
            purchased children&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your son - are you really sure?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to treat him specially just because he&rsquo;s my own son.
            However, as White Room&rsquo;s greatest creation, I can&rsquo;t say that he doesn&rsquo;t have the
            &ldquo;qualification&rdquo;. So much that even I&rsquo;m hesitating. That in itself is
            significant.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While heading for our destination, I decided to wait for Kiyotaka, who was being
            taken out of the clinic.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Still, a counseling clinic&hellip; What happened with
            Kiyotaka-kun?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, the reason we stopped by here is that there is someone who wants to meet
            Kiyotaka no matter what. He&rsquo;s a big investor, so I have no choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wants to meet him?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shallow. It&rsquo;s meant to close the wound, but he doesn&rsquo;t
            know that it will have the reverse effect.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida left the clinic and joined us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kamogawa. When was it that you last saw Kiyotaka?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, I think it has been 5, no, 6 years since I have seen your
            son. I am looking forward to seeing how well he has grown up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Looking forward?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After entering the car, Ishida glared at Kamogawa with a stern expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Umm, did I say something strange?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;</span><span class="c36 c11">That thing</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is a
            monster. He&rsquo;s not something you should look at with such soft feelings.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Monster..? He is sensei&rsquo;s son, you know, you should be careful how
            you-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Ishida is also someone who&rsquo;s been watching Kiyotaka
            grow from the start.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He can say whatever he wants about him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is more qualified to do so than someone like me, with nothing but a simple blood
            connection.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The degree of his perfection as a human being is unimaginable, considering he would
            be a 3rd year in middle school now. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, there are many things he lacks in exchange for that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That must be one of the reasons Ishida calls him a monster.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa wrinkled his eyebrows at Ishida&rsquo;s brutally honest words, and stared
            out the window.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.2zbgiuw"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">2</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The years I&rsquo;ve spent in White Room are now over 14 years, and I was at the age
            where I would finish 2nd year in middle school, as the world would call it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The real world of the outside, which differs from the virtual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">However, I don&rsquo;t feel as out of place as I thought I would, and am taking it
            all in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s unclear whether this is because of a curriculum, or the result of
            something different.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While waiting in a vacant room after Researcher Ishida&rsquo;s instructions, one man
            raised his voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kept you waiting, Ayanokoji Kiyotaka-kun. Thank you for coming here
            today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A new face, around 40 years old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From his peaceful expression, I could tell that he isn&rsquo;t related to White
            Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What caught my eyes more than that, was that he had a vase with flowers growing
            inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I haven&rsquo;t seen this thing before either. Not except in my knowledge or
            ./assets/Volume 0/images.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There was a kid I really wanted you to meet. I begged Ayanokoji-sensei to
            allow me to do so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I cannot comprehend what you are saying.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s heart is really weak, you see, and she can&rsquo;t go out as
            much as she wants. She can only keep her composure in her house, and in this clinic. That&rsquo;s why I had
            you come here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are those&hellip; Sakura flowers?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They were decorating this room, so I had them watered a little. She likes
            these. She should be back from her medical examination soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying so, he put the vase on a table by the window.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kiyotaka&hellip;.!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While waiting after the lack of explanation, the room&rsquo;s door was opened after a
            short while, and my name was yelled out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She must be at around the same age as me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The girl is looking over here with wide open eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I missed you&hellip; I missed you so much!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yuki, I&rsquo;m Yuki!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki. I have a memory of that name. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She&rsquo;s a White Room student who dropped out a long while ago. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s only natural that I still have some memories I could not intentionally
            delete from my mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if she did not die in the real sense, she is someone who lost everything after
            dropping out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A meeting with the dead. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I sense some uncomfort in this, but I wonder what the real objective of this meeting
            is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Since she left Wh-... the same place as you, my daughter Yuki has been getting
            weaker and weaker. She&rsquo;s been in low spirits. She couldn&rsquo;t leave the house, and just kept
            worrying about you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man who said so while watching from a distance seems to be Yuki&rsquo;s
            father.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is a little different than the smile she showed me when we were little, but I
            can still sense the fullness of her emotions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It really has been a long time, huh? Kiyotaka, have you&hellip; have you been
            in that place ever since?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She looks frightened to remember the past.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From looking at her father and Yuki, it seems that they do not like saying White
            Room&rsquo;s name out loud.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;All 14 years. I went outside for the first time today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You really are amazing, Kiyotaka&hellip; What about the other kids? Did
            everyone else leave?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who knows? They&rsquo;re all gone already. It&rsquo;s been years since I
            became the last one. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Including this child before me, I never cared about anyone who dropped out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alone&hellip; all that time, in that place&hellip;? I&hellip; I&hellip; that
            place&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the fear she was pushing down started to come out, Yuki&rsquo;s body started
            trembling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yuki, please stop remembering that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She&rsquo;s losing her composure after her memories were triggered. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Are all the people who dropped out this miserable?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I did understand one thing, which is that she is the child of someone significant in
            the financial world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can tell that she is being treated politely after dropping out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, if she is going to counseling, that means the wound in her heart has not
            healed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">And a method to try and heal her, was to let her meet someone else from the 4th
            period&hellip; Me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have a grasp on the situation, so I have nothing to do in this place any
            more.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;W-wait! But we just met! I, I want to talk a lot more!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to say to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the first place, if we can&rsquo;t talk about White Room, then we can&rsquo;t
            build up a conversation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Please wait, Ayanokoji-kun. Can&rsquo;t I ask you to chat with her a little?
            You can talk about anything you want. Even silly, insignificant subjects.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What would those be? You understand that this is my first time in the outside
            world, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, if you want me to lie and make things up for the sake of talking,
            then that&rsquo;s fine with me. I have no problems with being forced to converse within the limits of my
            knowledge. That isn&rsquo;t what you want, though, is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I, I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m fine with talking about W-w-white Room too,
            so!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even while breathing hard, Yuki grabbed my sleeve, not letting me go.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You should stop. You don&rsquo;t have the capacity to talk to
            me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s not true&hellip;! I always wanted to meet with you,
            Kiyotaka&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You should have stopped it there. Meeting me like this, it&rsquo;s only going
            to create a gap in your memories and ideals. If you want to get better, you should continue your treatment
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s enough now, right? If I&rsquo;m gonna waste my time here, I&rsquo;d rather
            look at the scenery outside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if only a little, I am still curious about the outside world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please. Please, just a while-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki&rsquo;s father reached out with his arms to block the exit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that an order?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No&hellip; It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, right? White Room&rsquo;s representative did not give me any
            concrete instructions.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. Ayanokoji-sensei only promised to let Yuki meet with you. This is my
            personal request.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will refuse, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wha-!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because I have decided that this is the best choice for her
            sake.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you saying that you don&rsquo;t care about her because she dropped
            out!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s exactly right. Children who dropped out don&rsquo;t matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, it was this man&rsquo;s fault to call me for the sake of counseling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t go, Kiyotaka!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s changed since back when you dropped out, huh?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You should be grateful that you were blessed with parents, and continue your
            treatment here. If you expect anything from me, you&rsquo;ll only be disappointed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! I, I want to talk with you! Like we could back then!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki&rsquo;s extremely infantile way of speaking and reactions have not changed in
            the least from back then.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please wait! Please!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please move.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s not just me. Neither my wife nor her sister can
            reach out to Yuki. They can&rsquo;t. Yet, she can talk with you. That has to be a big help for
            her..!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Goodbye. We shouldn&rsquo;t see each other again. I will take my leave
            now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nooo! No! Kiyotaka! Noooo!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image15.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The voice of the girl crying and screaming, and the man who can&rsquo;t hold himself
            back from cursing at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">None of it entered my ears. I&rsquo;m not interested.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Leaving the hospital, I returned to the car that was waiting for me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man who peeked out from the passenger seat&rsquo;s window waved at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, Kiyotaka-kun. We haven&rsquo;t met, right? My name is
            Kamogawa-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve seen this face. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With this in my mind, I sat down on an empty seat in the back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;...Nevermind, haha. Forget about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He bitterly laughed, scratched the back of his head and looked ahead.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please drive.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image16.jpg" title=""></span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Inside the silent car, I looked out to the outside world through a window.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Seeing it for the first time, what do you think about the outside
            world?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At least, it&rsquo;s not moving anything inside me that I can call emotion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s what this man, who is my father, is thinking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That I am looking out the window, but that there are no emotions inside me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">That this is no different for me than looking at the virtual world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is a big mistake.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s easier to make him think that I have it all under my
            control.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the very least, that is the most beneficial thing for me to do right now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no need to let this man realize that I am already sharpening my
            fangs.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You will continue the White Room curriculum by my side for a while. I will
            send you back to the facility when White Room reopens.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if my environment changes, there will be no obstacles as long as I have the
            skills I acquired in White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.1egqt2p"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">3</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty annoying, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After taking Kiyotaka to the mansion, I left Kamogawa behind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That there is only one ultimate perfect result. If we follow a sound strategy,
            we should let him devote his life to nurturing people who can surpass Suzukake in the white room. If we do
            this, there is a possibility that more than one person will emerge who will eventually come close to
            Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;That was the plan from the start, right? Isn&rsquo;t that good
            enough?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My return to the world of politics is starting to become a reality.
            That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s making me hesitate.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Annoyed by the fact that there is an age limit in the world of politics, this
            is the first time I&rsquo;ve thought of such a thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You want to make him, Kiyotaka-kun, into a politician..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The strategy of making him an educator in White Room and connecting to the
            next generation is the true nature of White Room. It is an unavoidable project for the sake of allowing
            Japan to take the lead in the world in the next 50 or 100 years. That hasn&rsquo;t changed for
            me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yet, in order for me to reach the summit of the world of politics, I need a
            strong ally. The earliest age that Kiyotaka can get the right to be elected and become a parliament member
            is 25. I&rsquo;ll be 61 then. I&rsquo;ll be right on the edge.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, as a politician - he will also need some time to mature and get into the
            swing of things, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, Kiyotaka will not be able to do anything immediately after becoming a
            parliament member.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Theoretically however, he can be appointed as prime minister at 25 years old, he will
            have that right.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He has the potential to be far more useful than the usual parliament members.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you plan on doing..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have an answer. If I or Kiyotaka take the lead in the world of
            politics, we can change this Japan in a big way. However, that would mean a delay in education in White
            Room. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so troubled.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The most annoying thing is that he has the title of being my children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When you enter the world of politics, the public thinks that you just want your
            second generation to take over.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Big disadvantage. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, I have an idea. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An idea that might put this disadvantage to use.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He lacks feelings of joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure, and I am very uneasy about his
            emotional side too. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is a need to improve these.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Kiyotaka-kun, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll work very obediently,
            so I would expect a lot of things from him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Obedience? Even I don&rsquo;t know to what extent Kiyotaka himself can be
            controlled.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">His brain has already far surpassed mine.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if his emotions are thin, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s already thinking far ahead
            into the future. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the other hand, I am fortunate that he is naive on some things about the world.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He hasn&rsquo;t reached the point for me to be cautious of yet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For now, I should be prepared to change my plans.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have a strong and unwavering will to take over this country.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you hang out with me for a little longer today,
            Kamogawa.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter what I do, first of all, I need to take measures relating to the formation
            of his personality.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I do not mind, but&hellip; What are we going to do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A hand appeared to lightly knock on the car&rsquo;s window, and Tsukishiro naturally
            entered the driver&rsquo;s seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Not only does this man have influence in the ruling and opposition parties, but he
            also has connections in the financial world. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t trust him too much as he always stands on the winning side, but his
            skills are still certain, even at this age.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;You look well, Ayanokoji-san. It seems like you&rsquo;ve been getting along
            quite well with the people from the Peace Party.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. What happened with the thing I asked you
            for?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The arrangements are complete. There will be no evidence left, so there
            shouldn&rsquo;t be any problems.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright. One more thing, there&rsquo;s something else I want you to ask for
            what&rsquo;s ahead of us.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I told the plan to Tsukishiro and Kamogawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Unlike Kamogawa who continued to be surprised as he listened, Tsukishiro took it all
            in with a calm smile.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is very interesting. I want to say that I would welcome the work, but I
            have gotten older too. Things may not go as they would if I was younger.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Despite his modesty, this man would not take on something he cannot do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you will leave it to me, then that is fine with me. I understand. I shall
            cooperate when you put this plan to practice. We will need to prepare some of the missing pieces for

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I instructed him to drive, and Tsukishiro started the engine.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I told Tsukishiro, whom I did not trust, only about the parts relating to
            Kiyotaka&#39;s future. </span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Thank you very much for kindly reading Volume 0.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">My favourite food is </span><span class="c36 c11">chazuke</span><span class="c2">,
            my favourite drink is black tea, and my hobby is watching baseball games. I am Kinugasa Shougo.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m itching to get a dog or a cat, but when I take vote among my family to pick
            one, they&rsquo;re always divided equally 2 against 2, so I can&rsquo;t choose either one.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Recently, I have been troubled by the fact that when I heat up frozen pasta in the
            microwave for a long time because I want it to be hot, the noodles often dry out and I end up eating them
            dry.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is it my fault, or rather the microwave oven&#39;s fault, that a pattern of repeated
            fine-tuning eventually produces the same result? It must be the latter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&mdash;Well now, let&rsquo;s stop talking about useless things and move onto the
            subject of Volume 0.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What do you think about this volume that clearly tells the entire past chapter, which
            is a secret in Youjitsu&rsquo;s publication?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">The setting of White Room existed as a document in 2015 when the story of Youjitsu
            started, but I had no idea at the time that I would dig deeper into it and write it down in a single
            volume.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c14"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As a writer, I am very happy that this has been accomplished even in this particular
            way. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was quite difficult to write the book without disturbing the pace of publication,
            but I hope that as many people as possible will be pleased with it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In fact, along with the White Year arc, there is another blank one year arc that has
            not been released to the public.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At this stage, I have no plans to publish this material in book form, but I am
            beginning to think that it would be interesting to do so if the opportunity arises in the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Well then everyone, it was pretty short, but I&rsquo;ll end it here for now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Let&rsquo;s meet again at the afterword of the next volume. See ya!</span></p>

    <p class="c41 c28"><span class="c24">Thank you, the reader, for reading this Translation of Volume 0. I hope you had
            fun. This was finally the volume where Kiyotaka Ayanokoji&rsquo;s past was revealed and boy was it
            interesting. For sure this volume would be in the Top 5 Cote volumes for most. All the insights into new
            characters and some familiar names popping up hyped me a lot for the future. There was also a lot revealed
            about the &lsquo;outside world&rsquo; which was interesting. And it left me wondering&hellip; How is it
            going to Connect to things in the Future? Well, it seems like we might get our answer in the next few
            upcoming volumes. Speaking of which&hellip; The Next Volume is Classroom of the Elite Year 2 Volume 9!
            which, I believe will spark a lot of Debate. As it is clear from the Already available information that it
            might have some major decisions and events in the world of Cote. For the Release date - &nbsp;It is supposed
            to be released on 25th February, 2023. As for the Estimated time of translation, I would say it might remain
            the same. However, I will try to make the translation time as shorter as possible while making sure that the
            translation quality doesn&rsquo;t get affected. So, Look forward to it. I am really excited for Year 2
            Volume 9 and for more updated information on it you can follow me </span><span class="c24 c29"><a class="c6"
