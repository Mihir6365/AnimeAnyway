    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tokyo was unusually covered in a great amount of snow. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Today, at the end of January, I was in the Sazagawa </span><span
            class="c36 c11">ryokan</span><span class="c2">.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The garden I could see from the window in the corridor was lit up and the
            night&rsquo;s snowy scenery spread before my eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa and I leisurely headed towards the meeting place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the way, Kamogawa stopped in his tracks and stared at the snowy scenery.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you remember? When we were waiting for Naoe-sensei under the cold sky more
            than 10 years ago.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, like it was just the other day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That day, you were put in charge of the White Room project, and I was also
            appointed. There were a lot of difficulties, but we were able to get this far.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is very true. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have more than a couple stories that I will take to the grave without telling
            anyone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grown a lot too. I think you&rsquo;ve come to understand how
            politics works.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you. I was able to progress a lot working under Naoe-sense and you,
            Ayanokoji-san&hellip; no, Ayanokoji-sensei. My only regret is that I can&rsquo;t tell my father, who passed
            away last year, about all that we&rsquo;ve done, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Around this time last year, Kamogawa&rsquo;s father collapsed and died because of a
            heart attack.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Kamogawa wanted to directly let him know about the announcement of the White
            Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That the country is arranging an organization to take in and raise children.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Right now, the Advanced Nurturing High School for high school students is already
            running ahead of us, but we will go above that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An organization to save the lives of the children who are born.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An organization to educate and turn the children into geniuses.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The White Room plan is something that will be an inevitable necessity for the world
            of the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lives being thrown into the toilet. Lives being ended by abortion. Lives being killed
            by negligence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Under the government&rsquo;s guidance, this will all disappear.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This plan is also a measure against the declining birth rates.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We will put out such results that they will reach the heavens. Don&rsquo;t be
            satisfied by today, Kamogawa.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Y-yes!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is a special day. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Different from back then, when we were waiting under the cold sky for
            Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After many twists and turns, the White Room experiment has started showing real
            results.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Today, finally, I will give a detailed report to Naoe-sensei, and go out onto the
            front stage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My steps towards the sun begins now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without blood, hard work, and courage, I would not have succeeded.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We sat down on our seats first, and began waiting for Naoe-sensei who is to appear on
            the seat of honor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know it would be more mannerful to wait outside, but this is an instruction from
            Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">In other words, I understand that he also intends to show me his gratitude with
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;After announcing this project, Naoe-sensei will finally rise up to the summit
            of this country.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Prime minister&hellip; right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With this, preparations for the coming election are perfectly complete.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not a simple prime minister. He won&rsquo;t just have the honor, but also more
            actual power than any in history.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the true sense, I can say that he will be the man at the top of this
            country.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t normally get nervous, but I can tell today that my heart is beating a
            little faster.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because I&rsquo;ve gambled my political life on this project.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This day, when I will be rewarded for it all&hellip; I saw it in my dreams many, many
            times.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Naoe-sensei has arrived.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After a long seeming but short 30 minutes, the notice of Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s arrival
            reached us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It was faster than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only 10 minutes later than the agreed time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After intending to wait for one, or two more hours without minding, I was
            surprised.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now, I will seal my soft emotions, and begin a stern conversation with
            Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Before the curtain opened, we lowered our heads, almost touching the ground.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I started hearing Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s confident and silent footsteps.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry I kept you waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After his arrival, Naoe-sensei apologized for being late.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could not help but feel something strange towards these words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, not at all. Thank you very much for taking the trouble to visit us in this
            cold today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After saying so, I cleared away the unnecessary thoughts from my mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is nothing to worry about.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no mistaking it, I will climb up and fulfill my ambitions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Raise &nbsp;your heads first. I can&rsquo;t talk like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa and I raised our heads, and I reached out to a glass to pour beer for
            Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, Naoe-sensei stopped me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We should talk before that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I apologize.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I quickly pulled away, and began listening to Sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;There is a lot to talk about, but&hellip; First, let&rsquo;s start with
        </span><span class="c36 c11">that</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After a slight hesitation, Naoe-sensei muttered so as if he remembered something he
            had forgotten.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the election for the next prime minister. I decided to pass on my
            candidacy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For a moment, I could not comprehend what Naoe-sensei was saying, and for the first
            time gave such a stupid reply.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa next to me must also be the same.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Among the quietness, an ear-scratching ringing sound was heard.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sensei, that is&hellip; Some kind of joke, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The words came out of Kamogawa&rsquo;s mouth, not as a confirmation, but as a
            reflex.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if he did not want to speak out of turn, I&rsquo;m sure I would have said the
            same thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth. The candidates will be lined up tomorrow, and I will be
            voting for Kijima. I will also make you vote for him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kijima? Why is Naoe-sensei supporting Kijima-sensei?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how young and promising he is, Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s position is
            higher.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please wait. Why? Naoe-sensei, what about all of your preparations for this
            time?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Pitching forward, I could not push down my emotions no matter how much I
            tried.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know that becoming the cabinet&rsquo;s prime minister is not everything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In fact, Naoe-sensei before me has been reigning for many years as a shadow fixer
            without a position, even though he has had many opportunities.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it is still the default route for him to become the Prime Minister
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Rather, if he doesn&rsquo;t run here&hellip; It is essentially the same thing as
            giving up the seat of the prime minister.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he gives his seat up to Kijima-sensei once, that person will unmistakably keep his
            position.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s faction will start losing its centripetal force, and he
            won&rsquo;t have the opportunity to become prime minister again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he withdraws, one can&rsquo;t help but think that something bad has happened.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, it will have a big effect on White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is precisely because I understood all this as an instinct, that I had to
            confirm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The most surprising of all was the fact that the one Naoe-sensei decided to support
            was Kijima-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;K-Kijima sensei&hellip; He&rsquo;s a clear enemy of yours, Naoe-sensei&hellip;
            Right..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Not able to hold back either, Kamogawa said the name out loud.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The candidates from the Citizens Party were narrowed down to three including those
            from inside and outside the government, and including the mass media. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The favourite being Naoe-sensei before me, the follower up being his rival Isomaru
            from the same period, and Kijima-sensei a bit further behind. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">These three are the only ones who have a ticket to become the prime minister, and
            Naoe-sensei should have been the leading candidate.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to make him the prime minister, but I ended up having to
            do just that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you saying you could not gather the votes..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The votes inside the Citizens Party had been cleanly split
            between me, Isomaru, and Kijima, but, it looks like a part of the rival party has decided to crush me. The
            results ended up being that I lacked from 20 to 30 votes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am sure he tried many strategies already, but I saw Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s smile of
            resignation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Even if I play a good match, if I lose, I lose a lot of centripetal force. In
            which case, the only choice is to support Kijima and protect my position, isn&rsquo;t it? He&rsquo;s still
            young, and he has a lot of momentum. After thoroughly searching, he is not involved in any scandals
            either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Women, money, a politician with nothing to feel guilty of.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, he has also always been in good health.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;However, in that case, isn&rsquo;t it better to support Isomaru-sensei? Even
            if you are rivals from the same period, you are acquaintances. I don&rsquo;t think you need to support
            Kijima-sensei, who is difficult to handle, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t have childish thoughts such as wanting to give the
            credit to someone from the same period.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he judges that it is the correct thing to be under Kijima-sensei, then there will
            be no hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You get it already, don&rsquo;t you? The answer is that it is more beneficial
            to be under Kijima. If I force myself onto Isomaru&rsquo;s ship now, the possibility of going down along
            with him is high. Between the two, most in my faction also want to support Kijima.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is the fear that even Naoe-sensei will be resisted if he tries to forcefully go
            over to Isomaru-sensei&rsquo;s side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had no idea that he was driven into a corner like this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought I understood everything about the political world, but it looks like even I
            didn&rsquo;t know what was going on behind the scenes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&hellip; It is too early to give up, Naoe-sensei. We still have the White
            Room project! If we use this as a weapon, we can-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop, Kamogawa.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">I strongly restrained Kamogawa who was trying to get to grips with this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If Naoe-sensei has made such a decision, then we must follow it. However, you
            understand that the White Room is a different issue, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Supporting Kijima-sensei, Naoe-sensei will naturally be appointed again. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, it should already be confirmed that his position will not change
            much. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can say that this will not have that much of an impact.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji. That&rsquo;s the matter I came to see you for today. After all
            these years of your hard work, I am sorry, but, I need you to keep quiet for a while.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The last words I wanted to hear came flying out, and my cold sweats started flowing
            out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...What does that mean, Naoe-sensei?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While beginning to understand the situation, I still could not accept it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand what you want to say. However, all of this will only happen if I
            can maintain my current position. You get it, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sure, I&#39;ve been unofficially promised my next post. However, it&rsquo;s
            not something I&#39;ve won. It was the last stronghold that I defended after losing the factional war. I
            can&rsquo;t promote the White Room project, which has a high possibility of attracting
            controversy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If Naoe Sensei makes a bad move, Kijima-sensei&rsquo;s side will not remain
            silent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is obvious that he would be suspected of trying to gain more influence by
            increasing his achievements again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I understand that logic very well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji. You are an excellent man.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Yes. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;After I picked up a have-not like you, you should know very well that I
            don&rsquo;t solely judge people on the basis of academic record.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The world of politics has always required a certain academic record. If it was
            not for you, Naoe-sensei, no one would have employed a man like me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei nodded, and sighed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;For better or worse, people who have been involved in politics for a long time
            tend to follow their educational background and become incompetent. They care about nothing other than
            keeping their title as a politician. Both the politicians who want justice, and the ones who aim to be the
            bad guys get swallowed on the way all the same.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei was about to pick up the empty glass, but quickly pulled his hand
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Despite that, Kijima never changes. That fucking man is a real
            politician.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t think that Naoe-sensei has ever praised someone with words like
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is already doing the analysis of a war that has ended.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I felt it with you too. Your direction is different, but you&rsquo;re also a
            man that doesn&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Yes. Neither my conviction nor my ideals will ever change.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;This country&rsquo;s peak point&hellip; That was your aim,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No hesitation, huh? However, that is to say that you want to defeat Kijima.
            He&rsquo;s a considerable foe, you know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have the will. However, if you are saying that you will support
            Kijima-sensei, then please let me obey. From now on, for you, and for Kijima-sensei, I will-&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I said it before too, but I need you to stay quiet for a while.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ah, I see.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I did have a bad feeling about this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This means that I was right.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become an eyesore for Kijima. It&rsquo;s reached his ears many
            times that you&rsquo;ve been involved in the business world in a gaudy way these few years. Do you
            understand? I can&rsquo;t have someone like that under me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I only want to do as you instruct me, Sensei. To create a facility that will
            surpass ANHS education, to change this country&hellip; Did you not tell me to be thorough?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s expression changed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Managing the White Room wasn&rsquo;t fucking enough for you, so you&rsquo;ve
            gathered up quite a lot of money too. You have connections with the yakuza too, and you&rsquo;re not just a
            simple politician. Right? Isn&rsquo;t that so? Did I tell you to do that much? You&rsquo;ve been maneuvering
            for your own damn benefit. How many fires do you think I&rsquo;ve put out these few years?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">His demeanour changed, and before I could notice, I was being strongly
            scolded.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then&hellip; What do you intend on doing about the White Room
            project?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? A clean slate.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; A clean slate..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamagawa, who had been explaining his joy up until just now, suddenly changed his
            expression to one of despair.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Stiff as a statue, I can&rsquo;t deny that I had a stern expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A clean slate for the White Room project?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Does he know how hard I&rsquo;ve worked up until now?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He can&rsquo;t just sweep it all away with only the two words of &ldquo;clean
            slate&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&hellip;No, it was always this way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s word, everything moves from right to left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This isn&rsquo;t anything special.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I get clumsy and show resistance here, it will only make Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s mood
            worse.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if only slightly, he must have come all the way here because he felt bad for us
            novices.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to be an adult here and react calmly, or I will lose my footing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">If I get dismissed as an impertinent man, there won&rsquo;t be a second chance for
            me to be of use.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I gained enough money to gather the envy of others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if I am abandoned by Naoe-sensei, I can probably keep on living.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, as a politician&hellip; That would be it for me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With that, my ambition would all come to nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t take it personally.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is it all over with this?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t think Naoe-sensei intends on leisurely dining here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t hold the glass once up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When Kijima accepts that you have no fangs, I&rsquo;ll put you out in front
            again. You&rsquo;re fine with that, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To keep surviving as a politician.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I will throw away the White Room, and start again from scratch.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the best choice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know-</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;...Please stop screwing around with me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This time, I couldn&rsquo;t handle myself calmly and wisely as usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no way I could.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">How hard does he think I&rsquo;ve worked for the sake of this project?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In these ten years, I gave everything up and grinded my body to dust.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I won&rsquo;t let it all be for nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;White Room is receiving a lot of funding and continuing to operate. There is
            no way I can withdraw now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Who the fuck do you think you&rsquo;re talking to,
            Ayanokoji?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This incalculably overwhelming attitude before me, unfitting of an old man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without showing fear or timidity before my boldness, he simply looked at me with his
            pitch black pupils.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For Naoe-sensei who has been in the world of politics for decades, this kind of
            attitude is a daily occurrence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yet, I can&rsquo;t pull back here now just because of that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After pulling the bow, there is no more going back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I told you to return it to a clean slate. If you can&rsquo;t do that, just
            fucking hang yourself and die.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you saying that now, after all this time?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who gives a shit about your &ldquo;after all this time?&rdquo; &rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I cannot accept this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you can accept it or not, I&rsquo;m telling you
            that it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then what will become of me? I looked up only to you, and threw away many
            opportunities for the sake of this project. Even if I can protect my title as a politician, it is pointless
            if I can&rsquo;t do anything with it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just have to endure for a few years. When that&rsquo;s over,
            I&rsquo;ll give you your next job.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Can I believe him?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no way I can.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Under your instructions, I have been working only for this project. I
            cannot&hellip; I cannot accept such an illogical thing..!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to lament.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have no choice but to do so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand how you feel. But you should know how these things work. This is
            the kind of world we&rsquo;re in. So don&rsquo;t hate me, and keep backing me up. I was the one pushing you
            to help with the project&rsquo;s progress, right? You were able to get elected with minimal work thanks to
            that. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Indeed, I left all of the normal election processes up to Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">And I am grateful to him for making me get elected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am grateful for that. However-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Stop it, Ayanokoji. You&rsquo;ll lose your footing if you get obsessed over
            one project.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why am I becoming so frantic?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure Kamogawa sitting silently beside me can&rsquo;t even imagine
            why.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not because I hate the idea of the White Room project ending and
            continuing to cling onto it. It&rsquo;s because I understand the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This means that for Naoe-sensei, &ldquo;I&rdquo; have become something that needs to
            be used up and abandoned.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He will put me aside until the election time while telling me he will give me another
            chance, and when the time comes, he will cut me away without giving me any support.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Up until now, I&rsquo;ve seen many politicians get cut off in the same manner right
            in front of my eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, when I was told the words &ldquo;clean slate&rdquo;, my destiny as a
            politician was decided.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In that case, my instincts that want to resist until the end chose to fight.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In other words, you want me to be the only one covered in mud&hellip;
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still young. Unlike me, who doesn&rsquo;t have much time left,
            you will have many other chances. But this is it for me. I can&rsquo;t pull back here. I want to die as a
            politician, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sensei&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling you to quit being a politician. All you have to do is
            stay obedient.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sensei, you will not abandon me or anything like that, right?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. I won&rsquo;t do anything bad to you. I spoke harshly, but, on the
            other hand, it seems like Kijima also values you highly. If you stay quiet, the bowl will come around. I can
            let you hold it when that time comes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s all over&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see, good.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As you are telling me to, I will end the White Room project. I will start
            moving tomorrow to conduct the after processings.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I deeply bowed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You do that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei before my eyes no longer held even the slightest interest towards
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I am skilled or not. What matters is that he has to
            abandon me along with the project, and that he will no longer use me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The only things in the room after Naoe-sensei left were Kamogawa crying and
            collapsing, and the cold food.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;What a fucking joke!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I yelled out with anger.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll give the bowl to me later on? Don&rsquo;t make me
            laugh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you drop out from the world of politics once, it&rsquo;s already over.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I plan for a second coming, I will be crushed and
            ended.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are we going to do now..? Is it all over with this?
            Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Should I have beat him up..?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, there&rsquo;s no meaning in doing that and gaining momentary satisfaction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I would be arrested right away, and lose not just my status as a politician, but
            everything else I&rsquo;ve gained up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s fine to show your strength in a physical fight if it&rsquo;s a quarrel
            between brats.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, in this world, physical strength is only one of the many weapons one can
            hold, and its effectiveness is weak.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe, while looking like nothing more than a frail old man, holds an innumerable
            amount of weapons.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that you can use me up and get rid of me so easily,
            Naoe&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I strongly hit the table with my fist, and spat out my anger.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Putting everything short, I was used up well and abandoned.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the world of politics, there is no hope of getting back up if you fall down
            once.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Am I finished?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if put to words, I can&rsquo;t feel any sense of reality towards this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">How much does he think I&rsquo;ve anguished and sweated for the sake of moving this
            country, for the sake of rising to its summit?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Does he know how much I&rsquo;ve been humiliated, insulted, and scorned?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That man is of no more use to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, even if I try to fight back now in a new manner, I will simply be crushed
            and ended. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can say that until that man retires, no, dies, the path of my success is completely
            closed off.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then&hellip; This also means that if that man dies, I will have the chance to move
            again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Do I contact Ooba, and have Naoe killed..?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What a stupid idea&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I make such a request, it&rsquo;ll only end up with Ooba abandoning me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t even need to think about which option would be more beneficial.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kamogawa. Come to your senses, you&rsquo;re going to start everything again
            from tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; That&rsquo;s all I can do, but&hellip; Ayanokoji-sensei,
            what will you do? You will not ignore Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s order, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...It&rsquo;s all over for me, no matter what. My treatment won&rsquo;t change
            now even if I stop resisting. In which case, I will continue managing the White Room even if I stop being a
            politician.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;P-Please wait! I respect you so much, Ayanokoji-sensei! I think you&rsquo;re
            the kind of man who will surpass Naoe-sensei one day! Please don&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;ll
            retire!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;My path is already set. I can&rsquo;t change it any more. But, you can still
            save yourself. Your father&rsquo;s influence still remains.</span><span class="c11 c30">&nbsp;</span><span
            class="c2">So you should keep fighting as a politician under Naoe.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-sensei&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give up politics, or White Room. But I will throw politics away
            for a moment.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is the one and only method.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No matter how much power Naoe has, he can&rsquo;t beat me in lifespan. One
            day, he will die before me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If it&rsquo;s going to take time anyway, then I can just wait.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I will satisfy the old man and wait out his short political life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, when that&rsquo;s over, I&rsquo;ll&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just Kijima. When I come back to the world of politics,
            I&rsquo;ll burn his son to ashes too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Haha&hellip; When you&rsquo;re the one saying it, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like
            a joke.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Wiping away his tears and saying so, Kamogawa smiled.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.28h4qwu"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">2</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After putting Kamogawa in a taxi and letting him leave, I started walking alone on
            the snowy road.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wanted to be alone, and cool down my hot head.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to think about the future. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s precisely why I need to know everything that is to come, and make the
            calculations in my head. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I made a call to that man with my phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was late at night, but I was convinced that the call would certainly
            connect.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tsukishiro, answer me. Why did Naoe stick with Kijima, even throwing away our
            own positions?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is going to be an interesting call, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you know everything. Right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Up until now, Naoe-sensei thought that he was the best politician. However, he
            learned something, that Kijima is a presence even surpassing him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How foolish.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The two have very different ideals, but they surprisingly also have a lot of
            common points.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;With that&hellip; Am I supposed to be convinced with that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kijima-sensei is not happy about the White Room, which you&rsquo;ve taken part
            in.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you saying? That man has ANHS education. He can even come out with it
            as his second policy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is certainly one of his main policies. However, he was also working on a
            similar new plan behind the scenes. In other words, his second policy was already in motion. It would not
            have been desirable for him to have it come out ahead of time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Is that the reason Naoe abandoned me..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t clear at which stage it was, but word of White Room has
            reached Kijima-sensei&rsquo;s ears. I think I can say that he talked with Naoe-sensei, and promised to let
            him keep his position afterwards if he brought it to a halt.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So Kijima had also thought of a plan that resembled White Room, huh?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is not just that. You were much more capable than Naoe-sensei had even
            imagined. He relied on you a lot in these few years, but at the same time, did you not also think that he
            had a lot of unreasonable demands?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think that is because Sensei was afraid of you. It was as if he was waiting
            to crush you one day, rather than to make use of you. However, you did not fail. No, we cannot say that you
            did not have any failures at all. However, you conducted yourself well, erased any signs of failure and made
            sure you did not stand out. I have to admit that is quite the skill. Naoe-sensei did not raise you to put
            you on the top. I think that he was expecting you to support his son as his right hand when he rose up to
            the top of the country in the future. Sensei could see ahead in everything, but he made one miscalculation.
            Your limitless ambition, it seems that was the only thing he did not understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After 10 years, even Naoe-sense won&rsquo;t be able to crush me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So, he played his hand now, as to prevent that from happening.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Do I consider it as a handout to his son, or a result of his fear that I would crush
            his son?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Were you satisfied with the answer?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Why did you talk honestly?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you were a man who would be crushed here, I would not have talked. However,
            my intuition tells me that this isn&rsquo;t the case. One day, you will be back on the front stage. With
            even greater power. That is the reason I talked.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is a wise judgement. Naturally, however, do you intend on showing up no
            matter how I fall?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is the question.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man will not rely solely on me. He is already someone else&rsquo;s ally, and it
            is the same for me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I am judged to be incapable, I am sure he will throw me away in that
            instant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can sell my information to Naoe or anyone you want. In exchange, I will
            receive information from you. I am sure that a situation where we both can observe each other is preferable
            for both sides.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am aware.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It seems we will associate with each other for a long time,
            Tsukishiro.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I hope so. If you have any requests, please contact me any time,
            Ayanokoji-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying so, Tsukishiro hung up the phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s right, I won&rsquo;t be finished here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I will thoroughly prepare myself to protect my own life for the future, and gather my
            strength.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">And at the same time, I will create my soldiers in White Room.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">200 meters tall, 50 floors.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The banquet floor in the middle of the ultra high-class hotel fighting for the top
            position in Tokyo. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Arriving slightly later than the planned time, I started going up in the elevator
            while thinking upon some things.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It costs about 3,000,000 to rent the floor for 3 hours and to serve meals for 60
            people.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I could say &ldquo;only&rdquo;, that would be about it, but considering my
            uncertain financial circumstances, it&rsquo;s not cheap.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The party has been continuing every year since the operation of the facility started,
            and it&rsquo;s been getting larger each time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to collect a bigger amount of contributions than ever before.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Many investors turned their backs to me by Naoe&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s obvious from the fact that the 200 supporters I&rsquo;ve had before
            decreased to 60.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Money, I need money. I have to scrape together manyfolds of money.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The necessary thing here today is to show my own strength.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked at my own eyes reflecting in the metal glass of the massive elevator.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve gotten quite old too&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Looking back, I can calmly reflect on my own aging.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I think I can say that the fact that I&rsquo;ve started and continued managing White
            Room is a miracle.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I am only half-way through.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">It&rsquo;s been some time since I was banished from the financial world, but the
            fires of my ambition, let alone being extinguished, are burning even hotter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I reached my destination, got out of the elevator and headed to a vacant room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Losing my title as a politician, I am now treated as a former politician.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Normally, my cohesive power would have reduced greatly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the title of the man in charge of White Room is increasing my power.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, the people I call investors would not have gathered in
            this place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-sensei, it is about time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is a lot to think about, but the most important problem to solve is the
            money.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the scale gets larger, White Room requires more and more funding.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In order to provide this financing, I need more than an amount of money to use and
            throw away; I need money to keep living.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;S-sorry I kept you waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem calm, huh? Besides, how many times have you gone to the
            toilet now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tabuchi, coming back to the vacant room, sat down on a chair in an uncalm demeanour,
            and started slightly shaking his left leg.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When are you going to get rid of that habit?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am sorry, but, when I think about the possibility of missing this
            chance&hellip; I feel uneasy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Indeed, if the funding is short, White Room will be in big trouble.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It will be alright if it just ends with a temporary freeze, but it is critical that
            the children&rsquo;s education does not stop too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is the same as the baby birds you&rsquo;ve raised getting sick and dying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Listen, Tabuchi. We can&rsquo;t turn our backs to the fact that this is our
            last chance. However, that is precisely why we have to strongly step ahead without looking back. You can
            think about failure if we fail.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The shaking of his left leg became slow, and Tabuchi looked up to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thinking about the difficulties we&rsquo;ve gone through up until now, this
            isn&rsquo;t anything special. Used up and abandoned by Naoe, ordered to bring White Room to a halt, and
            losing my title as politician.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Still, I did not stop moving.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can proudly say that I have led such a difficult life that I can&rsquo;t even begin
            to tell other people about it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Leaving aside people like Naoe and Kijima, it isn&rsquo;t easy for even a mere
            politician to have an audience for me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I did lose my title as a politician, but there is no mistaking the fact that
            I&rsquo;ve surpassed my past self.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I noticed that Tabuchi had stopped shaking his leg, and was clenching his fist with
            strength.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to show this to the people who believe in White Room, I can&rsquo;t let them
            regret it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s battle, is there any chance for victory?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Of course. Do you know what a weapon that is easily usable by anyone
            is?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Huh? Is there such a thing?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is. Of course, it is a double-edged sword with risk. It&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;lie&rdquo;.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lie&hellip; Is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There are those in the world of politics that have risen up with just one lie.
            That is how much power there is in lies.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, there is only a point to this if you can use lies well in the first place,
            though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We will fully utilize this weapon. Let&rsquo;s go, Tabuchi, this is do-or-die
            for White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Yes!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.37m2jsg"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">4</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The first thing that the rich do is to compete with each other on the surface level
            with high class clothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Next, houses, cars, and asserting dominance in their company.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, they sometimes move on to an unexpected point after all this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Normally, these parties are only attended by adults, and you wouldn&rsquo;t see many
            children around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, when it is the top class of the financial world, the number of children
            rather increases in one breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is of course to make their kids meet each other with the future in mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Businesses with cooperative relations, and businesses with relations of
            rivalry.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">No matter the position, it isn&rsquo;t a bad thing to make the inheritors meet with
            each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Above all, the parents bring them in thinking that their own children are
            excellent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if showing off their most prized toy, they duel with their unique cards.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is precisely why I can say that White Room is a factor that can be accepted by
            the financial world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmph&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s ironic. I&rsquo;ve learned this ability of judgement, this sense of value,
            all from Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He&rsquo;s turned to become my hated enemy, but his strength was unmatched, and the
            real thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The party just started. First, I&rsquo;ll greet everyone and show my face all around
            the floor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time, Ayanokoji-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was speaking out to a variety of people, a middle-aged man with a young looking
            face approached me with a bright attitude.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I quickly changed to my business face, turned around and put out my right
            hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It has been a while, Director Amasawa. Around two years, I think. After
            sending the invitation letter, I was worried that you would not do me the favor of coming
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t come here last year. She really wanted to
            spend her birthday in Hawaii, and wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me. Work has been busy too, and I couldn&rsquo;t
            come up with the time. So, in the end, I bought a house in Hawaii, and I&rsquo;ve been there
            since.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am glad to hear that your work and private life are going
            well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">He should be slightly older than me, but he does not make me feel that in a bad
            way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Covered in brands liked by the young, he&rsquo;s wearing sandals unfitting for a
            place like this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lacking in the dress code in this way, he could even have been rejected at the door
            by someone who doesn&rsquo;t know anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He&rsquo;s not ordinary. He must be trying to make that fact clear by looking
            different.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I do not favour this man&rsquo;s clothing style, nor his thinking, but as he is one
            of the people investing in White Room, I can&rsquo;t be harsh with him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t participate in the party last year, but I was still able to get the
            investment money from him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He&rsquo;s someone I should treat as the exact kind of man that I should welcome with
            open arms.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It seems like you aren&rsquo;t a sensei anymore, but I can&rsquo;t feel that
            from you at all. You look like an evil politician, no matter how you look at it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He laughed leisurely while tapping me on the shoulder with the palm of his
            hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We can stay in contact, just like when I was a politician,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. I value you very highly, you know, Ayanokoji-sensei.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While continuing the boring conversation, I thought back on the first words Amasawa
            uttered.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While this man is married, it is clear that this &ldquo;she&rdquo; or whatever he
            spent time with in Hawaii is not his spouse.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Can we talk a bit?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While laughing foolishly, Amasawa guided me towards a window.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Actually, there&rsquo;s something I wanted to ask of you,
            Ayanokoji-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A request from you? Just what could that be?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Actually, that girl in Hawaii got pregnant. Further, she insists on giving
            birth in Japan.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is a joyous occasion, but it is a bit troublesome, is it
            not?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. My wife also seems to have suspicions of me cheating, and if it
            gets out that a secret child was born, I would be in a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re going to play around, then you should just not get married in the
            first place, but I suppose that&rsquo;s a different issue.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Even though there&rsquo;s no way she can raise a child, she&rsquo;s afraid of
            losing contact with me. Otherwise, someone who loves Hawaii so much wouldn&rsquo;t want to give birth in
            Japan.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While shrugging with worry, he doesn&rsquo;t look to be in that much of a
            panic.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d like the child to be educated in White Room, but&hellip; How
            about it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Will she consent to that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;She will, she will. What she wants is to give birth to my child, in other
            words, that&rsquo;s her goal. She certainly doesn&rsquo;t want to be a mother and raise a
            child.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For me, I would welcome another child that brings no danger along with them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, there are many things I need to confirm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already taken your daughter into White Room, Director
            Amasawa.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no problem with another one coming in, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;If necessary, I of course will not object. However, are you
            sure?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, isn&rsquo;t it? She&rsquo;ll have the achievement of having
            given birth, I&rsquo;ll have pushed a troublesome kid onto White Room, and you&rsquo;ll profit from it. A
            happy end for everyone, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man thinks that White Room is just a useful creche or something like
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, this is also convenient for me, and just what I need.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You know the contents of this party, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I do. I will invest, of course. Generously. Alright?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying so, he raised one finger.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Double the amount of last year. I&rsquo;ll put out 100,000,000. If I can buy
            safety with that, then it&rsquo;s a cheap price to pay.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much. Do you know the expected delivery date?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, wait a bit. She messaged it to me, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He told me the hospital and the expected delivery date from his phone, and I
            contacted my subordinates to instruct them to move with the preparations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then, I will handle this without delay.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Nodding with satisfaction, he grabbed two glasses of champagne from a waiter walking
            around nearby.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I took the glass with a tinkle, and gulped it down in one breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;By the way, Director Amasawa. You know the rules of White Room, yes? Unless
            there is a special reason, meeting face to face is fundamentally impossible. You can only regularly meet the
            child after they become an adult, or leave White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mhm. I&rsquo;ve heard all that before, you know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are really sure, right? This is not an exception even for the
            mother.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. If you just regularly send her photos, she&rsquo;ll be
            convinced.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I can get funding, I don&rsquo;t care the manner in which I get it, but I do have
            to keep up appearances.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is also one more thing I need to confirm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Director. I think it has been a while since we took in your first daughter,
            but you have not come to see her even once yet. Have you thought about what that means for the
            future?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Parents who don&rsquo;t come to check up on their child are very rare.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Normally, they come and check on their growth and see how they&rsquo;re doing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Please do as you want with her future and everything else. In the first
            place, </span><span class="c11 c36">that</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was a baby created in a test tube, and
            I don&rsquo;t see her as my real child in the least.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Amasawa told me without much interest that it was just something he did for
            play.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">White Room has taken in all kinds of children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are test tube babies, and sometimes we even take one child from among siblings
            to test how good the education in White Room is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">I have to observe the other party&rsquo;s circumstances and feelings, and keep them
            in mind as to not displease them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I shall freely do everything on my side, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So far, she has grown up to be the second best among the 5th period students. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Considering that she is just as capable as the boys, if she doesn&rsquo;t drop out, I
            will be able to find some use for her skills.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. Do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He tapped me on the shoulder again in a familiar manner, and started happily
            humming.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Some people who have amassed billions and billions of assets think that their
            children have no value.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They are very rare, but this means that Amasawa is one of them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He does not feel that his child is a sign of his status, and only cares about
            himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home now. I want to enjoy Japan for the first time in a long
            time, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you seen out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I left the happy Amasawa in the hands of my subordinate and saw him off on the
            spot.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I felt like I wanted to take a break, but there was no time to rest.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.1mrcu09"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">5</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had already hurriedly greeted the bigwigs I needed to talk to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">So after Amasawa, I spoke with several directors and succeeded in obtaining new
            funding.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It hasn&rsquo;t reached the informal target amount yet, but I can say that things are
            progressing favourably.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An hour has passed since the party started.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Here, I decided to take a small rest.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because of all the chatting I did, my throat also feels a little tired.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I won&rsquo;t waste time even while stopping.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s important to confirm the atmosphere on the spot and check into the tone of
            the situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I approached a waiter to grab a glass of wine, I felt a light shock run through
            my feet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A running child hit into me, and ran away without even apologizing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wondered where he was rushing towards, and it was the corner of the venue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It looks like many children are gathering in that spot.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As most of the parents know each other in various ways, it&rsquo;s only natural that
            the children they brought along also know each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As they are a bit separated from the adults, the children&rsquo;s high voices are
            echoing around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So much that I can say they are screaming. When they become grouped up, they&rsquo;re
            almost unstoppable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I approached to warn them, but I noticed that they weren&rsquo;t playing
            around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All boys, including the running child. However, 3 children among the 5 are
            surrounding one child, yelling and grilling him. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The one other child is watching them from some distance, but I see no fear in his
            expression. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">There is a risk that the children will notice me if I get closer, so</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I stopped. Because I was a little interested in what they were talking about.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They must be around the same age as Kiyotaka. I normally don&rsquo;t come in contact
            with ordinary children, so I&rsquo;m also interested in comparing them with the children in White
            Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I tried probing into them a little, but the children looked to be in a very hostile
            mood.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most children easily start fights without knowing the right or the wrong place for
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That also doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you really get an autograph from Kazuya?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The child who was running seemed to be the leader, and pressed for an answer while
            seeming to control the other children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I, I did.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He answered so while averting his gaze.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I only just took a glance, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be telling the truth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying, right? When I met Kazuya, he said that he doesn&rsquo;t
            normally give out autographs.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where did you get the autograph?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He, he came to my house.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! So you are lying. Because Kazuya told me that I was the first child he
            gave an autograph to outside the venue.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I, I&rsquo;m saying I really did get one! I got him to sign&hellip; my soccer
            ball&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It looks like they were talking about their suspicion of this child receiving an
            autograph or not from a japanese athlete called Kazuya that is active overseas.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Including the leader, the 3 children are accusing the 1 weak-spirited child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I suppose the suspiciousness of the accused child&rsquo;s demeanour is also clear to
            the children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It looks like he&rsquo;s having some hard time because of a cheap lie he made up for
            the sake of bragging.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a majority decision then. About who thinks this guy is lying
            or not.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Immediately, laughing, the three children raised their hands in collusion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The one boy who was silent did not raise his hand, so they naturally asked him to do
            so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Which side are you on, Ryuuji?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps knowing everyone, the child in lead called him by his first name.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...It has nothing to do with me. I don&rsquo;t care either way.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s that? I&rsquo;m asking you which one it
            is.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If I am to judge objectively, I think he&rsquo;s lying. He should just
            apologize already.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, it&rsquo;s a natural decision. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The child called Ryuuji decided that he was lying, and encouraged him to apologize.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Considering the difference in numbers and physique, there&rsquo;s little benefit to
            protecting him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s best to apologize here, but humans don&rsquo;t always make the best
            decisions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not a lie&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Looking at the child insisting that he isn&rsquo;t lying, Ryuuji sighed with
            boredom.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What about you just forgive him already? It&rsquo;s clearly a lie, so
            there&rsquo;s no need to keep pressing him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Don&rsquo;t get so cocky, or should I ask my dad to crush your
            parent&rsquo;s company, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He&rsquo;s showing off his father&rsquo;s power as if it was his own, and acting like
            some king.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you make a fool of Nogi-kun, it&rsquo;ll end really badly, you
            know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Nogi? That Nogi Medicine Manufacturing?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A powerholder who possesses a prominent track record even among the investors who
            came here today.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is stupid, but it&rsquo;s the truth that he holds real power.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It looks like he&rsquo;s greatly failed in raising his child, though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What does he need to do to satisfy you guys, then? What do you want from
            Fuji?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can see that the group of 3 including Nogi, Ryuuji, and Fuji all know each
            other.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kneel, kneel! If he kneels down and apologizes for lying, I&rsquo;ll forgive
            him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This really is stale. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t think Director Nogi is the kind of person who usually tries to force
            others to kneel, but if his child is saying these things, then it can&rsquo;t be helped that the surrounding
            people will suspect him to be so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Like I said, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not lying..!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Prove it, then. If you won&rsquo;t prove it, and if you won&rsquo;t kneel,
            then I&rsquo;ll beat you up, you know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Getting more and more annoyed, Nogi licked his lips with dissatisfaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s best if you just kneel already.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Ryuuji continued trying to get him to apologize, but Fuji shook his head
            sideways.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even while tearing up, he&rsquo;s insisting that he received the autograph.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This seems like the right time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t overlook children fighting, even if it has already started.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If it ends up becoming a bloodshed, Director Nogi&rsquo;s name will be
            blemished.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, a change in the situation suddenly occurred.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fuji isn&rsquo;t lying. That&rsquo;s what I think.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While it seemed like the answer was already decided, a 6th child showed up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even though all four children, including the non-hostile Ryuuji, decided that he was
            lying.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The appearance of the presence insisting that he was not lying, naturally, changed
            the atmosphere.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who the hell are you? I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but are you going to
            protect this kid?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s pointless for Fuji to insist on lying while
            surrounded by strong kids like you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The child insisted that it would be strange for Fuji to be stubborn like this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re friends or whatever, but you just want to
            protect him, right? It&rsquo;s obvious he&rsquo;s a liar.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to protect him for no reason. But, I just think that
            it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The child, confronting the 3 without fear.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What did you say!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, Fuji, I was occupied talking with my father.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ishigami-kun&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The child called Ishigami gently caressed the crying child&rsquo;s arm, and stood up
            against Nogi and the others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, something unexpected happened to this saviour here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry Ishigami, but I think Fuji is lying.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your basis for that? You don&rsquo;t know Fuji that well,
            Kanzaki-kun, do you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have no basis. But, there&rsquo;s no proof that it&rsquo;s real either. In
            which case, I can only decide by his demeanour.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Decide by his demeanour? Can you really make a clear decision in a situation
            like this, surrounding him and almost forcing him to admit that he&rsquo;s lying? You&rsquo;re just deciding
            based on the flow of the place.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, Nogi said so. That Kazuya doesn&rsquo;t normally give autographs. That he
            was the first.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, it is. Kazuya really said so when he gave me an autograph, you
            idiot.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, there&rsquo;s no proof that your story is true, is there?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha! Look at this, it&rsquo;s a two-shot that Kazuya and I took.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if he was waiting for this moment, Nogi showed the screen of his phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So? The date is two months ago. What about the possibility that Fuji got the
            autograph after that? It has nothing to do with that photograph, right? Maybe you wanted to spread around
            that you&rsquo;re being treated specially, and lied about it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He wanted to show off his evidence, but it seems like he made a gap to be taken
            advantage of.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying! I&rsquo;ll beat you up!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop, Ishigami. Why are you pointlessly objecting like that? Earlier, when you
            had a quarrel with me and the guys from the same class in cram school, you didn&rsquo;t even object, did
            you? If he just apologizes, this will all end peacefully.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I was the only one dragged into that. It would be
            annoying to worry about all the little things a few low-level opponents are saying. But if it&rsquo;s my
            friends in trouble, then it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">More and more, from the contents of this conversation, I can tell that Ishigami is an
            excellent child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That must be precisely why this child called Ryuuji can&rsquo;t help but snap at
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What does your dad do? He&rsquo;s bigger than mine, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is no place for me to bud in, of course, but Director Ishigami&rsquo;s company
            isn&rsquo;t really that large.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Our parents&rsquo; power has nothing to do with this, does it? How about your
            own abilities?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, his child is above the others in his education and talent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is it the result of excellent genes, or the fruit of good education?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna beat the shit out of you!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In a rage, Nogi greatly swung his right arm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait a bit.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">About to get hit, Ishigami stopped Nogi.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought he was going to apologize, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the
            case.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re going to hit someone, you should first grab them by the
            chest and make sure they can&rsquo;t run. If you clumsily swing into the empty air, you&rsquo;ll roll over
            in an uncool way, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The young man froze up with his fist squeezed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not proud of it, but I haven&rsquo;t ever been in a fight or
            anything. I bet I can&rsquo;t win against you. But I can run around. Which means, this&rsquo;ll end up with
            us running around yelling at each other here. As great as your father is, it will be very embarrassing for
            him. Right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The party venue is covered in laughter and elegant music is playing in high
            volume.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, if children start making noise, it will naturally stand out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So. If you&rsquo;re going to hit me, you should grab this area with your left
            hand first. They always do that first when hitting people in television and TV series too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After being guided, Nogi grabbed his collar with his left hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The other children also surrounded Ishigami so that he could not run away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do as you want!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Coming in close, Nogi threatened Ishigami.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, he raised his fist again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run away now!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You neither.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Right after saying so, Ishigami grabbed Nogi&rsquo;s arms back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So that Nogi could not let go of him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, he looked at an adult a bit farther away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He looked at me for a moment, but ignored me and called out to a different
            adult.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please help me! Someone, help!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wha-!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adults turning around to the screams all looked at Ishigami, who was caught by
            his collar.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Seeing him surrounded by 3 people and about to be struck, it doesn&rsquo;t matter
            which side is in the right or the wrong in this quarrel.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Nogi&rsquo;s name is powerful, but that naturally doesn&rsquo;t matter when
            it&rsquo;s about some silly fight between children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you doing!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Seeing the adults rushing towards them, Nogi quickly let go and started running like
            a scared rabbit. The crying Fuji, Ryuuji, and Ishigami were left behind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kanzaki-kun. You could have handled these guys, couldn&rsquo;t
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I hate trouble. Besides, this isn&rsquo;t a problem to solve by beating
            them up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying you should hit them. I&rsquo;m saying you should have
            solved it by talking. I know it&rsquo;s easier to just let them go. But it&rsquo;s also possible that there
            will be more unnecessary trouble if you don&rsquo;t do anything. Especially when you&rsquo;re facing people
            who try to use their parent&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He lied, though. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ryuuji asked what the truth was.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishigami didn&rsquo;t need to give an answer; Fuji&rsquo;s expression told the
            story.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sometimes you just want to lie through your teeth.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it&hellip; It&rsquo;s a pointless lie.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If Fuji was your friend, Kanzaki-kun, would you have helped him? Or would you
            have abandoned him all the same?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;At the very least, I&rsquo;ll help my friends when they&rsquo;re in trouble.
            No matter what I have to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that compared to the infantile, no, the children who act befitting of their
            age, Ryuuji and Ishigami can judge things very calmly. But their ways of thinking are very different.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Here, it looks like Ishigami handled things better, but it&rsquo;s true that he walks
            on a dangerous bridge.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he forced Fuji to admit his lie like Ryuuji and apologized, Nogi and the others
            would also have forgiven him at an early stage. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, he would have to know that he would be made fun of.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-sensei. I am very sorry I was late.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was finished observing the children, Sakayanagi walked up to me while slightly
            short of breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You came, Sakyanagi?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Of course. Even if we started with very different goals, there&rsquo;s no
            changing the fact that I respect you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After he said so, I shook hands with Sakayanagi whom I hadn&rsquo;t seen for a long
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While this is a person I should welcome, the children also seemed to be
            moving.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Good Evening, Kanzaki-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you just get here, Sakayanagi?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi. I&rsquo;ll be going now, Kanzaki-kun. See you at cram
            school.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You look very stern, but what happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ryuuji replied that nothing had happened, and left in a hurry like he was running
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your daughter has grown up a lot too since I haven&rsquo;t seen
            her.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s precocious in various ways, so there are a lot of things to worry
            about as a parent, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She seems to be intelligent, but it looks like she will keep her birth handicap for a
            long time after all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I did invite her to White Room once, but it was the right choice for her to
            refuse.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fundamental requirement in that facility is to be above average in every
            category.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a problem for you to be close to me, considering
            your position. But I&rsquo;m really grateful that you came. Please enjoy your time here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Thank you very much, Ayanokoji-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Smiling happily, Sakayanagi took his daughter to greet the others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I walked down to Ishigami, the boy who has been looking at me from a distance the
            whole time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Same for me. It looks like you were looking over here, but did you want
            something?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you notice?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was surprised that he even had time to look around in that situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want to ask you something. Why didn&#39;t you call out to me when you looked
            for help from the adults?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was aware that you had detected the call for help from Fuji early on, but
            you remained silent. I could get no assurance that you would be on our side.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no denying the possibility that if he had asked me for help and I had turned
            away, this child could have been beaten in the meantime.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kyo! I hope you didn&#39;t give Ayanokoji-sensei any trouble!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The one who appeared with the panicked voice of an adult was the chairman of the
            Ishigami Group.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I thought you were a very bright boy, but you are the son of Chairman Ishigami,
            aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishigami Gorou. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is now over 60 years old and still holds the position of chairman, but his power
            is still strong. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">He and his ex-wife had no children, but.... I guess he was blessed with this child
            when he remarried after his ex-wife&#39;s death.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Go have dinner over there.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood. Father.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lightly bowing his head, Chairman Ishigami&rsquo;s son left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Our Kyou really didn&rsquo;t give you any trouble, did he?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was rather impressed, actually.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright, then, but&hellip; He&rsquo;s old enough to be my
            grandson, so I feel uneasy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is very young and precious for him, so I can understand that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">More importantly however, what impressed me most is his calmness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You seem to be raising him well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In terms of his position, this man is highly superior to me, but his manners are soft
            and polite.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he grows up properly, that child will take over the Ishigami Group, and a solid
            generational change will be possible.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I suppose the only concern is his age.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the earliest, the child will be in his early twenties when he takes over. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If cautious, it will be when he crosses 30 years old. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">By then, Director Ishigami will also have crossed 80 years old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sensei, you intend on returning to the world of politics one day,
            yes?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, that is my intention.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Then, one day, will you put my son by your side?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your son&hellip; is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought it was only a joke, but I can&rsquo;t see any sign of falsehood in his
            expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. Because that child seems to be interested in the world of politics.
            Normally, not much catches his interest, but as his parent, I think I want to sympathize with his feelings
            as much as I can.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps preferring this to Kyou succeeding him, he laughed while wrinkling his
            cheeks.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If he still wants to enter the world of politics when he grows up, then I will
            gladly welcome him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This was just lip service, but I did feel a glimpse of talent from that child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, whether that is meant for politics or not is another issue.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.46r0co2"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">6</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There was about 30 minutes left in the three hour party.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Including my reunion with Sakayanagi, I was able to gather plenty of financing to
            keep operating.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I also learned that there are those awaiting my return to the world of
            politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-sensei! May I take just a little bit of your time!?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am so honoured that I was able to meet you! I am Kanzaki. Kanzaki Tokihiro
            from Kanzaki Engineering.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Director Kanzaki? The honour is all mine.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image14.webp" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I remember that when the White Room Project was launched and the story was passed on
            to some conglomerates, one of them was willing to make an offer to us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, because of the company&#39;s short history and weak ties to the political
            world, we ultimately rejected the offer for our own reasons, but two years later, without a sour look on
            their face, they once again offered us a small investment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is my son Ryuuji. Introduce yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;... I am Kanzaki Ryuuji.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The child quietly said hello while averting his eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I see, it&rsquo;s the child from earlier.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He seems like a bright kid.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I am proud of him. I want him to become both a literary and a martial master,
            so I have been teaching him everything I can with cram schools and private tutors, </span><span
            class="c35 c16 c11 c15">including karate and judo, of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c16 c11 c15 c35"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I had guessed that you were passionate about education, Director
            Kanzaki.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As for karate, his assistant instructor also praised him for having the talent
            to earn a black belt already at this time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wow. You seem to be raising him well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, if that is true, then there is something I need to ask him about.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I lightly asked the director for permission, and threw my words at Ryuuji.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;There is one thing I&rsquo;d like to ask, but why did you not try to save him
            in a concrete manner while watching that kid get bullied from up close earlier?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...That is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, the other party was above you in terms of numbers. However, from
            what I heard from Director Kanzaki, you seem to be excellent. Couldn&rsquo;t you have thought of a few
            methods?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I pretended not to know the turn of events, and asked him such a question.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying so, he awkwardly averted his eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed, you weren&rsquo;t the cause of the conflict. However, if you helped
            him out, he would have been in your debt. There is a possibility of that benefitting you in the
            future.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have the power to help, you can run away, or ignore it.
            However, only a fool doesn&rsquo;t use his power if he has it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t have any interest in this child, but I passionately spoke so and put my
            hand on his head.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Think and worry, and become a fine adult. Become an adult that can help
            people. Become someone that can support your father and take over the business one day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I preach to him like this before Director Kanzaki, it will be hard for him to be
            unkind to me and to pull his hand away from funding. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s nothing more important than pulling in some money, no matter the
            amount.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Umm, thank, you. &hellip;.I&rsquo;ll think a little about what I can
            do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">Perhaps moved by my words, he bowed with a happier expression than the stiff one he
            had up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.2lwamvv"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">7</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The party ended, and I sat down on a chair in the vacant room without hiding my
            exhausted figure.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Sorry I look like this. </span><span class="c35 c16 c11 c15">Things have been
            tense for me too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c35 c16 c11 c15"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do not worry. Rather, from how you look, have you not been sleeping properly
            these few days?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah&hellip; You noticed that too, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know you force yourself to work to your limit, Ayanokoji-sensei. Besides,
            White Room is currently in an existential crisis. I figured you were keeping up a calm appearance to the
            end, no matter what the situation ends up becoming. I deeply admire your psychological power,
            sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I lightly waved my hand to Sakayanagi, telling him to stop complimenting me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tell me the reason you came here. You didn&rsquo;t come to tell me words of
            appreciation again, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Talking things through with my father, he readily consented to me becoming a
            board chairman for the Advanced Nurturing High School.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh? So you&rsquo;re finally standing on the front stage too. After seeing all
            sides, what you decided on in the end was to succeed your father, huh? It lacks appeal as the final
            decision, but it is just like you, Sakayanagi. I shall congratulate you honestly.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much. It is thanks to you allowing me to study by your side for
            all these years.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">The fact that he doesn&rsquo;t look happy must have something to do with what we
            will talk about after this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now that it is revealed he will succeed his father, I don&rsquo;t even have to try to
            guess the reason.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If it becomes known that you have a relationship with a man like me, there
            will be a lot of problems for you as a board chairman for high education. This is a good time to cut off our
            ties.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We have different ways of thinking, but I value you highly, Ayanokoji-sensei.
            I was very surprised when you rose up against Naoe-sensei, but I could feel that your passion for White Room
            was certainly the real thing. That&rsquo;s precisely why&hellip; I do not regret having to distance myself
            from you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s a line that sets your teeth on edge, but it&rsquo;s an utterance with
            contents that I can say &ldquo;this is it, Sakayanagi&rdquo; to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am not obsessed with White Room. I&rsquo;m a have-not. Just, if I had not
            resisted Naoe, the only future that awaited me was one where everything would be taken away from me. Even if
            I was able to survive as a politician, I had no hope of success. Japan is too tied up by seniority by length
            of service. No matter how talented you are, if you are young, you fall through the screening process. If you
            try to force your way out, your fangs are cut off by the others&rsquo; power. But, if you look at the world,
            you can see it. It is becoming less and less rare for even people in their 20s to get into important
            positions. There are even those who stand at the top of the country in their 30s.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how much I try to push it down, the limitless ambition inside me is
            overflowing out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;How can we let these old fools with little life left stay in control of the
            political world? They don&rsquo;t even hold back from offering up the country&rsquo;s blood and meat just to
            protect themselves for 10 or 20 more years. Then, how will things be 30 or 40 years from now? We will be
            devoured by other countries, and the country of Japan won&rsquo;t even have its blood or skin

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I find someone competent, I will use them, no matter what kind of person they
            are.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, there will also be an abundance of ambitious people who will try to take
            advantage of me in my sleep, or people who will do things in the dark under someone else&#39;s orders, but
            if they are competent, I will use them as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Otherwise, the murky blood in the political world will not be replaced and will
            remain stagnant forever.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Fighting to protect one&#39;s own position does not do any good for the

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have my doubts about that, too. When you are in your 60s or 70s, you are
            finally qualified to be the leader of your country. I can understand why you might be doubtful about that

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if it is laughed at as a fantasy, I will prove that I can make this

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is a grand plan. It may take more than 10, or even 20 years.&rdquo;</span>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know. We may not be able to change everything in my generation, but I will
            need someone to take over White Room. It is also important to create &quot;educators&quot; who can create

            generation. My ambition has never waned. But&hellip; For someone who defied a big power holder once, coming
            back is almost impossible. As long as Naoe is in the Citizens Party, I will never have a seat
            there.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I heard that you were approached many times by the opposition

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You know the situation too, huh? I do have a grasp on a lot of opportunities.
            I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m a presence that the opposition party would do anything to gain. If I enter the
            party, however, I will simply be used. As long as the state of things doesn&rsquo;t change, all I can do is
            wait. That&rsquo;s when my fight will start. I have to save up the strength to be elected. By then, the
            people hindering me from above will have died, or have stepped back into hiding.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It really is a daunting prospect&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Precisely because I&rsquo;ve gathered a variety of experiences with both successes
            and failures, there is an unshakeable conviction inside me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is why I will not imitate other successful people.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Anyone can succeed by copying others who have succeeded.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What do I do, then? I won&rsquo;t do the same things that the people who do not
            succeed are doing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most of this world consists of people who do not succeed. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll look at them, and make sure not to make the same mistakes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is similar, but different. I think it&rsquo;s an extremely important point of
            focus to implement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pray for your health, Sakayanagi. Let&rsquo;s meet again some
            day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I exchanged a handshake with Sakayanagi, and said farewell for a while.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, after seeing him off at the entrance, I quietly gazed at the sleeping city

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In this word, there is a phrase called strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11 c39">[ TL Note 12 : &#21151;&#32618; Kouzai: merits and demerits; good points and bad
            points; strengths and weaknesses. In Jp text It&#39;s not really a phrase or idiom, it&#39;s actually one
            word but I said phrase because it has to be translated as more than one word. ]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The meaning is achievements and faults. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a useful phrase that includes both the bad and the good things.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This phrase is often used and is appropriate for many famous politicians.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They publicly succeed in various reforms, but fill their own pockets behind the
            scenes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The problem is, that the achievements and the faults are by no means evenly
            matched.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From the eyes of the others, 5 faults are a lot more important than 10
            achievements.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying it differently, this means that if you save 10 people but kill 5, it means you
            are the bad guy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So the public says.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Save 10 people, and don&rsquo;t let anyone be unhappy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you save 1000 people but bring misfortune to even one person, you are evil.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the psychology of the masses.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, there are some who say it differently.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He saved 1000 people, so you should ignore the few victims.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, there is one more trick here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Which is that the voices of the ones criticizing you are the loudest.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If 10% of the population raises voices of criticism, the media will gladly pick them
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, they will create the illusion that the whole country is criticizing you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Rather than praising someone, wanting to beat someone up catches the people&rsquo;s
            eyes a lot better.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Keep waiting. One day, I will surely stand at the summit of this
            country.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c4"></span></p>
