    <h3 class="c1" id="h.147n2zr"><span class="c9">Intro</span></h3>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Colour. Colour spreading through my view.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The first thing I took memory of was the colour white, equally spread over the
            surface.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just like how it was named &ldquo;White&rdquo; Room, this facility&rsquo;s underlying
            tone is white.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The ceiling is no exception to this either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My first memory was that I was there, staring up at the completely white
            ceiling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before I even showed interest in my fingers, I was only thinking about what this
            white ceiling was.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Every day, every day, I passed time just staring at that white ceiling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">First I cried, I cried because I was lonely, but I eventually learned that no one
            would come to save me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s how I think back on it now, this was not logic, but something I felt
            with my instincts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This was the first thing that I, a newborn who could not even speak words, learned by
            taking in his environment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After that, I noticed the existence of my fingers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All day I stared at my tiny fingers, held them in my mouth, licked them, and passed
            the time without doing anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Cold adults carried in the necessary nutrition for me to keep living.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This did not change even if I got sick.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Treatment was carried out indifferently and I returned to my normal daily
            life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No one hurried, no one worried, and no one delighted.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One day, I knew. That I was being raised here, politely, and at the same time,
            strictly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Human beings have feelings of joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, none of these emotions are of much use in this facility.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My yet undeveloped brain learned this at a very early stage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s understandable. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if I laughed, or cried, was angry or sad, the teachers never came to
            help.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The only time I could move forward was when I showed results.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is when I was two years old that I remember first understanding that words are
            words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There was a teacher sitting in front of me, and I was sitting across from him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With nothing else in between, the teacher was simply reaching out to me with open
            hands on both arms.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before long, the teacher put one small gummy into his right hand, making sure that I
            could see it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For the children who live in this facility, what we call snacks were extremely rare
            things.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This sweetness that I normally can&rsquo;t taste. I remember that I was no exception
            when little, and my desires were the same as everyone else&rsquo;s.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you can tell me which side the gummy is in, you can eat it.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adult then grasped the gummy in his right hand, and offered it out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">His face was stern, almost expressionless.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the other hand, the child he was facing - Ayanokoji Kyotaka, in other words, I,
            did not have feelings yet either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Both sides were without feeling, but, in contrast to the teacher consciously working,
            I was in my natural attitude.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, so were the other children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could sense that the other children also knew feelings would only shackle
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A one versus one of the adults hiding their feelings, and the children who have
            almost none.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you three chances to miss&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher, whispering so before me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could not yet understand the adults&rsquo; words and their structures.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Miss, chance, a two year old child has no way of comprehending either of these
            words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, he can sense by instinct what is being asked of him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He can sense what is being wanted from him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just as I saw with my eyes, I simply touched the right hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher opened his right hand without hesitation, and I could take one small
            gummy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Besides me at the same time, the other children were also working to get the
            gummy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All the teachers had grasped it in their right hands, and all of the children gave
            the correct answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This time, they took the gummy in their right hands, but quickly put it into their
            left hand instead right after.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, I touched the left hand without hesitation. Correct again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I repeated this simple work four more times after that, and was granted four gummies
            in total.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They weren&rsquo;t that sweet, but as rare candy in this White Room, they were
            popular with the children. I was no exception, and I remember that I loved the taste of this gummy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Round 5. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This time, the teacher put his arms behind him and offered up his hands after
            grasping the gummy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The force in his hands, and their positions were mostly the same.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher&rsquo;s expression did not change either, and I could not see anything
            different in his eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With this, there was no way of objectively identifying which hand the gummy was
            in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter which one you pick, it would be 1 in 2.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So, in this case, I will prioritize time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I touched one at random. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The right hand was empty. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The other children were spread between the two but their rate of picking the right
            hand was higher, though I&rsquo;m sure there was no reason for it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, after all, the teachers were all holding the gummy in their left hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher once again hid his hands behind himself, and offered them out after
            holding the gummy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wondered if they were going to continue with this simple 1 in 2.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no meaning to either choice, but maybe I should pick the left hand to
            make sure.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After thinking for a short moment, I decided to look around first instead of
            answering right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children were focused on the teacher and the gummy in front of them, and did not
            even glance anywhere else.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This time, most of the children picked the left hand, but the correct answer was
            right.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So, the possibility that the teacher before me is holding the gummy in his right hand
            is high.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I pointed at his right hand, he opened it just a little, and the green colored
            gummy showed itself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no being praised even if I get the right answer, but at least I can eat a
            gummy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While rolling the gummy around with the tip of my tongue, I focused again. The
            teacher held the gummy behind his back again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, he put his hands out at the same timing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, I looked around again this time too, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even though all the children had given their answers, the hands were not
            opening.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the last one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, they will not open their hands until all the answers are
            collected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As it was now completely a no-hint situation, I just pointed at the right
            hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, we all missed it. Both the children who pointed right, and the children who
            pointed left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At this time, a lot of children had missed for the third time, and became unable to
            gain another chance.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I also only had one last chance left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just like the past two times, he grasped the gummy with his hands behind his back.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could not think of any way to judge which hand it was in, and they didn&rsquo;t
            seem to be opening their hands even after the other children had given their answers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With this, there&rsquo;s no difference between picking right or left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That has to be true.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&hellip;Or&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My last one chance.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What if it isn&rsquo;t in either one of these..?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher didn&rsquo;t ask which hand the gummy was in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He only said to point where the gummy is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, maybe there is the possibility that the gummy is hidden somewhere
            other than his left or right hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Thinking with my infant brain, without touching either finger, I pointed at his
            back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He was just looking at me, without answering.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why did you point behind me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gummy, not, hands.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I answered in such a way, not able to perfectly control my words yet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Still silent, the teacher opened both hands at the same time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, I saw that there was a gummy being held in his right hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That was unlucky. The correct answer&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After answering so, the teacher put the small gummy into his own mouth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One of the remaining two children correctly answered right, and was given the
            gummy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Special for you, I&rsquo;ll give you one last chance.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He took one gummy, grasped one with his hands behind his back as if repeating the
            same thing, and put them out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought that his hands behind him were empty, but it was actually in his right
            hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So, was it just a 1 in 2 chance, without hiding it from the start?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Or, did he estimate that I would think so after he hid it two times, and purposefully
            grasped one? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Isn&rsquo;t the possibility that he actually has one higher than the possibility that
            both his hands are empty? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The remaining child pointed left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wonder what I should do&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Left, right, or hidden behind his back?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Behind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After thinking about it, I gambled. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I threw away the right and left hands, and judged that both were empty.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher opened both hands. There was a gummy in his left hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That was unlucky. You missed again. Are you frustrated?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is true that I am disappointed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I nodded slightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s not because I wanted a gummy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was frustration against my own idea not working.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He is different after all, this child.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adults who had gathered besides me were muttering to each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I could not comprehend complicated words at 2 years old, I only remember that time
            in enumerations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All the children other than Kiyotaka only earnestly picked right or left.
            However, Kiyotaka observed the choices in his surroundings, and was even conscious of the third choice of
            the gummy being hidden. Further, even after it was clear that the gummy was not hidden, he still did not
            abandon the idea that it could be hidden. These aren&rsquo;t the thoughts of a 2 year old
            infant.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re thinking too much about it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, in all of the other tests until now too, this child&rsquo;s way of
            thinking and viewpoints have been different.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Inside the thoughts that I could not comprehend, I etched the teacher&rsquo;s words
            into memory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I may get some hints from this conversation after this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I have grown to be bigger one day, I can just open this drawer and do what I
            have to do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...It&rsquo;s creepy how he&rsquo;s looking at us. Like he can understand what
            we&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Impossible&hellip; He&rsquo;s 2 years old, you know. There&rsquo;s no way he
            comprehends any words other than the minimum necessary ones.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The buzzer rang, and the announcement for the test&rsquo;s ending echoed through the
            room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adults looked at each other, ordered the children to stay as they were and left
            the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">None of the children cried, but instead looked on at the familiar scene.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No one asked for help.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because, by 2 years old, this was already drilled into our flesh and bone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.3o7alnk"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Another remnant of the memories I&rsquo;ve dug up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sometimes, I remember these while doing the work to erase unnecessary
            memories.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sit down and say your name.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Say your name.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My brain received this instruction, and a transmission from my brain towards my
            throat occurred.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s my code. My enumeration.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An important factor to differentiate human beings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All of us White Room students have learned our names as a way to differentiate each
            individual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, we were not given our surnames as infants, and the teachers all called us by
            name.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There was no reason to know it at the time, but, learning our surnames would give
            birth to inconvenience. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was obvious that they were anxious about the possibility of us connecting to our
            specific identity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At around 4 years old, new curriculums started being put to practice one by
            one.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The learning test will be conducted now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The thing representing this would be the written test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Everyone corrected their postures, and faced the test paper.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">The letters were composed of five categories: Hiragana, katakana, </span><span
            class="c36 c11">alphabet</span><span class="c2">, numbers, and simple kanji.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">[ TL Note 9 : It just says &quot;alphabet&quot; here. But in Jp text it would be
            referring to the latin alphabet. ] </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We have already been taught how to write in the period of one year after 3 years old,
            so there is no hesitation in my fingers holding and moving the pen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I don&rsquo;t get a specific result within the time limit, I will be
            punished.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the same time, they will also check how good our handwriting is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There will be no points added for well written letters, but points will be subtracted
            if I panic and write badly, so caution is necessary. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No one in this facility questions whether or not we can solve the problems we
            face.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you ask why, the only answer will be that because everyone can do it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The ones who cannot are eliminated at 3 years old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our group, which they call the fourth term students, was at first 74 people in
            total.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, as mentioned before, the children who were unsuccessful have already dropped
            out at 3 years old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because of that, we are currently 61 people, but, except for sleeping time,
            we&rsquo;re spending most of our time together.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The written test was 30 minutes, but the contents were such that if you solved the
            problems without hesitation, only a time of half a minute to 3 minutes was necessary.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the same for all the written tests that have been conducted in White
            Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Solve the problems, and move to the next one. Find the answer and write it
            down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the same time, I&rsquo;m checking if the problem I solved before was
            correct.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After writing everything down, I raised my right hand right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After signaling that I&rsquo;m done, I turned the paper around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Getting a full score is the minimum requirement in the written tests. Both good
            writing and speed is required.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the 7th written test since we&rsquo;ve become 4 years old, and I&rsquo;ve
            been getting first place for 4 times in a row. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">24th place in the first written test, 15th in the second one, 7th place in the third
            one; I wasn&rsquo;t at the top right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I used the time to understand the structure of the written tests and get a grasp on
            the logic and optimization needed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After unraveling the mystery once, I never lost it again and I&rsquo;ve certainly
            polished myself further.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The difference between me and the second place has been widening each time the
            written test was conducted, and it got up to around 5 minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if I get a full score, even if I finish in first place, no one would praise
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After everyone cleared the test, we moved to the next curriculum.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now, we will be conducting judo. Everyone, change your clothes and follow the
            teacher to another room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Wrestling. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Like the written tests, this was also added with the curriculum when we were 4 years
            old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s already been 4 months since I&rsquo;ve learned judo.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the basics were hammered into me, I progressed to the point of being able to do
            randori in real fights.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">[ TL Note 10 : Randori; free-style judo training. ]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Haa!!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My field of vision swayed, and a sharp pain ran through my back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In confrontations with the teachers, the children were always made to suffer
            hardship.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, I&rsquo;m no exception to this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Beaten into the ground without mercy, unable to breathe; but they won&rsquo;t let me
            rest.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I don&rsquo;t get up instantly, thick arms will fly at me again along with a
            scolding.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was beaten into the ground again and tried to defend myself, but the damage was too
            much to breathe through.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was pinned down on the ground, the same thing was being repeated all around
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children were all writhing in pain while crying or sobbing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&hellip; I can&rsquo;t stand up any more&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if asking for mercy, Mikuru weakly clinged to the teacher&rsquo;s
            legs.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Get up anyway!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Her arms were forcefully pushed out and he demanded her to stand up, but her body
            doesn&rsquo;t seem like it can move.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fact that she is a woman will not in the least be taken into consideration in
            this place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you to get up!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mikuru, being kicked around on the floor and spitting out vomit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, the adult isn&rsquo;t actually kicking her seriously.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even so, it is obvious to anyone looking that the force is unbelievably
            strong.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t show mercy, even to a kid! You should know that by
            now!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A normal mind would have a strong resistance to hurting a child to this
            degree.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the teachers who were called to this White Room were not normal.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They are the kind of people who would not even resist sending women and children to
            the brink of death.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No matter how many of you disappear, no one will cry for you! Stand up on your
            own and come at me!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mikuru, convulsing and unable to focus, tried to stand up by pushing herself with
            both hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! That&rsquo;s right! Show me your spirit!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, uuh&hellip; uhh&hellip; uh..!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, perhaps because the kick from earlier was a critical one, Mikuru collapsed
            and lost consciousness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tsch! A coward, huh? Carry her away right now! She&rsquo;s a
            hindrance!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher stepped around angrily, and yelled out while forcefully eliminating
            Mikuru.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure one would think this is a pitiful scene.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In which case, they should rethink things.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is only the start.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The excessive reactions like Mikuru&#39;s are fading away day by day, and even her
            expression towards pain is fading away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even human instinct is being eliminated as an unnecessary function.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is natural to be thrown around. It is natural to have difficulty breathing.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is natural to be in so much pain that you can&rsquo;t help but weep. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, even thinking about all of this is a waste of resources.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The only way out of the situation is to try and reduce the number of times that we
            can be thrown around within the time limit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, the most ideal option is to defeat your opponent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the opponent&rsquo;s strength, body structure and technique are all
            overwhelmingly superior.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no need to say that it is no simple thing to close the difference between an
            adult and a child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Everyone stood up, battered and bruised, after being forced to fight hard and without
            breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After receiving the strict training of the teachers, at the end of the day, we have
            an obligation to conduct randori with three people.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have learned that any prey that looks like he has weakened is destined to be hunted
            down by the strong.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My total record is 144 battles. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">127 victories and 17 defeats. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, currently, I have 64 victories in a row.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our opponents are on a rotation unrelated to gender, and this time Shirou silently
            stood before me, preparing his stance while waiting for the starting signal.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Shirou has an overwhelmingly positive record with 135 victories and 9 defeats.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I faced him two times until now, with 1 victory and 1 defeat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I lost at our first randori, and haven&rsquo;t lost since after the rotation came
            around again, but he has the most skill in judo among the other students.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Precisely because this is a strong foe that I cannot be lenient against, my
            sensibilities are sharpened even further.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Shirou is always aggressive and takes the initiative in his fights with others, but
            today, his third fight, he took a wait-and-see stance and seemed to be aiming for a counter-attack.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I welcomed this, as I want to increase my attacking experience facing a strong
            opponent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Begin!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Along with the teacher&rsquo;s voice, we started our struggle and fought to the
            bitter end with defeat on our backs.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Win or lose, we will move to the next curriculum as if nothing happened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Karate is the martial arts that started a little later.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Here, the students take more blows from the teachers compared to judo.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure the variety of martial arts will increase as we become 5 or 6 years
            old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There was a common awareness of this among all the children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.23ckvvd"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">2</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At around 5 years old, the number of children decreased further, and we suddenly
            became 50 people in total.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No one cared. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We have no leeway to do so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Here, the only thing required of us is our own abilities.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, even if there is, it is far, far away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you stop moving once, you can&rsquo;t catch up again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One would think this is unusual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For me, this is what&rsquo;s usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A dinner, some time after our numbers had decreased by quite a lot.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The dinner is progressing with all of us gathered together. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">During the dinner, the teachers left, and the children were left alone with each
            other. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, no one directly conversed, not even once.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is so much that I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone&rsquo;s voice without a teacher
            between us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why don&rsquo;t they talk?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not like the teachers are forbidding it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s just that there is no need for conversation, so it isn&rsquo;t
            happening.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We know each other&rsquo;s names through the teachers, and we also know how well
            everyone can study, and each person&rsquo;s athletic ability. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All of our inner abilities are clearly visible.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Fundamentally, there aren&rsquo;t any foods I like or don&rsquo;t like.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The rule of eating anything that is handed out to you doesn&rsquo;t change for
            anyone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, there is no need to converse about the meal either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is also no awareness of us being students learning side by side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A presence that doesn&rsquo;t help or hinder you simply becomes the surrounding
            scenery.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could hear a girl with the name Yuki, who always sits before me, muttering so with
            a tiny voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Private conversations during dinners are not forbidden, so this doesn&rsquo;t count
            as problematic conduct.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s just that no one feels the need to talk with each other, so they
            don&rsquo;t.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In this situation, this is the first change.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought she would give up speaking after no one replied or reacted, but Yuki
            didn&rsquo;t do that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kiyotaka, do you like it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Facing me in front of her, she asked if I like or dislike carrots.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Should I reply, or should I not?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I&rsquo;ve never held any feelings of liking or disliking carrots in the
            first place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t see it as anything but a type of nutrition that human beings should
            consume.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Beta carotenes make up the majority of the nutrition in carrots.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Its function is to turn into Vitamin A after being taken into your body.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It protects your cells against aging, and maintains the health of skin and mucous
            membranes. It&rsquo;s also very important for protecting against viruses, and-</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you like carrots, or do you dislike them?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like them either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The one who answered wasn&rsquo;t the person she asked, but Shirou sitting to my
            left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps surprised by this, this time Yuki quickly moved her gaze.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While having my attention drawn by the two&rsquo;s conversation, I checked the
            security camera.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even this dinner is, obviously, being watched by the teachers every day. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re picking up sounds and voices too. Seeing as there is no
            reproach or reaction, it seems that conversations like these are allowed after all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, we haven&rsquo;t even once been encouraged to have conversations like
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as there is no merit to having a conversation, there is no need for me to
            react to the two.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Do I like carrots, or dislike them?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The answer was that I don&rsquo;t hate them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After dinner, I&rsquo;m always a bit lost. Because I don&rsquo;t know how to kill
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As it was the most comfortable thing to do, my best choice was to simply sit and
            wait.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it seemed to be different for Yuki, as she was walking around the room by
            herself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought it was a waste of energy to walk around, but I just watched in
            silence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was when she was right in front of my eyes after walking around the cramped room
            three times.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki was about to fall down in front of me as if she had tripped.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I instantly offered my hand, and stopped her from collapsing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird to fall down when there&rsquo;s no reason to,
            huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After I said so as I analyzed the situation, Yuki was surprised with wide open
            eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Or, are you too exhausted? No&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t look like it,
            though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could not understand why she tripped over.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, it seems that it was the same for Yuki.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mhm. I don&rsquo;t know why I tripped even though I&rsquo;m not even tired.
            It&rsquo;s a bit weird, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After saying so, she showed me an expression that I had never seen before.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image9.jpg" title=""></span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The mimetic muscles on her cheeks, her orbicularis oculi muscle&#8203;s, and the
            wrinkling muscles near her eyebrows created a new expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I haven&rsquo;t ever seen it from the students learning along with me, nor from the
            teachers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seemed that the fact that I found this curious was also conveyed to this
            girl.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;? Just now, I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can perceive an expression of confusion and embarrassment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s only natural.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I haven&rsquo;t learned of such a thing. No one taught me about such
            expressions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I do know about them as information.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It didn&rsquo;t take long to learn that this was a &ldquo;smile&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Something that human beings possess as an instinct after being born, no, maybe even
            before birth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps that&rsquo;s exactly why she can do this without having been taught
            how.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.ihv636"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">3</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The rules the children are taught in order to survive this world are not that
            many.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, there are a few strict rules.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That did not change, even after I became 5 years old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">7 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to wake up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Along with the guidance of the featureless mechanical voice, the timer rang without
            even one second of a delay, and I began waking up in my small personal room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before I got up, a staff member came in and removed the attached electrodes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After I got up, he quickly performed a health check.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t fidget, and my everyday life spread before my eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After checking if there was no change in my height or weight, I finished my business
            in the toilet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Urinalysis is done once a month and a small amount of blood is drawn at the same
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After the inspections ended, the staff member left without even greeting me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After that, I rehydrated and warmed myself up with 30 minutes of basic
            training.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After keeping daily physical records such as grip strength, everyone went to the
            training area at the same time, and we performed our assignments divided by gender. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The possibility of wondering what will happen if you don&rsquo;t complete your
            assignment, does not exist.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you ask why, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s already decided that everyone will
            complete their assignments.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Those who cannot keep to this will not be stepping into this room tomorrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This series of processes ends towards 8 a.m.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Nutrition being an important point in breakfast, compared to when we were little, it
            has become more efficient with vitamins and block nutritional meals and such.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Does it taste good, or not?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Do I like it, or dislike it?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This still doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">You eat what you are given in the order that they are given.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only, and only that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After the meal ends, the day&rsquo;s curriculum starts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With language and mathematics as the beginning, we started studying a lot more
            subjects such as economic studies and political studies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is repeated until noon with small breaks in between.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At lunch, we eat a similar menu to dinner, and the curriculum starts again in the
            afternoon.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After continuing to study before a table until 5 p.m, the physical education
            starts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Everything ends at 7 p.m.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Until now, we haven&rsquo;t spoken out of our volition even one word.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After finishing lunch and bathing, it&rsquo;s 9 p.m. when the physical examination
            ends.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Here, for the first time, something called a meeting where you speak about the day
            was set up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Conversation in the tiny space with no teachers and only children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it isn&rsquo;t as if we can talk about any theme we want.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">How did you feel about today&rsquo;s studies, and how did you deal with them?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This time is for organizing and scrutinizing such things from the side of the
            learners.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as the adults don&rsquo;t hear anything they consider unnecessary
            conversation, they won&rsquo;t intervene.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Regardless of whether it is beneficial or not, as long as you maintain the rules,
            this is a time you can stay silent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s about 30 minutes, but I always simply listened in and never felt like
            talking to myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if we are allowed to speak between just the children, the adults are
            fundamentally always listening in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am certain that even these conversations are a part of the curriculum.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it isn&rsquo;t as if we are given a specific assignment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the same time, perhaps this is also to hear what the children are really
            thinking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If they clumsily set up an assignment, it will naturally become a conversation just
            for that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Towards 9:30 p.m., we are all returned to our personal rooms.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We are obliged to go to the toilet and be laying on the bed by 10
            o&rsquo;clock.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Electrodes are put in, and lights out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The medical check is never skipped.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">365 days, no matter what kind of day it was, time is set aside to confirm the
            situation after that day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With that, the day ends.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our educational policy, from waking up to going to sleep.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One day in the White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A world that doesn&rsquo;t change in the entire year.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.32hioqz"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">4</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Once every few years or months, sometimes, a big change happens.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is when, among the children, numerous students who cannot keep up with the
            curriculum begin to become visible.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the studying increases in difficulty by 2 or 3 stages, they begin falling
            behind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was clear that even if we all studied the same amount of time, there are
            differences between individuals.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The first time we learned addition.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The first time we learned multiplication.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We should have started on equal grounds, but excellence shows itself before
            long.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">You can somehow manage to move to the next step on the way, but the children who
            stand out by falling behind too much trip on the next step after that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am sure it isn&rsquo;t as if the adults welcome the children dropping out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, they cannot keep allowing a child to stay in the same place as the others if
            they can&rsquo;t keep up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There will be dissonance if the children who cannot keep up are left alone, but if
            the other children were made to fit with the children who cannot keep up, then the children who are in the
            front will have their rhythm broken.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They&rsquo;ll lose their next chance to learn.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s precisely why the work of &ldquo;culling&rdquo; the children is
            necessary.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;10 minutes left.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before conducting the culling, there is a special high difficulty writing curriculum
            in the periodical learning ability test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I noticed something while repeatedly studying every day. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fact that this special written test&#39;s difficulty increases in accordance with
            the top grades from the previous tests. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, when you get a full grade, you move the standard of the whole test up
            for everyone and, next time, it becomes even more difficult for the children who got low grades.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Conversely, if the top students&#39; grades are lower than a perfect score, it will
            lower the ceiling for everyone else.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how hard the problems are, excuses such as making a tiny miscalculation or
            a careless miss won&#39;t be accepted.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why the children repeatedly check their own answers even after solving
            everything within the time limit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because it will all end if there is a hole somewhere, they desperately consume the
            test paper.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Leaving aside such busy things, I simply continued staring at the front with a pen in
            my hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I continued pretending to challenge the test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am not worried about even the slight chance that I may have written something down
            wrongly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As for the reason, it is because I don&rsquo;t make such mistakes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The questions on the test paper and the written answers are imprinted word for word
            in my head.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;5 minutes left.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With the announcement, the sound of the writing around me became more intense.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps in an impatient state of mind, I can hear the sound of the pressure from the
            eraser by my side getting stronger.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This test is numerous stages higher in difficulty than the last one.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">During math time, when we were solving problems about the equality conditions
            arithmetic means, geometric means and such, something strange happened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had almost half of the 30 minutes left to write the final problem, and had only
            been staring at the front of the room for the remaining time, waiting for the ending signal.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suddenly a man, a representative of White Room, entered the room with a grim look on
            his face. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not the first time an adult has shown up in the middle of a test.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This happens in cases such as there&rsquo;s someone who couldn&rsquo;t keep up with
            the test and hyperventilated or collapsed, or there&rsquo;s someone having spasms or convulsions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Right now, I don&rsquo;t sense any children like that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Very rarely, someone may have recklessly cheated, being too preoccupied with solving
            the problem.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I learned quickly that the objective was no one else but me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He stopped a bit in front of me to my left, looked at my test paper, and quickly
            looked over to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Since my name was called, I looked up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Remember this well. One who possesses power but does not use it is only a
            fool.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As for what I had done, it&rsquo;s as if it was already obvious.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Leave the room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After being ordered so, I followed the man and left the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it? You understand the intent behind my question, don&rsquo;t
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was made to sit down in the small room I was led into.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Looks like you solved all the problems, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you sure that you will get a perfect grade?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The test&rsquo;s problems are purposefully restrained to 80 points.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why did you cut corners?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been instructed to cut corners.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if I don&rsquo;t have a perfect grade in this test, I know that I will not be
            dropped out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you aware that you are already driving the front of this
            period?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, there can only be one reason that you cut corners.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After saying so, the man pointed at me and answered like this:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is it because you noticed the structuring of this curriculum? If you get a
            full grade, the 4th period students&rsquo; special curriculum will increase in difficulty. Naturally, the
            number of dropouts will increase. Did you want to stop that from happening?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That answer is correct.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is there actually some sense of comradery growing inside you towards those
            children?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I see, so this is the conclusion that the adults came to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did it look like that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, it did.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How did you feel about that, Ayanokoji-sensei?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am interested in the answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Cutting corners to help your comrades or such, is not going to help anyone at
            all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am sure that it is indeed so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll ask myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll deny.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then try arguing me down.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Being ordered to do so, I put my own thoughts into words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In the first place, I have never seen the children around me as
            comrades.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you try to get a perfect grade?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The teachers already estimated that I would get a perfect grade. So, there is
            no need to write it down on paper each time. It&rsquo;s more time-efficient to finish it with an empty
            paper.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Using your power when not needed, is precisely nothing more than a waste of
            resources.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a presumption. Knowledge thins out with time. That&rsquo;s why
            you keep doing your best to not forget. Even if you have the ability to get a perfect grade, there can be
            errors in your memory or mistakes. It is necessary for you to keep aiming for the highest
            condition.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is not wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You stated that very definitively, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Besides, the reason that I cut corners is different.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know that if I don&rsquo;t cut corners, the percentage of children who drop
            out will greatly increase compared to now. In other words, if I cut corners, the world changes into one
            where the children who were supposed to drop out still exist.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a feeling of
            fellowship.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is wrong. I thought that I would lose my chance to be in contact with the
            children who will drop out, and lose out on experience.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teachers looked at each other with puzzled expressions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My brain, seeking knowledge, is looking for answers by analyzing any pattern
            possible.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is simple to throw them away at this stage. However, I am still in the
            learning stage. I want to learn the things that only the weak can see, that only the weak can
            feel.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you saying that it&rsquo;s too early to make them drop out
            now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I nodded. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before long, most of the children around me will become unable to keep up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you intend on earning knowledge, and standing above us? You&rsquo;re not
            the one to decide that. We&rsquo;re the ones who make the choice on who is adopted or
            rejected.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. Everything is determined by the state of the White
            Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if this man tries to squash me with logic, it&rsquo;s useless.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The only thing that matters is that the only choice I had was to cut corners.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Still, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not simple to accept this decision.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if I get 0 points, the ones who will judge if I cut corners in the end are a
            third party, the teachers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I won&rsquo;t be disqualified with that. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Still, it is only natural that they can&rsquo;t obsessively treat someone who got 0
            points like someone who got 100.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this okay? If this is how he thinks, maybe we should see how
            everything goes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you think, Suzukake?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I agree with Ishida-san. If he is doing something we haven&rsquo;t even
            thought of, then that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After the men fell silent for a while, he dropped his gaze over to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do whatever you want. Just make sure you don&rsquo;t forget what I
            said.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That those who don&rsquo;t use the power they have are fools.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Leaving aside the question of if that is reality or not, this was the moment that I
            decided to memorize it as something of interest.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yet at the same time, a different emotion peeked from my face.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is, the fact that I began to feel that I don&rsquo;t like this man.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now, I could understand Yuki&rsquo;s feelings a little from when she said she
            disliked carrots.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I was returned to the room and took my seat, the buzzer rang.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the same time, the children all put the pens they were holding down onto the
            table.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is the rule, the regulation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, only one of the sounds of a pen scratching and writing on the paper had not
            disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This isn&rsquo;t rare either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One young boy, continuing the test while breathing heavily and sobbing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even after the automatic door opened and the adults came in, there was no change in
            the fact that he looked to be continuing the test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">His right arm was forcefully grasped.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! Let go! No! I can, I can still solve them! I can solve them! W-waah, waah!
            I don&rsquo;t wanna drop out!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Realizing his own defeat on top of the extreme pressure, he scattered his gastric
            juices on top of the test paper.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The gastric juices stuck to his clothes from the nape of his neck, but the adults
            restrained him from both sides without paying attention to it, and pulled the resisting child out of the
            room. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children have lost their feelings, but the time of the tests alone is an
            exception. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a case of losing your reasoning as your instincts get awakened with death
            before your eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Some looked towards him, but most of the children are looking ahead without taking
            any action.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Waaaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The cries that I had never heard the likes of until now echoed, and moved to the
            other side of the automatic door.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When he was taken out, the door quickly closed and silence returned.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He really doesn&rsquo;t know anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That no matter how many points you get in this special curriculum, you won&rsquo;t be
            dropped out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you can&rsquo;t even distinguish that difference, it can&rsquo;t be helped that
            you&rsquo;ll drop out here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.1hmsyys"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">5</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Fundamentally, there were no feelings of liking or disliking inside me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Not just with food, but also with the curriculums.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I respected the traditional culture such as music related things like piano and
            violin, calligraphy, and tea ceremony.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I spent the days just challenging the subject before me, but among that, there was
            one thing that I was not very into.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The curriculum was newly introduced when I was 6 years old; it was a lesson that was
            conducted once or twice every month for half a day. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was a study named &ldquo;travel&rdquo;, which used a virtual console.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Standing up, all the children put on large goggles.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The screen quickly lit up and the program appeared, then, a while later, it
            started.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been learning about America overseas with places such as New York
            and Hawaii, but this time we will conduct the curriculum at the center of Japan. First, we&rsquo;ll start
            with basic public transportation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The basic premise of the study. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fact that this world is not just the White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At this time, we are quickly told that it is still time for us to learn, and that the
            children cannot leave this place until they become adults.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The virtual console reproduces the same scenery as in real life in 360 degrees with a
            quality that could be mistaken for the real thing, and the visuals are accompanied by sound, creating a
            sense of realism. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even the people passing in the scenery of the city are recreated, such as a
            salary-man in a suit, an old man with a cane, or an old woman trying to get into a taxi.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, there are also the figures of children, but unlike the real outside world,
            you can&rsquo;t see them playing around and having fun, and instead they&rsquo;re just mechanically moving
            around like machines.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In this place, we learn about history and the structure of the world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In order to adapt to the world without any problems when we leave into the outside
            world one day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know that it is necessary, but I think there are problems with this method of
            learning.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One of the reasons that I am not enthusiastic about this is that there is something
            unpleasant about this which I can&rsquo;t put into words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Something that is commonly described as &ldquo;3D sickness&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The possibility has been raised that an imbalance between visual perception and
            perception by the semicircular canals may cause the brain to falsely believe that it is seeing a
            hallucination.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no way to stop the sickness on an individual basis; the only way would be to
            let the brain learn over time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It wasn&#39;t so hard that it was impossible to continue, but this is the reason I
            could never like it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, this virtual console is not only used as a visual device to perceive the
            outside world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was also used as a tool to develop our observation and insight.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We were asked to spot unnatural points in the story as it unfolded in various
            locations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If the point was wrong, or if we could not find the unnatural point itself, the
            instructors would mercilessly instruct the students.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The method of this instruction varied, but it was mainly something that caused pain
            to the person.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s precisely why we observed with bloodshot eyes, trying not to even
            blink.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With the danger to our life we feel sharpening our senses, we can see things that we
            could not before.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was walking through Tokyo City with the virtual console, the screen was suddenly
            covered in darkness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The voices of the teachers reaching my ears also stopped, and everything fell
            silent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Everyone take your goggles off.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Hearing the voice not coming from a microphone, but from inside the room, we all
            obeyed the instruction at once.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is a technical problem. This will be it for the virtual console today.
            There is around 30 minutes until the next curriculum, so you can keep waiting here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Along with that instruction, all the goggles in our hands were collected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, huh..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It looks like most of the children intended on killing time while standing
            still.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that the technical problem cannot be solved right away, so the teachers
            decided to move onto another curriculum.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children were, of course, immediately lined up and changed their minds towards
            the next process.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will start reading names. The ones whose name was called will follow the
            teacher and move.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Along with this instruction, three names were called at the start.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the end, I was the last one to be called. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I obeyed, the instructor slowly walked and invited me into my personal
            room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A one on one with the instructor without any other children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There was only a table and two folding chairs at the center of the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sit down, now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t as if I had stopped, but the instructor said so while hitting the
            table and ordered me to take my seat right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I sat before the instructor, he spread five cards that were in his hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There were different marks on each of them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From left, it&rsquo;s circle, square, cross, star, and wave.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will show you what I&rsquo;m going to make you do after this. Make sure you
            observe well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The instructor and I faced each other, and the side who had the lead turned all the
            cards around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The five cards had the same pattern on the backs, so in this situation, it is
            impossible to tell which card has which mark.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I suppose I am to guess a specific card from among these.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what I thought, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The five cards, rearranged.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will give you 10 seconds at one time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Square.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying so, the instructor turned over the card on the leftern end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was a star.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He missed, but the instructor continued with saying marks and turning over
            cards.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Circle, star, cross, wave&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From the second card to the fifth one, wave, square, cross, circle.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only the fourth one, cross, was correct. In other words, the correct answer rate was
            20%.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is the cycle, which we will repeat 10 times. Look
            carefully.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">5 guesses, 10 times. In other words, 50 in total.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They calmly kept repeating the same thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the end, the correct answer ratio was 15 from 50; 30%.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn now, Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher who was the answerer stood up from his seat and I sat down in his
            place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wonder what the objective of this practice is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not to trigger a superpower or something.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying it differently, is it to train our intuition?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, it&rsquo;s hard to think of this as a legitimate and realistic training for
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The instructor mixed five cards.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He uses an overhand shuffle to mix the cards each time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is this just a habit, or is it intentional?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is impossible to determine, but it is easy to dismiss it as meaningless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If it does have a meaning, I wonder what it is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The material of the table makes it seem smoother and easier to do a wash shuffle
            while on the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is he using an overhand shuffle on purpose?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Another thing that bothers me is that when the instructor arranges the cards, they
            are not always arranged from the same position.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sometimes he lines them up from the left end, sometimes he starts in the middle, then
            the right end, then the left end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t think there was any kind of law as far as I could tell from the 10 times
            I saw it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&#39;t just dismiss this as a habit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the back side of the cards, even if you stare at them closely, you can&#39;t feel
            any difference.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, I don&#39;t think either the instructor or I could tell the
            difference.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, there is a big difference between me and the instructor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is, whether or not we can touch the cards or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When mixing, distributing, and flipping the cards, the instructor is the only one who
            does all the work.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What if... He doesn&#39;t want me to touch them?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It has to be because the teacher can see the answer on the cards, even though he
            shouldn&rsquo;t be able to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yet, even if he can see it, I still can&#39;t see it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am not forbidden to reach out and touch it, but is that the right answer?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At this point, it is clear that this is not just an exercise in intuition.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, a possible rule I can think of is&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Five cards are laid out and the 10 second count begins.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In order to increase the percentage of correct answers by even 1%, I decided on the
            first mark to utter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Star.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I answered, the instructor flipped the leftmost card with an unchanging
            expression on his face.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The &quot;star&quot; appeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&#39;s still only 1 in 5.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Wave, square, cross, circle.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The instructor flipped the cards from the second to the fifth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The marks I said were turned over as the correct ones.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;There&#39;s still 9 times left.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With the recent correct answers, I am convinced of one rule.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, the rest is easy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">9 more times. I correctly guessed 45 more cards in total.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Correct answer ratio is, 100%.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As he finished collecting the last card, the teacher stared at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In those eyes, was hidden a feeling that shouldn&rsquo;t have been there until just
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I never thought you would hit the mark after just one time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The teacher who showed the practice to me at first. If it&rsquo;s just the
            explanation of the rules, repeating the same thing just one or two times would have been enough.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is to say, it wasn&rsquo;t a simple explanation of the rules.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They purposefully hid that it was a test of memory strength, and tested how quickly I
            would notice this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Still, this perfect memory strength is a little hard to
            believe&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you memorize them too? They were all lined up in the same way as
            the first time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Impossible. The only thing I memorized were the 5 small chips on the cards
            that could not be seen with the eyes. The reason I could line them up in the same way as the first one is
            because I received instructions from an intercom set up in my year.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why there was a camera on the ceiling, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...You noticed that too?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It looked like it was being hidden, which I felt was strange.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I entered the room, he called out to me in order to focus my gaze on one
            point.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, it was also unnatural how he rushed me to sit down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If for some reason they wanted the curriculum to progress quickly, they would have
            been in a hurry even before I entered the room, and the practice they showed me should have been done
            faster.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the first one who passed this curriculum in one try&hellip; You
            can go back.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will take my leave.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Thinking of this as a change from the virtual console curriculum which I don&rsquo;t
            like much, I can say that this curriculum today was much more fun.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.41mghml"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">6</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are many exclusive special rooms in the White Room for the various
            curriculums.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Among those, there is a warm water pool where we can swim in through the entire
            year.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Swimming is thought to be very important for training your physical
            capabilities.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For the children whose bodies are not completely developed yet, swimming is a perfect
            fit with its low load on the body. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, the time we spent in the water was very important for the children to
            release stress too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The lessons took two hours at a time, with 10 minute rests after every 50
            minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, there was 30 minutes for serious competitive swimming with competitions and
            target times.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After that was over, the children were given 30 minutes of free time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We could either relax in the water or take a break from swimming.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I always made it a habit to go up to the poolside and watch the children as they
            spent the remaining 30 minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;So this is where you are, after all. You set a new record again
            today.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I haven&#39;t reached the time set by the instructors yet, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;We are children. They&#39;re adults. It&#39;s not weird that we can&#39;t beat
            them. It&#39;s more that I can&#39;t beat you anymore, Kiyotaka, and that makes me a little bit
            nervous.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Until a few weeks ago, Yuki was the fastest swimmer, regardless of how she
            swam.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The difference in our records have been widening ever since you passed me once.
            How can you swim so well? We&#39;ve been practicing the same amount, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Breath taking.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Your form is perfect when you are swimming, but when you take a breath, your
            form is off. If you improve that, your time will increase a little.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I see... That wasn&#39;t pointed out by the instructor.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The instructor in charge of swimming doesn&#39;t tell us everything. I think
            they&#39;re making us aware that we have to find out for ourselves.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t noticed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not just looking at yourself, but also into your surroundings. I
            don&rsquo;t have such leeway.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just getting to grips with this too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She&#39;s behind the curve on a lot, especially the curriculum that we&#39;re taking
            on for the first time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you haven&#39;t mastered the basics, you are inevitably focused on learning and
            not on the results.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the other hand, people like Yuki and Shiro often achieve good results the first
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They don&#39;t know the fundamentals as well, but they are able to quickly learn
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sense, you might say. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&#39;s the difference.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, I don&#39;t envy them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It has been proven through many curriculums that even if there is a gap at the
            beginning, you can make up the difference by learning and consolidating the basics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&#39;s okay to be bad at first. You can build the foundation and learn to apply
            yourself first.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki is looking at me as I stand there, not walking away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image10.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;...Do you need something else?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Is it weird that I&#39;m talking to you if I don&#39;t need
            anything?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It is. Normally, you only talk to me if you want something.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You really don&#39;t change.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without looking at her, I began thinking about Yuki.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Recently, she has been talking to me more often.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, she&rsquo;s speaking in a different manner than she usually does.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why is she doing something inefficient like this?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not a bad thing as an object of observation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Besides, the instructors aren&rsquo;t close by listening to us right now, so we
            won&rsquo;t be scolded for this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, I can&rsquo;t deny that we may be being observed, but there is no need to
            aggravate things.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Can I ask one thing?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Sure, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why are conversations your strong point, Yuki?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Are they&hellip; my strong point?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re better than me, at least. I can never become motivated about
            speaking, no matter what I do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m so enthusiastic about it either, but&hellip;
            It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She&rsquo;s talking, even though she herself doesn&rsquo;t understand why? Now
            that&rsquo;s impossible to understand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then, how come you&rsquo;re able to laugh? You laughed before,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why? &hellip;I don&rsquo;t know that either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? Even though you can laugh, you don&rsquo;t know
            why?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m not laughing now, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Indeed, Yuki did laugh before, but I don&rsquo;t remember seeing her laugh since
            then.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Was she able to laugh just once by coincidence?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Are feelings something that just come up by coincidence like that?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel like I can laugh again if I&rsquo;m by your
            side.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comprehend that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is it that you don&rsquo;t feel like laughing unless you&rsquo;re with someone
            specific?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, maybe that does make some sense.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When the instructors show feelings of anger also, they are mostly faced towards
            someone else.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Smiles, too, are something you show others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Thinking of it that way, I can understand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked at Yuki.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Let&rsquo;s try laughing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought so, but I couldn&rsquo;t understand how to laugh.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I haven&rsquo;t even learned the basics of the feelings of joy, anger, sorrow and
            pleasure.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I don&rsquo;t have the basics, I can&rsquo;t do anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If it&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t learned, then feelings are not needed after
            all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I stopped thinking about this any more.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.2grqrue"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">7</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Children are designed to forget most of their memories from infancy, such as at the
            age of one or two.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems this is called infantile amnesia.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The young memories that can be recalled in detail are usually from around age
            3.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, if you ask if memorization is completely impossible in infancy, then
            it&#39;s a no.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Some can remember the details of their infancy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The proof that this is true is nothing else than the fact that this child before my
            eyes, remembers well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;...Flawless.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For him, he is just looking back on his memories and putting them into words.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it is something that no ordinary human being could ever do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An experiment with gummy bears at age 2, and the curriculum that followed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The casual interaction in the pool. Kiyotaka is choosing the necessary memories to
            remember and keeping them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He remembers so vividly that I want to dismiss them as a child&#39;s
            fantasies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After hearing about the past seven years of Kiyotaka&#39;s life, Tabuchi and the
            others in front of him are very excited.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If we announce these research results, the scientific community will be
            shocked&hellip;! This is incredible, Ayanokoji-sensei. Your child is showing results that are on a whole
            different level than the children up until now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tabuchi, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that he&rsquo;s my child. Just tell me how
            &ldquo;incredible&rdquo; he is in a </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">straightforward way.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Y-yes. It is proven that memorization is possible while the baby is inside the
            mother&rsquo;s belly. However, the learning ability of infants is extremely untrained and unstable, so it
            was commonly accepted that they could not keep their memories. Or memories are stored, but as they develop,
            they are buried deep within and cannot be retrieved. It was thought to be one or the other. However, your
            son... No, Kiyotaka, is able to easily retrieve them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;What do you mean? How is that connected to his excellence?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;For example... If we take only the three years between the ages of 0 and 3, he
            has a memory advantage of 1,095 days. Of course, it&#39;s not that simple, but the secret of his
            overwhelming learning ability is also tied to this.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So, even though the children started side by side, there is a big gap in their
            abilities at the age of three?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;He&#39;s a genius, no doubt about it!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It must be the nature of a researcher to talk like this with unquenchable
            excitement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, we cannot simply rejoice in this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">White Room would be meaningless if he were simply dismissed with the word
            &quot;genius&quot;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, neither I nor Kiyotaka&#39;s mother are very bright. In that
            sense, it can&#39;t be directly linked to heredity, but, we can&rsquo;t deny the possibility that this is a
            mutation either, can we?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; That&rsquo;s right. There is much about genes that we
            still don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Listen. This organization&rsquo;s objective isn&rsquo;t to find people who
            were geniuses from birth. Don&rsquo;t forget that our standard is to raise excellent human resources, no
            matter how good or bad their DNA is.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The simple fact that we can create something like this is a joyous occasion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, it would have been better if it wasn&rsquo;t my child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Looking at it as a third party, people will mistakenly see this as me giving my own
            child a special education.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fact that most of the children from the same period and the same curriculum ended
            up as useless trash should be something to regret.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I gave the instruction to return Kiyotaka to the other fourth period students.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m planning to show the situation of the fourth period students to Sakayanagi,
            who will be coming as a visitor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is a proposal to make good use of his abilities, but what do you think
            about letting the children other than the fourth period students learn of his existence? Competition will
            increase their abilities. I think it will be especially effective for the children aiming to get first place
            among all of the periods.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is true that you can only aim for the highest objective you can see. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you are at the top in a small environment, you will understand that there is not
            much more room to grow.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Including Ishida and the others, most of the researchers agree with this
            opinion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, Suzukake spoke out in disagreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s not a bad idea. I agree that it is important to have goals, but if
            they are unattainable, they are meaningless. That&#39;s how big the gap is between Kiyotaka and the rest of
            the children.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;...You have a point there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The important thing is to make them feel that they may be able to catch up even
            though they feel it&#39;s a high goal. We should control the information we disclose and make his abilities
            appear lower than they really are. The children at the top will still doubt his very existence, but we can
            show them evidence of his actual existence in a way that cuts through indirect scenes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So, after that, the rest of them will automatically continue to fight in a world of
            rivalry and non-communion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You can do as you please, but please do not favor Kiyotaka and continue to
            educate the remaining fourth period students as you have done in the past.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Even if the number of dropouts continues to increase, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes. I don&#39;t care if Kiyotaka fails. If we can see the results of the
            more-than-imagined achievements, we can determine the line of defense for when more outstanding students are
            born in the future.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We must not be satisfied with immediate results, but must aim for even greater
            heights.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If my son is crushed in the process, we will be able to gather some sympathy from the
            outside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We will make our enthusiasm for this project known.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;About the fourth period students being given the Beta curriculum, there is a
            cause for concern. The end result of this rigorous education is that they mature mentally too
            quickly.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As Suzukake replied so, Tabuchi quickly continued with his explanation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that, when they are around high school age, they will
            possibly have the psychology of a person that is 20&hellip; No, 30 years old. Combined with the alienation
            of not knowing about the world, it will have the reverse effect of giving them an infantile
            surface.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So we must also think about the possibility of going overboard.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We need a different approach somewhere. Can they learn of their own will, and
            keep growing? However, I&rsquo;m sure that would be quite the gamble. They will change a lot with effects
            from the outside, and their value as a work of art may decrease.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Having led the camp up until this point, Suzukake&rsquo;s face is heavy and
            stiff.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is enough proof that he is at a loss as to what to do from now on.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excuse me. Sakayanagi-sama has entered the inspection room as planned,
            but&hellip; What shall we do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s about time we should go out there, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Keep him there for a while. Keep the curriculum we&rsquo;re showing him simple
            as planned. If we show him something too stimulating and strong, he may end up rejecting it.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I stood up from my seat, and stepped into the inspection room without going to
            Sakayanagi right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, I activated the sound on the cameras set up in the inspection room. Sakayanagi
            is fundamentally in a neutral position, but he is in a position where he may turn over to the enemy side one
            day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The possibility is low, but I can&rsquo;t deny that he may have come here to scout
            the White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">First, I will see the degree of this risk.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can see Sakayanagi&rsquo;s figure on the screen, and a girl who seems to be his
            daughter under his arm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The two seem to be watching the White Room students through the magic mirror.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Look, Arisu. These are the children that may be in charge of Japan&rsquo;s
            future one day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that it was not her father&#39;s initiative to offer to visit on his
            own.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She&rsquo;s looking inside with her hand on the glass, as if taking it all in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image11.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">5 minutes, 10 minutes, without getting bored.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it, Arisu? It&rsquo;s rare for you to be so interested in
            something.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The experiment to artificially create geniuses. There is no way I would not be
            interested in this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Words unfitting of a child, as always.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t sense anything artificial between the father and the daughter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just, aren&rsquo;t there a lot of problematic points with this
            experiment?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think they will be criticized from all sides on a humanitarian
            front.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha, haha&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She possesses the same viewpoint and feelings as an adult, so much so that you would
            not say that she is a child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Above all, I don&rsquo;t think that you can artificially create geniuses. Even
            if such a presence stands out in this facility, would you not say that it is simply the result of the
            experiment?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had intended on meeting them after making some judgments, but I became interested
            in Sakayanagi Arisu&rsquo;s viewpoints.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t get many chances to hear a child&rsquo;s opinions on the White
            Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why do you think that way?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In the end, I think that the ones who stand out are simply the children who
            have excellent DNA.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. Indeed, the curriculum that the children are receiving is strict. There
            is the possibility that the children who survive that may have already been excellent from the start. You
            really are wise, just like her. You have the same personality too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to hear that. I want to be like my mother. That is the best
            praise that I can receive.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As she points out, it is difficult to distinguish between genius and
            mediocrity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The important things for the process of a human being&rsquo;s growth are indeed
            &ldquo;genes&rdquo; and &ldquo;environment&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The reality is that the children who have been granted the environment of the White
            Room aren&rsquo;t necessarily excellent from the stage of their genes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;After all, even if there are children who survive the curriculum, it&rsquo;s
            just that they are blessed by their parents&rsquo; abilities.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It looked like Sakayanagi was bewildered before the issue that even an adult cannot
            give an instant reply to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who knows? It may be so, or it may not be. I don&rsquo;t know either. But, I
            can&rsquo;t throw away the possibility that the children here may be in charge of the future one
            day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He explained so, but the girl did not seem to be very interested in his
            answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She&rsquo;s watching the White Room even more seriously than up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;...That kid, he&#39;s been solving all the challenges so calmly and easily,
            huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s sensei&rsquo;s son. I think his name was&hellip;
            Ayanokoji&hellip; Kiyotaka-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that she quickly noticed how different Kiyotaka is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If he is sensei&rsquo;s kid, his DNA must be excellent, after
            all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Maybe. Still, even if sensei has graduated from a top university, that
            doesn&rsquo;t mean his motor nerves have to be good. His wife is also a really normal person, you know. It
            isn&rsquo;t as if either of his grandparents possessed outstanding talent either. Just, sensei has more
            ambition than anyone I&rsquo;ve met, and is a man of unrelenting will that never gives up. That&rsquo;s why
            he became such a big man. So much that at a time, he tried to move the country.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then&hellip; Does that mean he is the most fitting subject for this
            experiment?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Maybe&hellip; For that person, he must be the ideal child. But&hellip; For me,
            I can&rsquo;t help but feel bad for that child.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He has been living in this facility from the moment of his birth. For him, the
            first thing he saw was not his mother or father, but the white ceiling of this facility. If only he had
            dropped out at an early stage, he could have lived together with sensei. No, maybe it&rsquo;s because
            he&rsquo;s continued to remain here this long that he can receive sensei&rsquo;s affection&hellip; In that
            case&hellip; The final objective of this facility would be to raise all of the children here to become
            geniuses. But, it is still in the experimental stage right now. This is a fight with 50, 100 years in the
            future in mind. The children here aren&rsquo;t meant to show their own talent when they grow up, but to live
            here for the sake of the children of the future. The drop outs, and the ones who remain, are nothing but a
            sample.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Father, do you hate this facility?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The remark that I wanted to say in order to break through the core of the matter,
            came flying from the daughter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Depending on this answer here, there will be a lot of things I will have to think
            about, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hm? Well&hellip; Maybe I can&rsquo;t honestly support this. If the children
            being raised here really grow up to be more excellent than any other. If this facility becomes a normal
            thing. I think that it would only be the beginning of misfortune, and nothing else.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t see much of a connection with Kijima.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The answer is just like Sakayanagi, who is, until the end, a good man.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t worry. I will break through that. I will prove that a
            genius is not something that is decided with education, but something that you are from birth.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m counting on you, Arisu.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The father, happily patting his daughter on the head, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be hiding
            anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;By the way, father. I think I&rsquo;d like to learn how to play
            chess.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There, I cut the sound from the camera, and stood up from my seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess I didn&rsquo;t need to be worried.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I can&rsquo;t be too cautious.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Right now, as the time of the announcement is closing in, there is no telling what
            may happen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.vx1227"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">8</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Repeat. Repeat. Repeat each day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I repeatedly learn each day, as if continuing for an eternity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In this world with almost no rest, I continued repeating the fourth term
            curriculum.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is nothing more to tell any more.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how complicated or difficult it becomes, the things I must do do not
            change.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tomorrow, the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Repeat. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Repeat. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Repeat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The next day, coming in as usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Learn something new again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Breathe. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I don&rsquo;t breathe, I can&rsquo;t live.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Being branded as a dropout is the end, because there is no taking that back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, what&rsquo;s normal yesterday may not continue today.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The buzzer rang.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children obeyed the rules and put their pens on the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At this time, this high difficulty written test curriculum is all finished.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The test papers were collected and the scoring started right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, I already know most of the results before they come out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All of the children remaining here have a grasp on how many of their answers are
            correct.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the seat in front of me, there is a back slightly trembling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked at it without anything in my mind, and waited out the time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One instructor entered, and faced the trembling child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You failed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before that child&hellip; Before Yuki, the instructor calmly declared so in the same
            way as usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With that, it was decided that one more person would drop out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There were only four people remaining in the fourth period, but another seat has now
            disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;B-but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the white room, a problem in the practice and learning stage is considered
            absolute.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The process up until the test doesn&rsquo;t matter, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter
            whether you take 10 points, or 5 points. The instructors simply continue the learning without halt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whether you drop out or not, is all decided at the periodical tests.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you are not able to fulfill the requirements here, you are judged to have no
            talent and become a dropout.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Get up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Short words with no impurities.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you answer that demand, it&rsquo;s all over.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">You will no longer be allowed to live as a White Room student again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if you deny it, it&rsquo;s still the same. Nothing will change.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Despite this, there are always children who resist like Yuki.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it again. Get up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please&hellip; Give me a chance&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki continued resisting while squeezing out her voice, but the instructor cut his
            gaze and looked up to the second stage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He must have called for support after estimating that there will be a
            struggle.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I, I know that I didn&rsquo;t get enough points. B-but, I got through last
            day&rsquo;s physical ability curriculum. I&hellip; I should have gotten 5 points there too. I will study
            until next time, and I promise that I will be able to get enough points&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Leaving the begging Yuki aside, three new instructors came into the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If her grades are as I estimate, they were just short 5 points from the passing
            grade.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Those looking from the outside may say that it is only 5 points, but in the White
            Room, there is no salvation even if you are only short 1 point.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the reality among the many students who have been raised here up until
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A child who has failed to reach the passing line once has a low learning
            ability.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That has been proven. In other words, if they close their eyes here and let her go
            until the next periodical test, there is no changing the fact that she will drop out again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rotten oranges must be taken out. You will only be a burden for the
            others&rsquo; growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t think they want to waste any more time than this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One of the instructors reached out for Yuki&rsquo;s arm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;N-no&hellip; No!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki stood up from her seat while pushing the arm away, and ran up to me in a state
            of disorder.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Help me, Kiyotaka! I, I don&rsquo;t want to disappear!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As tears overflowed, Yuki asked for help.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While keeping an eye on the instructor slowly walking closer, I kept myself
            uninterested.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...!&rdquo;</span></p>

            there is no &ldquo;next&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;B-but..!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Those who cannot work hard now, cannot do so next time either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just like how you have only one life, it is impossible to continue.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But&hellip;! I, I can do it, so&hellip;! I did it before, so..!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The instructors surrounded us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eek!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I stopped the approaching instructor with my eyes, and spoke out to Yuki.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is true that you kept up with the curriculum other than the written test.
            However, you&rsquo;ve only been going down year by year, and didn&rsquo;t show any signs of improvement. In
            other words, this is your limit, Yuki.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if there would be salvation, it would not be the child&rsquo;s decision, but the
            instructors&rsquo;. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At this time, I couldn&rsquo;t think of this as anything but Yuki judging things
            wrongly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! No! I&rsquo;m begging you! Let me do it one more time!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While raising her voice, Yuki showed a bizarre amount of resistance.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It isn&rsquo;t rare conduct for someone who has dropped out, but this is different
            from how Yuki has been acting up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You already know White Room&rsquo;s rules. Why are you making such a
            fuss?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Including me, the White Room students can&rsquo;t comprehend the situation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the instructors understand why Yuki is resisting so much.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yet, they won&rsquo;t put this reason into words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She was forcefully pulled away from clinging to my arm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Help me! No! Kiyotaka! Kiyotakaaa!!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Again and again, she called my name, and asked for help.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Help, me&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While collapsing, she reached out to me with her hands, seeking help.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Help?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The girl before me has already been told that she has failed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The ones who fail leave this room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">And they never come back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are no exceptions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, why is there a need to ask for help?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is nothing but a useless effort; a waste of time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please, I&hellip; No, I don&rsquo;t want to&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to
            leave!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The two adults who have been watching her refuse to leave the room rushed
            inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, they pulled the girl out of the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! No! Help me!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure the remaining children are also looking at her with cold eyes, just
            like me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Or, they may be afraid that they will be next.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as I can be the last one to remain here, I&rsquo;m fine with that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From the very start, I&rsquo;ve been living in this world with that feeling in
            mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I continued living in this white world. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We continued learning in the same years together, like family, or, perhaps, on a
            completely different level, the crying came from a fondness for the opposite gender.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To be taken out of this place is to have yourself completely denied.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why everyone continued studying, so that this would not happen to
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please wait.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I quietly whispered so and spoke out to the instructors.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who said you can talk? If you open your mouth again, it&rsquo;s not going to
            end well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine with me, so please hear me out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After I said these words, the instructor approached me without speaking or hesitating
            and struck me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t allowed you to speak.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yuki looked ill since before lunch. She could not calm down turing the test
            either, and she couldn&rsquo;t display her true talent on anything except the ability sections,
            so-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was trying to continue, my chest was grasped and I was taken up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Being in a ready condition is part of your true ability. Do you think that
            kind of excuse will be accepted at this point? In the first place, she looked just fine this
            morning.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is true. However, if it was something she could not anticipate, that
            changes things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Something she could not anticipate?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The instructor turned around, and looked at the other instructors surrounding Yuki on
            the ground.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...She is bleeding.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that the instructors have also noticed that Yuki was not in a normal
            condition.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Bleeding? Was she wounded somewhere&hellip; Ah, I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. Normally, it can start as early as 9 years old, but this is quite out of
            the ordinary. Perhaps it is because of the high amount of stress she is under, unlike the students from the
            other terms. It looks like she has a fever too, so perhaps you can accept this as an unpredictable condition
            of poor physical health.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;To the doctor&rsquo;s office. We&rsquo;ll decide whether she&rsquo;s failed or
            not after properly examining her.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The instructor said so and gave the instruction, and Yuki was carried out of the
            room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yuki looked at me as she was being taken away while crying, but I did not meet her
            eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You did well to notice. I&rsquo;d like to say that, but we would have noticed
            it after this even if you hadn&rsquo;t pointed it out. It is a problem that you spoke without being allowed
            to, after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Will you punish me, then?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Breaking the rules outside the curriculum brings with it bodily punishment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, in the end, that&rsquo;s all it is.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know that it will not go so far as to make me drop out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you making fun of me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re watching from the sides, please observe more
            carefully.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...You little shit!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Too slow. The instructor squeezed his right fist with killer intent, but I dodged
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A different instructor quickly stopped the instructor that showed an extreme
            reaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let a child&rsquo;s words sway you, rookie.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are inexperienced instructors, but this new instructor is going to make more
            mistakes in the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is why it is necessary to make this known now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he is useful, he will be educated better. If he is judged to be useless, he will
            be dealt with.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, in the end, after this day, Yuki did not come back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.3fwokq0"><span class="c9">Part </span><span>9</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After some time, the fourth term students disappeared, and there were the two of us
            left in the room. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Me and Shirou.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A few months passed after it became just the two of us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We did not converse even once in that time, and each day passed in silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I don&rsquo;t mind. Rather, I thought this was more comfortable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With my conversations with Yuki disappearing, I was able to focus more on my own
            learning.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Today is the first judo day in a few days.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the curriculums increased, the designated matches were only being held once every
            few days.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Still, both Shirou and I have been improving our techniques. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Although the competitions were different, the results of our training allowed us to
            apply and become familiar with many martial arts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Conduct randori with each other as usual. I&rsquo;ll be out for a
            moment.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if he was called from somewhere, the instructor who was the referee left the room
            in a hurry.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Left with each other in the room, we began our randori as instructed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Shirou has been repeating the same thing for tens, hundreds of times.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Got a moment?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What broke the silence that has been continuing for these months, was Shirou
            whispering by my ear.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought it may be a psychological attack, but his movements had completely
            stopped.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a lot of years since I beat you in judo, right?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After my first two defeats at the start, I&rsquo;ve continued winning every
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Boxing, karate, jeet kune do, it&rsquo;s all the same. Even if I win the first
            or second round, after it turns around once, I can&rsquo;t do anything any more. You really are
            incredible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why is he saying something like this in the middle of randori?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is one thing I want to say to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Trying to avoid the instructors&rsquo; notice, the close distance whispering
            continued.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I decided to leave this facility.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The only ones who can leave this place are the ones who drop
            out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I will drop out myself and leave. Looking at the tendencies
            of the dropouts and the adults chasing them out, I can imagine what kind of path to take. I know that I
            won&rsquo;t be killed, at least.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you going to do when you leave into the outside world? Is there a
            point to this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is. I want freedom.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Freedom?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want to be free. I want friends. Isn&rsquo;t it normal to have such
            feelings? Look around. It&rsquo;s only you and I left here. This is going to continue for 10 more years, you
            know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t understand the meaning of what Shirou is saying.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why does he want something like that?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you not interested in the outside world? No, can you stand the suffering
            here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never held such interests or doubts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The one-sided knowledge we are granted. This cramped space. Are you satisfied
            with this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dissatisfied, at least.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am clearly growing in the days that I&rsquo;m learning in White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Doesn&rsquo;t he want to see how much he can grow?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t receive this education in the outside world. In other words,
            leaving would reduce the efficiency of my self-improvement.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re strange, you know. I want to see the real world, not the
            virtual one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Objectively, I can see clearly that many children dislike having their lives
            restrained like this. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, no one thought that they should drop out after not being able to endure
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was convinced when Yuki dropped out. Looking at her, I was even
            jealous.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If this is the answer Shirou came up with, then there is nothing for me to
            say.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I thought you were the same as me. I thought that you would want to enter the
            outside world one day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, but I never thought like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I see. I wanted to invite you to leave with me, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adults observing, just like me, probably don&rsquo;t know about his
            thoughts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fact that Shirou holds various feelings towards this facility.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He shouldn&rsquo;t know of anything that he hasn&rsquo;t been taught, they&rsquo;re
            sure of that. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the discovery is that, just like the person before me, there are those who
            want nothing more than to leave the White Room right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t know if this discovery will have any meaning after I become the last
            one remaining, though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ahead&hellip; Let&rsquo;s meet again some day,
            Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t reply to those words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just, I can feel his extraordinary determination. I can feel his spirit, something
            that I&rsquo;ve never felt when he was trying to beat me in these fights. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The one before me is not an easy foe compared to the half-hearted adults. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image12.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Guh!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I parried Shirou&rsquo;s attack, and took the round in a clean manner.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as I&rsquo;ve learned the same things as my foe, I will never be
            defeated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he puts out 120 units of strength, I will put out 130.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he puts out 140, I will put out 150.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">How comfortable the White Room is, how important freedom is, none of it
            matters.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The important thing is that there is still a lot here that I should learn.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In order to improve myself, this is a path that I should not avoid.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, my curiosity for knowledge still remains in this White Room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if the referee wasn&rsquo;t nearby, we are always being observed from the room
            on the second stage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I beat Shirou down onto the mat, and the instructor let us know that this was the
            conclusion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I lost again, after all. I wish I better remembered the time when I
            won.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Holding his head with his arms and breathing heavily, Shirou put to words his fading
            memories.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I kept losing in these 5 years. I knew that even if I remained in this place,
            I could never win&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you really going to drop out?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. I will find the right timing, and leave this White Room.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that he doesn&rsquo;t intend on changing his mind any more.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I cannot comprehend it. Leaving the White Room, in any manner, is death.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Letting yourself die. I cannot think in this way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I&rsquo;m sure Shirou has his own thoughts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he wants to harm himself, I won&rsquo;t stop him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Goodbye, Shirou.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Goodbye, Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This was the last conversation between me and Shirou.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.1v1yuxt"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">10</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A short while after that, Shirou dropped out. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The last person disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My memories after that became simple.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without anyone to talk to in the real sense, depending on the curriculum, some days
            ended without even opening my mouth other than to eat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even after becoming completely alone, what I had to do did not change.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If there is something that changed, that would be mostly related to hand-to-hand
            combat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have been competing with White Room students up until now, but as they all
            disappeared, the opponents I fought inevitably were adults.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Around 9 years old, I defeated all of the instructors that had educated me up until
            then.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps that&rsquo;s why the instructors had now all hurriedly gathered inside the
            room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kiyotaka. I will now make you fight with multiple people in the shape of an
            actual fight. Think of it as a compilation of everything you have learned up until now. I will allow you to
            use any method necessary.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Further, no holding back is needed. You can fight with the intent to
            kill.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you saying that it&rsquo;s alright if I actually kill them
            too?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The large room for our practice. Adults that were wearing suits entered.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All new faces.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adults looked at me, and started laughing like idiots.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I thought it was a joke, but you&rsquo;re really making us fight this brat,
            huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They are clearly different from the adults that have been teaching me hand-to-hand
            combat up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Their movements were not flowing, but instead were rough and aggressive.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Are they supposed to be opponents who can fight in an asymmetric battle instead of an
            equal one?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The difference in muscle mass is obvious.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I fight these opponents head on, I will lose even if I try a hundred times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know this is ridiculous. It&rsquo;s ridiculous, but don&rsquo;t hold back.
            I&rsquo;m telling you that you&rsquo;re going to get that amount of money by just overpowering one child.
            You can think of him as someone who possesses extraordinary technique.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Someone who seems to have a higher standing among the men told them so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Listen. You&rsquo;re going to come at us like you&rsquo;re trying to kill us.
            No, try to kill us. If you don&rsquo;t come at us with the spirit and mettle befitting of that, I&rsquo;m
            going to feel bad about beating you away.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man who seems to be the leader said so, and pointed to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He doesn&rsquo;t need to say it; that&rsquo;s my intent. I&rsquo;ve already received
            my orders.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If necessary, I will give you the weapon you need.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying so, the man put his bag on the floor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A metallic sound echoed out from the floor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Are you saying you&rsquo;ll do this bare-handed?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re messing with us, but&hellip; We&rsquo;re
            serious too. Just pick one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked up to the instructor looking down from the second floor and asked for an
            order.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an order. Do as that man says. They should all be things
            you&rsquo;ve already learned how to use.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In that case, I will only obey.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked into the bag.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Baton, stun gun, knife, you can pick whichever one you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Indeed, they are all things that I have seen, held in my hands, and learned how to
            use in the past.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I want simple lethality, it&rsquo;s the knife, but I want reach.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will pick this one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I reached out to the baton without hesitation, and grabbed it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The baton from the bag is about 30 centimeters in length.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you know how to use it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If I swing it, I will have a reach of 80 centimeters. I&rsquo;m supposed to
            hit my foes with that, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In order to win, I have to accurately break through the human&rsquo;s vital
            points.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure my foe doesn&rsquo;t have experience fighting an opponent of my
            stature.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to make use of the fact that it will be difficult to confront someone of small
            stature.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After a few minutes, as the last adult had collapsed with his leg broken, I raised my
            baton.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll hit the top of his head with this, and at least make him lose
            consciousness with one attack.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I can&rsquo;t do that, I&rsquo;ll just have to make a second attack to crush his
            skull.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After hearing the voice echoing through the room, I stopped my movements and lightly
            threw the baton far away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Volume 0/images/image13.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adults rushed into the room and helped the collapsed adult.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the hell is this..? Carry him to the doctor&rsquo;s office right
            now!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Looking at his condition and seeing that he is heavily wounded, the medical team
            carried him out on a stretcher.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you trying to do, Kiyotaka?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was ordered to try to kill them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In order to get a confirmation, I asked again if it is really okay.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So what&rsquo;s the problem with this?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The instructors were speechless before the situation, but the room&rsquo;s door was
            opened right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A-Ayanokoji-sensei!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Take care of these guys. I want to talk with Kiyotaka for a bit. Come with
            me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Orders are absolute.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I followed him without hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There would usually be numerous instructors by his side, but it looks like he&rsquo;s
            alone today.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think you already comprehend this, but I am the one in charge of this White
            Room, and your real father.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I never directly called myself your father, so when did you find
            out?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When I was 4 years old. I remember hearing it when you were talking with the
            instructors.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re continuously showing overwhelming achievements as a fourth
            period student. Before I noticed, it was just you left, and you&rsquo;ve been continuing to silently show
            perfect&hellip; no, more than perfect results in the curriculums.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Father. For me, that isn&rsquo;t anything special.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just, the reality that he is so. Nothing more, nothing less.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;For me, you&rsquo;re a special presence.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;White Room has been in operation for only a short 14, 15 years, but I still
            can&rsquo;t imagine a genius of your caliber being born in the years ahead either. Leaving aside the first,
            second and the third periods, even the fifth period students are nothing special. Of course, as the terms
            progress, we are reducing our shortcomings and overcoming our challenges, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I think I&rsquo;m not mistaken in that I am being praised.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, as my father says, this is simply the truth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can go back now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What was the point of this conversation?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps it&rsquo;s related to the device attached to my hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if supporting this theory, the man began speaking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How were the results?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t even a slight disturbance in Kiyotaka&rsquo;s pulse, not
            while fighting and not while conversing with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;His heart did not move a bit even after telling him that he was a special
            presence, huh? No, I think I can say that his heart already no longer functions as that of a human
            being.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;For Kiyotaka, that is a strong point, and also a shortcoming that he cannot
            get rid of.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ishida is right. It is fine to have a minimal amount of joy, anger, sorrow,
            pleasure and such, but emotions are still indispensable. It would have been enough if he had even half of
            what an average person has left, but in Kiyotaka&#39;s case, it is almost zero. He is suited to be an
            educator and a politician, but at the same time, he is not suited to be one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The two adults comfortably talked without hiding anything with the person in question
            just before them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This must be a part of the curriculum too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I&rsquo;m being praised or disparaged about
            anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The only thing that matters is whether I drop out or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Perhaps it is impossible to learn joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure in the
            environment of the White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. However, he can lie skillfully when it is needed. Even if he lacks the
            feelings of joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure, I think I can say that he knows how to make use of
            them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely the problem. It is already too late for him to learn
            joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure in the White Room. In which case, there is nothing else to do but to change
            his environment.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Up until now, I&rsquo;ve educated many children from the first period to the
            currently running 13th period. As the difficulty of the curriculums also greatly differ, Ayanokoji Kiyotaka
            alone is clearly of a different quality. I can&rsquo;t say that it is favoritism because he is your son, he
            is abnormal.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is true. No matter how harsh the environment, Kiyotaka quickly shows his
            ability to adapt. Every child has hit a plateau, so why is Kiyotaka alone the exception? Why does he
            completely absorb everything we teach him?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; It is easy to dismiss it with a word like atavism,
            but without investigating this matter, the White Room cannot be truly perfect.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If I can provide a stable supply of talented people equal to or greater than
            this child, my ideal will come true. Thoroughly clarify this. Don&rsquo;t stop thinking until you comprehend
            everything. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m paying you all to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I will continue to receive this education. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What awaits at the end, what lies beyond the quest for knowledge?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s all I want to know.</span></p>
