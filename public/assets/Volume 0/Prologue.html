    <h2 class="c1" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c20 c16 c11">Ayanokoji Atsuomi&rsquo;s Monologue</span></h2>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Wealth, poverty. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The difference between the rich and the poor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c45">High academic achievements, inferior education.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The gap between education.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The city, the countryside. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The gap between regions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The young who were not blessed, the old who were. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The gap between generations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">This Japan is a society of gaps.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I have only shown one part, but it truly represents both heaven and hell.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The important thing is, that for the most part, circumstance is by no means something
            that cannot be changed. If a man of poverty can grow to become wealthy, a man of wealth can also fall into
            poverty.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">If one is displeased with the disparity between regions, they may head into the big
            city.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">While understanding the logic, I still had nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Born in the countryside, extremely poor, and a pathetically poor academic
            history.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">With my physical strength also only average, even if I was endowed with perseverance,
            it is not as if I was a hard worker.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">If I ever looked strong enough to have the characteristics of a fighter, that was
            simply my youth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">However, without realizing this potential, I spent my life wasting most of my time
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I was, indeed, a man crawling on the dirt.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Without the expectation of anything resembling a bright future, there was only the
            simple possibility of living a pathetic life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">However, with my own hands, I cut open my future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Because I had one thing, just one, that I possessed more than anyone else.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c45">That was, my &ldquo;</span><span class="c36 c45">ambition</span><span
            class="c5">&rdquo;, to keep consistently fighting without halt.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">[TL Note 1 : There are two meanings for the word translated into
            &ldquo;ambition&rdquo;: </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">1: Ambition, aspiration </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">2: Sinister plans, treachery. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c45">There isn&rsquo;t really anything indicating it was used with the second meaning but
            I wanted to let you know. The author </span><span class="c36 c45">might</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;have
            also used this word on purpose to indicate both meanings.]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">No matter what, I will rise up to the top of this country.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I have lived up until now with that one idea in my heart.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">That ambition alone was what supported my life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">As I faced my 25th years of age, for the first time, I gained eligibility to be
            elected in politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I had saved up a sum of 3,000,000 with my part-time job.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">With this, I was to become a politician, a member of the assembly, and make a name
            for myself as a man of great fortune.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">A faint, hard to achieve dream. Taking the election lightly, I failed in a way that
            was painful to even watch.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">It would have been fine if it had ended there, but as I could not even reach the
            minimum amount of votes, the 3,000,000 that I spent all my life saving up was confiscated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Poverty resolution, clean politics, countermeasures against the declining birthrate,
            wage increases, NO WAR.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I thought that if I simply lined up some lip service, the election would be
            easy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">A shallow and foolish idea. Anyone can think of and realize shallow ideas like
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">What mattered for winning the election was which organisation you belonged to, and
            who you were under.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Whether you can differentiate friend from foe and endure being wrapped up for the
            long haul.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">What happened after that? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Did I think that I was ruined?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I wanted to join the ruling party, the &ldquo;Citizen&rsquo;s Party&rdquo;, and
            started my first step as a politician.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">That&rsquo;s correct, after two years, I entered the election again, and was
            elected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">From when I was 27 years old, I succeeded in reaching a position where I could put
            all of my life, my heart and blood, into politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Perhaps I was able to become the winning side, then, but&hellip; for me, being
            elected was not the goal.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Most of all, the world of politics isn&rsquo;t so easy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">No, it would not be an exaggeration to say that, in a certain meaning, it is a deeply
            dark world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Because, even if I had the spirit, I was nothing but a young and alone parliament
            member with no shield or power behind me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Half of the people who are able to rise up, are second or third-generationers granted
            the privilege at the time of birth. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The sons of big politicians, ignorant, foolish and unaware of the impending crisis,
            are just repeating their dull delusions on TV day and night, like carbonic acid losing its air.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">There are those who make a name for themselves in the entertainment world, and move
            over to the world of politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Most of them are nothing more than crowd attractors, but they still have a bigger
            chance than nameless politicians like me. It&#39;s an ironic story.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">As such, the methods for me to make a name for myself as a politician... The choices
            I had were limited.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">To take on the dirty work in the shadows that no one wants to do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">A role in which if I failed, my life as a politician would have been over... or,
            depending on the case, I might even have received a criminal complaint against me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">By taking this on by my own volition, I was able to slightly increase my presence
            inside the party.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Before long, as the hidden sword of &quot;Naoe Sensei&quot;, who bound together many
            factions in the Citizen&#39;s Party, I had my hands in all kinds of evil deeds. Mediation of underage girls,
            bribery, espionage to hostile organizations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Once I was assigned to this project, the boundaries between right and wrong were
            removed for the sake of success.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">There were times when I would come in contact with Yakuza or other criminal gangs and
            resort to violent means.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I had no time to rest, and, as I continued to challenge, before long, I was gaining
            influence inside the party; when I was 36 years old, I was able to gain some political power.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">However... from this point on.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">In order to jump into the center of the political world, more achievements, and
            transgressions, would be necessary.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">A newborn, one month old baby.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The first time I saw my child through the glass, he was staring blankly at the
            ceiling.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">No special feelings came up in my mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">If I was forced to say, the only feeling I had was the relief that my key to move the
            people upstairs had arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">For almost around a year, this is what I had been waiting for.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;We&#39;ve completed the health check.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Any problems?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Currently, there aren&#39;t any problems. No problems were found in the EEG and
            all the other tests. The results of the DNA analysis were also all good.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Tabuchi, completing all of the tests, looked at the results and gave me his
            report.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">We can&#39;t allow anything to stop us at this pre-start stage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">With this being cleared up, I could say that I was able to go through the first
            stage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;You may come in direct contact with him now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;No need. Just like all the children up until now, start the tests right
            away.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The White Room project is already on the fourth stage. There is no need to waste
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I stopped to look at my child, who was being carried out with my instructions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">If I enter him into the White Room, I suppose I will not be seeing him for a long
            time. Right?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Wait a bit.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I headed down to my son, who was behind the glass that separated us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Being directly in front of him, I could once again feel this small life close to
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">He could not hold his head up, so I slipped my hand behind his neck, and gently
            picked him up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;You are Sensei&#39;s son, after all. A rigorous education is awaiting you from
            now on, but I hope you can achieve the results that&mdash;&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;What are you saying? Get ready for the photographs right away.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Huh..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Tabuchi was stunned, as if he did not understand my intent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;I&#39;m sending my child, who is even more important than my own life, into the
            White Room. You should capture this determination and tension with a camera. It will be important
            promotional material for the next fund-raiser.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">A parent giving away a child he has no interest in, or a parent wanting to hold on to
            his child but giving him away for the sake of the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I don&#39;t even have to think about which one would pull more eyes at the
            galleria.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Huh...? Ah, o-okay.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Tabuchi, hurriedly taking out his phone, took a photograph and video of me holding my
            child.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">After about a minute of this performance, I put the baby down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Take him away.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;U-understood.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I put my sight away from the baby, and started preparing for the coming event.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Anyhow, all the necessary preparations have been completed. Please connect me
            to Sakayanagi.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">It had been about 10 years since I stepped into the world of politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Outwardly, I&#39;ve been slurping muddy water with a smile on my face, but that ends
            today. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I&#39;m starting a new life for myself here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I will use and sacrifice anything I can, including my own child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Even Naoe Sensei, who reigns as the absolute authority, is nothing more than a
            stepping stone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">He is an enemy; one that I will eventually have to surpass and crush.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;If you don&#39;t want to die, you have to struggle for yourself.

    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Whether you are a baby or an adult, in the end, you have to do everything
            yourself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">Your circumstances may be awful, but, unfortunately, it is the same way for
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">If you had been raised as a family member under me, you would have been even more
            neglected. In that sense, I could say that you are still off to a good start.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I quietly closed my eyes by myself, in the room where my child had disappeared
            from.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">However, you never know what life will bring.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">I never thought that I would have a child of my own blood in any shape or
            form.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">The turning point came around 4 years after I started working under Naoe
            Sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">That&#39;s right. It was then, when I learned of the White Room project&#39;s
            existence.</span></p>
