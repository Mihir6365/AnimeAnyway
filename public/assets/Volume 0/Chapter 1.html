    <h3 class="c1" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c9 c16">Intro</span></h3>
    <p class="c7 c19"><span class="c20 c16 c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A traditional Japanese restaurant. Sasagawa. It&#39;s the latter half of January,
            there is no snow but it is a day of below freezing temperature.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Already, for an hour under the cold sky, I have continued waiting for the arrival of
            the owner.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s cold, isn&#39;t it, Ayanokoji-san... I wonder when Naoe-sensei will be
            coming..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa, whining again for a third time, is breathing into his hands to warm them
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s always the same. For Naoe-sensei, a set time is nothing but a simple
            suggestion.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Wait, does that mean that he could be late an hour, or even two
            hours?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is likely, that this is the worst feature of this man.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;How naive. We&#39;re lucky if he comes here today. A lot of times, he never
            shows up at all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Wow... No way... Then, how long will you wait for someone who might not even
            come?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Indefinitely. As long as there is not a message from him, I will wait even if
            the restaurant closes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You&#39;ll end up dead in that case, you know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;If I can consider myself a part of the Naoe faction, then I would gladly die
            for him. Though, Naoe-sensei would never be concerned about someone dying.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We&#39;re nothing but attendants of the intermediary role.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Rather, it&#39;s the person simmering inside waiting for Naoe-sensei who must be
            uncomfortable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;But... it&#39;s amazing to be forgiven for being careless with time like this.
            &nbsp;Normally, that would make people angry.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Careless with time, is that really what you think?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I mean, isn&#39;t it true?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Even arriving late becomes a weapon in Naoe-sensei&#39;s hands. It&#39;s even
            in an anecdote of Miyamoto Musashi, Ganryuujima.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, normally one would not use such old, useless battle strategies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This display of power can be forgiven precisely because it is Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Obviously, 80% of the people who get stood up can do nothing but cry and go
            home.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">These numeral figures, they&#39;re the proof that there is no one who can defy
            Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even the current prime minister has to ask Naoe-sensei for instructions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how much I am made to wait, I will welcome Naoe-sensei with a smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The remaining 20%... who are those?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;What use is there in asking about the remaining 20%, the idiots?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;A-as a reference...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The idiots get annoyed after being stood up, and roughen their voice. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, they approach me, as if about to strike at me, and demand so: </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;How long are you going to make me wait? Quickly, call Naoe-sensei&quot;, and
            such.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Rumbling his throat, Kamogawa next to me swallowed his saliva.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even this man, for whom it had not been many days since joining the world of
            politics, understands how terrifying it would be to give an order to Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, each time, I hold a resolute attitude and deal with every member the same
            way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I don&#39;t want Naoe-sensei to be taken lightly. I&#39;ll just kick you
            out.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Will you lower your head or ask for another appointment, or will you not show your
            face a second time?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With this, 80% of people again lower their heads.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While cursing in their hearts, they put priority on getting an audience. Well, at the
            point where they make this choice, the chance for them having a smooth relationship with Naoe-sensei mostly
            disappears.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It must be a lot of trouble when you are in the middle like that,
            Ayanokoji-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I know I must spare no effort, but it isn&#39;t just once or twice that
            I&#39;ve been hit. I&#39;ve even almost been killed by an ash-tray or a golf-club.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as they can&#39;t put their hands on Naoe-sensei, that frustration has
            nowhere to go but me. However, it isn&#39;t like hitting me will get them rewarded by Naoe-sensei.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;That&#39;s very rough. Has it been the same all these four years,
            Ayanokoji-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s simple, but not everyone can do this work. You really have to give it
            your all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&#39;s precisely why this chance came to me, someone with no-one behind him, no
            academic achievements, no intelligence, and no social standing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Still, this guy is way too clueless.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Didn&#39;t parliament member Kamogawa teach you the ironclad
            rules?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man standing next to me, he is one of the kinds of politicians that I despise
            the most.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Father didn&#39;t say anything about that...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Typical second-generation. Leeches, being raised spoiled and eternally continuing to
            live in the world of politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is a loathsome leech, but, he can become a chosen one, being born into a rich,
            privileged social standing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">His father, Parliament Member Kamogawa Toshizou who has been supporting Naoe-sensei
            for quite a few years, is a great veteran with more than 30 years in politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, his son would not be allowed to experience severeness in the low ranks.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is not a pawn to use up and throw away like me, as such, he will continue to be
            valued as one of the parts holding up the Naoe faction&#39;s framework.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;What I did learn, was that as a politician, it was best to shut up and follow
            along with Naoe-sensei. That I can be a parliament member for a long time and have a stable income, and that
            I could get a pretty good position one day.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He became a politician not because there are things he wants to accomplish, but
            simply to make a living.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A lot of people like this exist, whether second-generation or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a foolish and rotten thought, but, for the guys above, a presence from whom
            they can gain a vote from without any discontent and complaining is one to be thankful for.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I want to get up from the bottom of the ladder and get a comfortable job
            already.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa, looking up at the night sky while mumbling and muttering.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m hungry, too... All they have on a cold day like this is hot
            sake.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Enough, Kamogawa. Shut up for a bit.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Come on, it&#39;s good to chat, at least. It&#39;s not like Sensei is here.
            More importantly, please, tell me more about yourself and Naoe-sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;About myself?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m hearing rumours. That despite the fact most people under Naoe-sensei
            become useless right away, you&#39;re being valued and being expected to do well. I want to know the details
            of your secret methods.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa, swallowing the rumours and speaking as if talking about other people&#39;s
            affairs. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am being pressed by the impulse to punch him away right now, but, the only thing
            that would earn me is a momentary sense of relief.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m considered a newcomer, even after four years. I have to make this fact the
            main issue.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The time for chatting is over. Put it off your mind.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Eh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After faintly hearing the taxi from afar, I corrected my posture.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa also understood what this meant, cleared his throat and straightened his
            back.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The taxi slowly parked in front of the restaurant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Immediately after, a black painted Sedan also parked a little behind the taxi.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without even needing to glance at it, it is clear that they are Naoe-sensei&#39;s
            bodyguards. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I returned my gaze to the taxi right away, yet, the door did not open, and Kamogawa
            tilted his neck with curiosity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He was able to see Naoe-sensei&#39;s figure through a window so he was about to start
            running, but I stopped him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Don&#39;t do anything selfish.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Huh? B-but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the taxi&#39;s backseat, from what can be seen by peeking in through the window, I
            can see a man and a woman intimately touching each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If we do something to bother them now, I am afraid of unnecessarily being
            reprimanded.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it is rare for Naoe-sensei to take a woman along.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, even if it is a taxi in the middle of the night, as a politician, I
            can&#39;t think of this as anything but a careless move.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After around a minute of silence in the taxi, the door to the backseat of the taxi
            finally opened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;See ya, Sensei~&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As we could hear the wheedling voice of the young girl who was in the back, Kamogawa
            also finally understood.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After that, Naoe-sensei spent some time chatting with the woman, but then he slowly
            exited the taxi.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From the driver&#39;s seat of the Sedan behind, a slender man quickly came
            out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without saying anything, he silently stood next to Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This body-guard is a new face that I haven&#39;t seen before. However, I don&#39;t
            have the leeway to worry about that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Thank you for your hard work, Naoe-sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;T-thank you!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Was he shaken because of the scene with that woman, or is it simply because he&#39;s
            in front of Naoe-sensei?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if it was the latter, this is very stupid at a time where it shouldn&#39;t even
            look like it is the former.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Stepping one foot ahead of the eyesore that is Kamogawa, I blocked his face with my
            shoulder.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it may have been an unnecessary worry.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei, not even taking a look at Kamogawa, had his sharp eyes just on the
            restaurant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Where&#39;s Asama?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The suit he wore and his posture made it hard to think of him as an old man, and at
            the same time made the others around feel a sense of youth from him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I have had the pleasure of waiting for you. I will humbly guide you to
            him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">[ TL Note 2 : This sentence isn&#39;t a direct translation but he speaks in an
            extremely respectful way in the original text and this is the best way to reflect that with some
            paraphrasing. ]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I gestured with my eyes to the nervous Kamogawa behind me that he should pay the taxi
            fare, and guided Naoe-sensei into the restaurant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As we went under the curtain, everyone from the proprietress to the head chef quickly
            presented themselves and bowed their heads.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei, putting on a big aura and not changing his expression, took off his
            shoes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While stepping on the wooden floor, he headed for the private room at the back of the
            restaurant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe Jinnosuke. Based in the ruling party, the Citizens Party, he has experience in
            many positions such as Minister of Transport, Minister of Economy, and currently works as Secretary General.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without mentioning the Prime Minister, his position is only half a step behind the
            Vice President, but, speaking of it in terms of importance, I can say that the Secretary General is
            certainly higher. He is the general manager holding the party&#39;s real power. The man is 68 years old now,
            but, there is still not even a hint of him retiring from his current role. In the world of politics where
            there is no age limit, as long as there is not a bodily problem, I think this man can continue to hold his
            position for 10, or even 20 more years.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Asama-sensei, I have brought Naoe-sensei here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Beyond the sliding door, Asama-sensei was waiting, seated, to welcome
            Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Upon seeing Naoe-sensei, he stood up, and deeply bowed down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Asama Hisashi. He is 71 years old, 3 years older than Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Currently, he works as the vice minister of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
            Transport and Tourism, and is a leading figure in the Naoe faction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To me, even Asama-sensei is a resident of the clouds above.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, when Naoe-sensei showed up here, he instantly switched from master to slave.
            It is a regularly occurring scene that shows at a glance how much power difference there is between the
            two.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I have been waiting for you, Naoe-sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m sorry to have kept you waiting, Asama. I was busy with work.&quot;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I know how busy you are.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I bowed down so deep that I almost rubbed my forehead against the tatami mat, and
            quietly closed the sliding door so as to not disturb the two&#39;s conversation. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From this point of view, listening to the two big-name politicians talk would not be
            allowed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;This is quick, Naoe-sensei, but about that thing...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We are only separated by a sliding door. The devil has been whispering to me to
            eavesdrop and pick up useful information. I could even install a bug.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, this world is not so easy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I was planning any conspiracies, this evil deed would quickly be exposed and my
            political life would be cut short.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I got up, left the place, and moved to a room far away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c16 c14">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the private room that was provided, Kamogawa was sitting down as if prostrating,
            and focusing solely on the sake in front of his eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Kept you waiting, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;No. Let&#39;s start right away too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Don&#39;t drink alcohol.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;W-what? But there&#39;s this delicious sake put here right in front of my eyes.
            What is this brand? I&#39;ve never seen it in an izakaya before.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Do you want them to smell alcohol when we&#39;re seeing them off? This thing is
            just for decoration. There&#39;s nothing to gain by carelessly putting our hands on it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;But...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A high-class traditional Japanese restaurant that dazzles the eye. I have no
            intention of condemning him for his desire to drink before the meal. In truth, in the old days, I&#39;ve
            almost lost to temptation many times too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Fortunately, I witnessed the moment of the man who was taking care of me back then
            being reprimanded and then eliminated for putting his hands on alcohol, which is connected to my abstinence
            now. The ones who hold power are drinking by making a side-dish of the humans below them, that&#39;s what I
            decided to think.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Not just the parliament members below them. They look down on the citizenry
            itself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They are always intoxicated by the fulfilment of their desire for conquest, which
            they rule by the rules of their own making.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Ayanokoji-sensei, there is one thing on my mind.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This guy really likes talking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Why do you always sit on your knees? You can sit as you want in this seat,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m used to it. I have to comfortably sit on my knees for hours in front of
            Naoe-sensei and the others. If I don&#39;t get used to it in regular times, I&#39;ll be in trouble when the
            time comes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am not even allowed to say something like &quot;Is it okay even if I break my
            legs?&quot;. There is no option but to continue sitting on my knees until my legs go necrotic.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;T-that&#39;s terrible...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa, who probably has no confidence sitting on his knees, hurriedly sat back
            down into his seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even an egg-tofu dish served on a small plate can cost four figures if ordered as a
            single item.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I am not grateful. I roughly grabbed the small plate with my hand, and
            pushed it into my stomach without even chewing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Whoah, what a waste..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I continued eating, ignoring most of the drivel Kamogawa was chatting to me
            about.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am not interested in how expensive it is, how fresh it looks, or where the plate
            came from.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as I can intake enough energy to be able to move afterwards, that&#39;s what
            matters.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m going to the bathroom.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I lightly told Kamogawa, got up on my slightly numb feet, and left the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After using the toilet, I was about to return to the private room where Kamogawa was
            waiting for me, when I saw a group of men in suits.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Among them, was a single man who stood out of the crowd.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it was only for a moment that I saw him, and he turned a corner ahead in the
            corridor and disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;That was...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was pressed by the urge to chase after him and find out his identity, but I have to
            restrain myself here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the back of that figure definitely looked like Parliament Member Kijima.
            Unaffiliated with Naoe-sensei, Isomaru-sensei, or Prime Minister Miyako, he is the fourth force in the
            Citizens Party.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is so promising that he is even praised as the man closest to the Prime Minister
            among the younger generation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It cannot be that they just happened to be at the same restaurant at the same
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because it is customary for the restaurant to privately arrange things so as not to
            create a clash in schedules.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Could it be that Naoe-sensei has already begun to make moves towards the next
            term&#39;s election?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <h3 class="c1" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">2</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was about two hours after Naoe-sensei entered the private room when the meeting
            ended.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After seeing Parliament Member Asama off, Kamogawa and I were called to the private
            room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Parliament Member Kijima must have been in this room after all, as the number of
            bowls were the same, but there were three sake cups.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, seeing that there was no trace of the chopsticks being used, it wasn&#39;t
            as if he was enjoying the meal and the conversation seemed to be over. &nbsp;It seems that he just drank one
            or two cups of sake and listened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Is there something on your mind?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Thinking he&#39;s read my faint gaze, a sense of nervousness runs through me as if
            grasping my heart.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Who was here?&quot; It is not as if I can speak of such a thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is only natural that he sensed what was in my mind, but, Naoe-sensei did not
            particularly press further.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Ayanokoji, how long have you been working under me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I have been humbly studying under you for 4 years now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;That&#39;s right. There are only a handful of people who can become a
            politician in their 20s. There&#39;s no mistaking it, I can say that among the have-nots, you&#39;ve climbed
            up the stages of success in life faster than any-one else.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The have-nots. A word created by Naoe-sensei, indicating the people other than the
            second or third generations that I hate, i.e. other than the people who are born in a blessed environment or
            whose parents are from the business world and have strong backing. So &lsquo;Have-nots&rsquo; basically
            being the people who did not have a blessed environment with rich parents and strong backing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a word that is mainly used with factions, but it would not be too much to say
            that in truth, whether you succeed as a politician or not depends on these two categories of &quot;the
            haves&quot; and &quot;the have-nots&quot;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In simpler terms, it is like a company that is owned and operated by a family
            member.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how excellent they are, an outsider is an outsider. Unless you have a
            surplus of true ability and fortune, the peaks which you can aim for are limited. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no bright future awaiting the have-nots.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, for people like me, the highest point we can reach stops at the world
            of politics. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To aim higher than that, I would have to connect to a second generation and leave it
            to my child. After choosing the best option in this way, I will be allowed to encroach onto a high position
            somewhere in the world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, since there are already many second and third generation politicians vying
            for the few seats available, even if I send my descendant into the world of politics in the future, it will
            not be easy for him to rise up. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The ones who had been sitting in the seats before will then be connected to the even
            stronger fourth and fifth generations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I am really grateful to you, Naoe-sensei. For picking up someone like
            me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You owe everything to your competency. In truth, I&#39;m being helped by you in
            various ways as well.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no meaning in flattery. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it is a path you cannot avoid as a politician.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Rather, when Naoe-sensei praises someone, there is something you cannot welcome so
            easily awaiting afterwards.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;However, among the party, your true ability is not yet
            acknowledged.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Of course. I am very aware of that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter big or small, all of my achievements are being taken by Naoe-sensei.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is only Naoe-sensei in front of my eyes who understands that they are my
            achievements.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m sure that I am nameless for the opposing party too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve guessed what it was about, but, today, we were talking
            about Isomaru.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Isomaru Youkou has been in the world of politics for a long time as the number 3 of
            the Citizens Party.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;He&#39;s grown older too, just like me. There aren&#39;t that many chances to
            attach yourself to the prime minister&#39;s seat, so...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It must have been a discussion to oppose Isomaru, who is a rival presence for
            Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The guys in the faction are very wary of Isomaru. He really is a foe that
            cannot be underestimated, but, if I was asked, I would say he is an easy man to understand. He&#39;s a guy
            who uses nothing but stale methods.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After decades of friendly rivalry, I&#39;m sure that they know each other like the
            palms of their hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I think that the foe we really have to be wary of is not Isomaru.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;In other words...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Ayanokouj, have you ever met Kijima?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Maybe because I saw a back that looked like Parliament Member Kijima&#39;s, my body
            reacted without my noticing it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m hearing nothing but the names of the big-shots today, including Asama-sensei
            who had a meeting with Naoe-sense in the first place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei&#39;s usual, sharp eyes are gazing at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I have seen him many times, but I have not had the pleasure of a direct
            conversation with him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I think that he&#39;s actually our greatest enemy, the one that we must be wary
            of.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Despite being in the same political party, he calls him &quot;enemy&quot; without
            hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is proof that Naoe-sensei, who wants authority, is strongly wary of
            Kijima-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If Naoe-sensei and Isomaru-sensei are the Citizens Party&#39;s shadows, then he is
            the opposite. Kijima-sensei is a young influential man sold as the signboard of the Citizens Party, a person
            who stands under the light and pushes clean policies into the front.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naturally, as the number of party members supporting him have been increasing, I have
            thought that it would be a bit further ahead when he would threaten Naoe-sensei and his allies. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it seemed that he was evaluating Kijima-sensei higher than I expected.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This means that before I could notice, he&#39;s grown to the point of threatening
            Naoe-sensei. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei, number 2, Isomaru-sensei, number 3, and Kijima-sensei, number 4 are
            gathered under Prime Minister Miyako. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">These are the people who will struggle over the seat of the next Prime Minister.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Do you know what is the biggest factor that has brought Kijima up to his
            present post?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&quot;I think he has many achievements, but the eye-catcher has to be the
            &quot;</span><span class="c36 c11">High</span><span class="c2">&quot;, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Advanced Nurturing High School. A facility established to nurture young people for
            the immediate future of the government. Not much has been achieved yet, but a lot is being expected. No,
            it&#39;s better to say that the government is pressing them. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;There is an inseparable relationship between the education of children and the
            development of the country. It is also well received by our supporters. While he is an enemy, I am impressed
            that he came up with such an interesting idea.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without being able to break into the conversation, Kamogawa listened while sweating
            from his forehead. The air conditioner in the room is not too hot, but from the contents of the
            conversation, it is understandable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Somehow, young party members have a blind dedication to him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is a lot of media exposure, and there are many people who have the image of the
            Citizens Party = Kijima. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I thought I&#39;d make sure if you&#39;re one of them or not.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You must be joking. You will always be the only one I will study under,
            Naoe-sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is at least not a lie. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the first place, once you start the path to the Naoe faction, you are not allowed
            to get off the ship. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if Isomaru-sensei and Kijima-sensei&#39;s factions make great strides in the
            next election and Naoe-sensei loses his position, they will have to share the fate of the sinking ship.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But what was the purpose of having dinner with Kijima-sensei, who is such a wary
            opponent? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m curious, but I don&#39;t have time to pay attention to that right now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Actually, today we decided to officially launch a project that we were
            considering behind the scenes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei threw a brown A4 size envelope on the table. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;This project is a serious one that could change my political life. Now that not
            only Isomaru but also Kijima, and the opposition parties are slowly rising, it&#39;s finally time to move
            with it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the sake cup became empty, I quickly poured in hot sake. Naoe, who was living a
            life where things would be filled up when emptied, drank it down in one gulp.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The existence of the project will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the
            election.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&#39;s why the contents of the envelope in front of me are an important matter.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Most of my aides leave in less than six months. I don&#39;t know if it is a
            pure lack of competence, or an inability to keep up with unimaginable hard work. But even though it has been
            four years, you are gaining momentum day by day, rather than faltering. It reminds me of my old
            self.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Thank you very much.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;ll ask you. What kind of politician is an extremely good politician?
            Kamogawa, answer me.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei asked such a question, perhaps as a side-dish for his sake. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;What!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&#39;s a situation where you can&#39;t be silent, but you can&#39;t just give
            a random answer either. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A very good politician will vary greatly from the point of view of the viewer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;He who can answer the wishes of the people... or such, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&#39;s a straightforward answer, but it is an answer, I suppose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only from the public&#39;s point of view, though. It&#39;s an answer that even a
            child could think of, but Naoe-sensei nodded once and then looked at me this time. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;What do you think?&quot; Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Excellent or not, the answer. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I am inexperienced, but I think people like you are the best politicians,
            Naoe-sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei turned his mouth into a smirk, but I quickly continued. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Bad politicians offer tempura to customers who want to eat sushi.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;C-customers? What do you mean..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Customers are customers. Sometimes it&#39;s the people, sometimes it&#39;s
            politicians, sometimes it&#39;s something else.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Politicians do not deal with one particular kind of person. Politicians who cannot
            respond to requests from an unspecified number of customers are a nonsensical existence. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Now that&#39;s interesting. So, continue.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;A good politician makes sure that customers who want to eat sushi eat good
            sushi. Most likely, 30% of politicians can do this...no, I should say 20%.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Politicians who are supported by many people naturally fall into this category.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Isn&#39;t that an extremely good politician? Because you serve the sushi that
            customers want, and you serve delicious ones, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Certainly, this is the limit of what a good politician an ordinary person can reach.
            However, I don&#39;t think this is an excellent politician in the true meaning.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;If you claim to be an extremely good politician, you need more than that. I
            think he is the one who can induce customers who want to eat sushi to be as satisfied as possible by serving
            curry or beef bowls.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Politicians are not people who just respond honestly to requests. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sometimes, even if you can&#39;t answer a request, there are many situations where
            you have to avoid causing the other person to complain. Even with a single bill, there are only two choices,
            of passing it, or not. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The ones who couldn&#39;t get their bill passed will be dissatisfied. That is why you
            prepare a third option that is neither, and suppress both support and opposition. Naoe-sensei in front of me
            has shown such skills many times. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I see. That&#39;s a pretty good expression.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Thank you very much.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At this point, Naoe-sensei&#39;s eyes change to an even more intense and sharp one.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I hope, that one day, you can put that idea into practice with your own
            hands.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One day. One day, huh? It&#39;s been four years now, but it&#39;s a very short time
            for the world of politics. I wonder how many more years I have to continue to build up this foundation
            before that one day will come. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Don&#39;t look so dejected. You are capable. After watching you for four years,
            I can understand that. That&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for a tangible achievement from a young man like
            you.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He took a bite of his side-dish with his chopsticks, and when he had it in his mouth,
            he pointed the tip of the chopsticks toward the envelope. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been &quot;only 4 years&quot;. It&#39;s been 4 years
            already. &nbsp;Isn&#39;t it about time you got some credit for growing so much?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;...does this mean that you are giving me that opportunity?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Many times, I have repeatedly set things up for Naoe-sensei. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The credit goes only to Naoe-sensei, and the misconduct goes only to me. It&#39;s not
            because of simple charity that I repeated this irrational absurdity. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fist resting on my lap naturally clenched strongly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You can see it that way. But, I must have you succeed. Are you
            ready?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Can I wait to see what&#39;s inside? Of course, I can&#39;t say anything like that.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Shortly after I started studying under you, you said something to me. All human
            behaviour is determined by their goals...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but they were the words left by a great man. If I
            fail, my last four years will probably be erased in an instant. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I will serve with all my heart.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Bowing deeply, I readily agreed to accept. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;If you succeed in this project, fame will naturally follow.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t trust him at all, but he has never even made such insinuations before. It
            is reality that at least it is a different project than the ones before, and an important one. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is a chance I&#39;ve gained, precisely because I&#39;ve gained his trust. I
            won&#39;t miss it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Look it over.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I picked up the brown envelope on the table and pulled out a stack of papers about 5
            mm thick. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The title of the first page is &quot;Human Resource Development Plan
            (temporary)&quot;. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Japan&#39;s education levels are declining. In today&#39;s Japan, it is
            necessary to provide education with an eye on the next 5 or 10 years, not the next 20 or 30
            years.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It is my first time hearing that you were so passionate about education,
            Sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Politicians put a lot of effort into education. Even if you are not interested
            in the slightest, it will lead to votes at home and abroad.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man doesn&#39;t really want to change Japan&#39;s education. He&#39;s just
            coming up with a strategy to strengthen his power and gain more support. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The idiot next to me is fidgeting and worrying about the details of the project.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You can participate too, Kamogawa. Do it together with Ayanokoji.&quot; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;T-thank you very much!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A happy smile broke out on his face, and Kamogawa peeked in somewhat
            forcefully.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There&#39;s no need for someone like this to help me, but if Naoe-sensei decided so,
            then it can&#39;t be helped. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The human resource development plan, briefly summarized, was to provide education for
            gifted children as soon as they were born. After reading everything, I had Kamogawa read the text over
            again. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;How about it? Do you understand, Kamogawa?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;An educational institution under the direct control of the government... and
            it&#39;s from infancy, right? I&#39;ve never heard of it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The questions that spring up from the head of Kamogawa are meaningless. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;We can&#39;t call it a special program if you had heard of it,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without needing me to correct him, Naoe-sensei readily dismissed him. That&#39;s not
            the problem with this project. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;You need to have a little more flexible mind, Kamogawa.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry...&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;However, there is something I would like to ask you, because you are such a
            rookie. How did this project look to you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;How... how did it look?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Glared at by the snake, no, without even having his eyes turned towards him, Kamogawa
            stiffened. He looked like he was about to cry and asked me for help. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Sensei wants to know what you thought when you saw this project. He is not
            looking for a superficial approval, just answer whatever you want.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he were to make a comment that would make Naoe-sensei look bad, it would only
            spoil his good mood. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, then... I was just wondering... are there really any parents who want to
            leave their children in institutions to educate them? Unless it&#39;s a kidnapping... it doesn&#39;t seem
            like a feasible story, does it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Hearing this, Naoe-sensei looked at me, as if testing me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s a valid question. Can you answer that question?
            Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Dumb answers that might be acceptable from a newcomer are not acceptable from me.
            Once I adjusted my breathing, I turned to Kamogawa. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;That will be handled somehow. Every year, there are hundreds of children who
            are abandoned by their parents immediately after birth.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Procuring a baby is no trouble. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Abandoned children are not at risk for their lives, receive generous support
            from the government, and receive appropriate education. It&#39;s a project that makes it easy to go to high
            school or college.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;No doubt about that. Yes, the answer may be the same, but if the steps leading
            to it are not, they will look very different. You have to study hard under Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Y-yes!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Depending on how things unfold, this could lead to an approach to mothers. In
            this Japan, where fertility is decreasing, more than 100,000 abortions are performed annually. It could be a
            satire for a society that doesn&#39;t readily allow childbearing, and also a receptacle for it.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei nodded with a smile and carried the sake into his mouth again. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;And if this plan works, of course, the political community will be very
            interested.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Apart from the lives that we throw away, there are many other lives that cannot
            be treated justly. Especially for the wealthy.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Hidden children, unrecognized children, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes. There are many celebrities who make children in secret. However, they
            can&#39;t provide proper education because they can&#39;t support them publicly. If the government was to
            support them secretly, I&#39;m sure their eyes would light up.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Little by little, I was able to see the full extent of this project. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And, eventually, there will be people who want to give their loved ones the
            best education.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So this is the human resource development plan project that Naoe-sensei is thinking
            about. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Receive funds from the wealthy and educate the children whose identities are to be
            hidden. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Eventually, when the children reach adulthood, they will be thoroughly trained to
            become a member of the Naoe faction, and sent to the political world. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Obedient servants with special education. Moreover, the children will have the blood
            of the wealthy. Is this the beginning of a forward-looking plan? It may seem like a rather dangerous plan,
            but if it succeeds, the payoff is immeasurable. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;If I refuse to accept the offer, I will be immediately removed from the ladder
            by Naoe-sensei. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The people on this list are...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;They are geniuses banished from their paths. They&#39;re hard to handle,
            but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There were about 10 documents, each one with a biography like a resume. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;They were the best in economics, psychology, and other fields in Japan and the
            world, but they left the stage because of some problems.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I see. This human resource development project incorporates various risks. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When it comes to providing semi-mandatory education to children, there will naturally
            be some budding objections. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In that sense, it is unlikely that an authoritative celebrity will move forward and
            cooperate. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the other hand, those who have problems but are proven to be competent are more
            likely to agree to the project if they are given money.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They seem to have many problems with their personalities, but they certainly seem to
            have the right skills. Without knowledge and experience, education can only be done vaguely. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it would not be realistic to take a group of people like private tutors and
            turn them into representatives of Japan. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is by no means an easy job. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Do you remember? Soon after you came under me, you said something about
            education.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Of course. My philosophy of education is to get kids interested in politics, to
            get them to learn about it, and to develop a strong political mindset. That will lead to the future of
            Japan, so I asked to study under you, Naoe-sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I thought it was just a clever little nonsense from a rookie parliament member
            right after I heard it, but it eventually gave me an idea of my own. In other words, you deserve to
            participate. Will you do it? Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is not a word of confirmation. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is no different from any kind of coercion or order. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then the minimum requirement is still the same this time, which is to accept the
            offer with two words of encouragement. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Above all, it is the best project that sublimates and embodies my philosophy of
            education.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Of course, I will take this on.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;This is a top-secret project. Not only the opposition parties, but we are also
            not at the stage of informing the ruling party. &nbsp;Further, there are ethical issues involved. If you
            expose yourself to criticism at the halfway point, your political life will be over.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It will only end my political life, not that of Naoe-sensei, who conceived this
            project. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, to be precise, it will result in several people hanging themselves, including
            Kamogawa II beside him. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We will do our best. However, I have a favour to ask,
            Naoe-sensei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I know this might sound stupid, but I want to speak up now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;This project seems difficult for me and Kamogawa alone. Could you bring in
            someone we can trust?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;That is my intent, of course. There is a man named Sakayanagi who has a good
            face in the political and financial world. He is a young man, not much older than you, but he has a tight
            mouth and is trustworthy. We can try him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;ve heard that name before, but I&#39;m sure it was an old man who was entrusted
            with high school education... </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But either way, I suspect he is a man with the support of Kijima-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I was a little short of words. The Sakayanagi you&#39;re thinking of has a son.
            It&#39;s him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I see. &nbsp;Is he not a person directly connected to Kijima-sensei? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Understood.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Then I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s important, but don&#39;t expect any financial
            help from me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Huuh? Such a project would cost a lot of money-&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I grabbed the shoulder of Kamogawa, who spoke superfluously, and stopped him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I know it requires a certain amount of recklessness, but... may I borrow your
            name, Naoe-sensei?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;That&#39;s not possible right now either. It&#39;s not a good idea to divulge
            what I&#39;m involved with.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Realizing we will not get any support, Kamogawa&#39;s complexion turned pale. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, good luck, Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He speaks very selfishly. &nbsp;But if we do not swallow this absurdity, we will not
            be able to move forwards. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;We are sincerely committed to this project.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if this was just an idea, and a plan to throw away tomorrow... &nbsp;If this is
            what Naoe-sensei wants now, I will have to respond to it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, after a few moments of equally gratifying words to no avail, the meeting was
            closed. In order to see Naoe-sensei off, I took the initiative to open the door of the room. At the end of
            the hallway, the new bodyguard was waiting for Naoe-sensei to return. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh, right. Was it your first time meeting this man, Ayanokoji?&quot; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s exhausting work to be your bodyguard, so I thought that it is not
            unusual that they are being replaced.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man in front of him is constantly looking at us with a smile on his face. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;May I introduce myself?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I showed no particular interest, the bodyguard said so. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Normally bodyguards are not allowed to make such comments, but Naoe-sensei did not
            seem offended. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He sounded thin-lined, but Naoe-sensei, seemed to value him. It&#39;s not just
            anybody. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;He&#39;s called Ayanokoji, he&#39;s a promising parliament member. There&#39;s
            no harm in greeting each other.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A man with a straight, beautiful posture stepped up to me and held out his hand.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;My name is Tsukishiro Tokinari. &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not a bodyguard,
            but I&#39;m happy to make your acquaintance.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I grasped back the offered hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;So you are not a body guard... Then who are you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, this guy is... He&#39;s a jack-of-all-trades, to put it simply. If you
            have any trouble, you can rely on Tsukishiro. He&#39;s not much older than you, but he&#39;s a pretty useful
            man.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Jack-of-all-trades?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if he had been waiting for me, the man who introduced himself as Tsukishiro
            offered me his business card.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I will do whatever is necessary, from personal protection to information
            gathering.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So that&#39;s what he means by jack-of-all-trades. He&#39;s a shady man. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, if Naoe-sensei is walking with him like this, there is no mistaking the fact
            that he has the talent.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I am Ayanokoji, I have the honour of being trained by Naoe-sensei. If there are
            any problems, I will definitely ask you to lend me your strength.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;He has a certain amount of clout not only in the Citizens&#39; Party, but also
            in the Peace Party.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Peace Party, the first opposition party. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is an organization that is always hostile to the Citizens&#39; Party.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just before I became a politician, they even almost won an upset election against the
            Citizens&#39; Party. If it hadn&#39;t been for Naoe-sensei&#39;s conciliation with the Peace Party, the
            regime might have been turned upside down. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you belong to one side, you are hostile to the other side. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whether politician or not, it is universal. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, he&#39;s saying he has influence on both sides?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro walked out with Naoe-sensei, with an eerie smile on his face the whole
            time. I put Naoe-sensei in the taxi that he had been waiting for, and kept my head down until I couldn&#39;t
            see the car. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Wow, it&#39;s cold. I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s looking anymore,
            but..?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Still, I keep my head down for at least a minute after I can&#39;t see the car.
            And don&#39;t let up and look tired after the bowing is over. You can&#39;t know where there are
            eyes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even the people in the restaurant spy on us. After Naoe-sensei leaves, if it was
            spread around that one was using abusive language and such, that would be the end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;But why was Naoe-sensei in a taxi today? And he was in the taxi, so openly
            getting close with a girl, right? Before even the age difference, it&#39;s an affair, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;I guess that&#39;s why he&#39;s called a jack-of-all-trades.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Eh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, I don&#39;t know the specifics either. However, if one dares to think of a
            reason, it is because Naoe-sensei himself is acting as a decoy to lure something out. I can think of
            something like that. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s not what we should care about. Let&rsquo;s Face the human resource
            development project.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is always the case that things are unfolding horribly behind the scenes that we
            know nothing about. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s a great project, but... it&#39;s all getting a bit crazy, isn&#39;t
            it?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is true that it is an outrageous project. However, it seems like a blunder for
            Naoe-sensei to let Kamogawa talk to him as well. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man is light-mouthed and has no convictions whatsoever. He thinks I should see
            this guy by my side? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine while the plan works, but, when it
            doesn&#39;t&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, Naoe-sensei isn&#39;t a man who can&#39;t see that kind of thing. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Should I see this man as being by my side in case I fail?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Details are scarce, but it appears I have no choice but to start off in troublesome
            shackles.</span></p>
