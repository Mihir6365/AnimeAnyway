        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Sunday, the day after the discussion with Kanzaki and the others, and
                        after
                        experiencing a little friction with Kei.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was time to meet Ichinose, whom I had promised to meet with the previous
                        day.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went down to the lobby a bit early, but didn&rsquo;t see Ichinose in the
                        area.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought there was a possibility of bumping into her by chance, but that
                        didn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turned around and looked at the elevator, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be moving
                        either.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess Kei wouldn&rsquo;t follow me after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Kei was concerned about my meeting with Ichinose, she might have done
                        something
                        like that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it&rsquo;s premature to assume that she won&rsquo;t do anything yet. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s a possibility that she&rsquo;s already on her way, or that
                        she&rsquo;s
                        even there ahead of me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or, she might boldly walk in during my meeting with Ichinose. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Analyzing her past behaviour, the probability of that cannot be reduced to
                        zero.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that happens, I&rsquo;ll just have to stand my ground, but&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the way she looked yesterday, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll take any
                        reckless
                        actions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It takes a certain amount of courage to stand up and look at something you
                        don&rsquo;t want to see.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I left the dormitory. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sky is clear right now, but unfortunately, it&rsquo;s predicted that it will
                        rain
                        in the afternoon, so I brought an umbrella.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wonder how Ichinose felt this morning.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does she wish for, what does she want? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s more than one thing. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be an excellent leader, to win in love, to be psychologically strong. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would take both hands to count her desires.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night of the school trip alone didn&rsquo;t bring about any concrete change
                        in
                        our relationship.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had no way of knowing what the unstable Ichinose was thinking without meeting
                        with
                        her in person.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I arrived there a little before the appointed time while thinking about
                        what&rsquo;s ahead, Ichinose was already waiting for me with an umbrella behind her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She noticed me before I called out to her, and slowly waved.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;G-good morning, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t feel a heavy atmosphere. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anything, there is a fresh and innocent sense of tension. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike the surprise visit that night, Ichinose has prepared herself for the
                        public.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first time I looked at her, she looked back at me, but when I kept looking to
                        understand her intent, she averted her gaze right away. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can tell that she dropped her eyes to my mouth, nose and neck while trying not
                        to
                        be noticed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I forced you to meet with me today.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal. I didn&rsquo;t have any plans today anyway.
                        Really.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the one who invited her, I&rsquo;m grateful to hear that. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if she&rsquo;s only being polite. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was still a few minutes before Keyaki Mall opened, so we lined up at the
                        entrance.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;re next to each other, but the distance between us isn&rsquo;t too close
                        nor
                        too far. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a third party who doesn&rsquo;t know anything, it would be difficult to judge
                        whether we are waiting together or separately.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not often that I come here before the store opens, but
                        there&rsquo;s no one here yet, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s especially cold today, so. I guess everyone&rsquo;s still
                        relaxing
                        in their dorms.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s true. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless it&rsquo;s a special sale day, there&rsquo;s no need to wait in line for a
                        mall to open early in the morning. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It really is cold out here. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose quietly muttered so, repeating her words. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conversation stopped there, as I figured that we would talk after entering
                        the
                        building.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My daily routine of spending time with Kei, my lover, has been increasing.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That daily routine is not always full of conversation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometimes, we stay silent for 10 or 20 minutes while still sharing each
                        other&rsquo;s
                        company. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt the same awkwardness as I do now at first, but before I knew it, it
                        disappeared and I even began to feel comfortable with the silence sometimes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn&#39;t a problem of getting used to it or not, but rather a problem of
                        feeling awkward in the time spent in silence with someone that you are neither close nor distant
                        with.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not that I couldn&rsquo;t stand the continued silence, but I think I
                        should be the one to start a conversation as the side who invited her. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Ichinose was also thinking the same thing. However, neither of us could
                        start
                        speaking and take the first step.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A common topic of conversation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something that you keep playing catch with two or three more times after opening
                        the
                        topic. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I thought about that, a male student came up in my mind.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, I was in the same group with Watanabe in the school trip
                        earlier.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know him before as I had no point of interaction with him,
                        but
                        Watanabe was a friendly, easy to talk to and nice guy.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I honestly told Ichinose what I thought, she was pleased as if I was talking
                        about her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. I think all of our classmates like him, both boys and
                        girls.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He doesn&rsquo;t easily get carried away like Ike, and he can read the room, even
                        if
                        not as well as Yousuke can. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve only spent a little time with Watanabe, but I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s
                        the
                        same in his class too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studying at the same place for two years, but
                        there&rsquo;s so
                        much I don&rsquo;t know about other classes.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same for me. I don&rsquo;t know much about other classes,
                        even
                        though I think I do. It&rsquo;s very different from primary school or even middle school&hellip;
                        I guess
                        it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re really competing with each other.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">People show their weaknesses to each other and help each other out in normal
                        friendships. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this school however, that concept of normalcy doesn&rsquo;t apply. This is the
                        impression that most students have, including Ichinose.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;People are hard to deal with. Even with my classmates, I still can&rsquo;t
                        say
                        that I&rsquo;m getting along well with them. I think it&rsquo;s really amazing that you can make
                        friends so
                        fast, Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I&rsquo;m definitely not amazing or anything like that.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather than being modest, it seems that she is unaware of her own skills.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there a trick or something, then? A way to get along with
                        everyone?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how much I learn about building friendly relationships, I&rsquo;m still
                        far
                        from being the best at it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I haven&rsquo;t acquired the skills that people like Ichinose and Kushida have. I
                        know what I need to do.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know what to say, and I know the words.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, I can&rsquo;t be like them. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The slightest difference in the atmosphere in the place or body language can make
                        a
                        big difference in the outcomes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; I wonder if there is such a thing. Even if there is, I
                        don&rsquo;t
                        think I&rsquo;d know.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a natural skill that she possesses, so she is unable to break it down
                        into
                        theoretical pieces and explain it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So even if one tries to learn this skill by watching, it&rsquo;s no easy thing to
                        absorb it and use it well. It&#39;s like a verbal catch-ball that somehow continues.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before long, the automatic doors opened at 10 p.m.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we entered Keyaki Mall first, we were covered in the warmth from the heating
                        inside.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How long can you stay today?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any plans after this, so as long as we
                        want.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to ask Ichinose a few things today, so this is a great chance. If I
                        limit
                        the time, we may not be able to converse well.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I want to know the reason she quit the Student Council, and there&rsquo;s also
                        the
                        important subject Kanzaki and the others asked me about. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s very convenient that I was able to secure enough time to fulfill
                        Kanzaki
                        and the others&rsquo; requests.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But&hellip; &nbsp;I do feel a sense of strangeness.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;ve put the romance aspect aside for a moment, but Ichinose isn&rsquo;t
                        fundamentally an insensitive person.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if she doesn&rsquo;t have a first-class sense of her surroundings, her
                        perception is better than the average student.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wouldn&rsquo;t be able to work as a leader if it wasn&rsquo;t so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even in her current psychological state, she is likely to know how she is viewed
                        by
                        her classmates from the way they look at her and from their words and feelings.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In which case, it isn&rsquo;t a good idea to decide that this was a coincidental
                        opportunity.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure she was able to guess the intent behind my invitation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Depending on the conditions, she may have guessed that her classmates are hiding
                        behind my intentions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should be prepared for that today.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what are we going to do?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My secret intent is to gather information from her, but she doesn&rsquo;t know my
                        outward intention yet.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s the conclusion I came to after thinking about my plan to share some
                        time
                        with Ichinose today.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a clear goal in mind, but&hellip; Right. Can you show
                        me
                        how you spend your days off?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How do I spend my days off?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I want to learn the kind of daily life you live that lets you become
                        friendly with everyone.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Can you really understand that from something like
                        this?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just said what came to mind, but&hellip; No good?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought I would put a second plan into motion if I was refused, but Ichinose
                        nodded
                        without showing a displeased expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can help you, but if you&rsquo;re okay with that,
                        then
                        let&rsquo;s do that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems to have thought about it positively, so she consented.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like my first step was effective for now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, then&hellip; So we really can do whatever I do on my days off,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Shopping, movies, cafes, I&rsquo;ll follow you with
                        anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I might not meet your expectations, though. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That doesn&rsquo;t apply to anything I&rsquo;ve said, but Ichinose
                        laughed.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked a bit awkward when we met up in the morning, but she&rsquo;s now
                        showing
                        me a natural smile.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose said so and we headed for the second floor in an escalator.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.qsh70q"><span class="c20">Part 1</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are various commercial facilities in Keyaki Mall, and I&rsquo;ve already
                        visited most of them. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there are still a few that I haven&rsquo;t experienced yet.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of them is the training gym on the second floor.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I try to come here on the weekends. I&rsquo;m a bit clumsy, so I&rsquo;m
                        hoping to improve that a little.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We reached the gym and Ichinose took out her student card.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go to any gyms, right, Ayanokoji-kun?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ve never been in one.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is perfect, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;m a bit surprised. How long have you been coming
                        here?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I came here for a free trial in September, and became a member in
                        October.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she&rsquo;s been coming here for two months already. I had no idea.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you start by yourself? I&rsquo;m not good with places like this,
                        but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure one gets used to it after a while, but the first one or two times
                        would be very hard.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the same. That&rsquo;s why I started with my friend. I was
                        scared
                        when alone, but I can do a lot better when someone else is with me. We can hang out here a bit
                        today,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded and let Ichinose lead me into the facility.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose greeted the friendly staff woman at the reception desk, and started
                        talking
                        about me while showing her student card.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have your student card?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like you can easily get a free trial without filling any forms if you
                        show
                        your student card.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you in a bit then, Ayanokoji-kun. The staff will explain everything to
                        you
                        from here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, a male trainer took over and explained how to use the lockers and to
                        change clothes, the showers rooms etc. before I was asked to change.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that this gym allows people to go in empty-handed without bringing in
                        any
                        luggage.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After taking off my clothes by a locker and changing into the rental training
                        wear, I
                        headed for the training room at the back of the gym.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Ichinose still hasn&rsquo;t finished changing her clothes, so I
                        couldn&rsquo;t see anyone else.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The place just opened, so I suppose it&rsquo;s only normal.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I was a little troubled by the fact that I was the first here. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A male trainer offered to teach me some things, but I refused. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I came all the way here, so I thought it would be better if I learned from
                        Ichinose.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not knowing how to behave however, I just looked around at the equipment. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was familiar with the training equipment itself, so I didn&rsquo;t feel too
                        uncomfortable. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had all of the newest equipment available in the White Room in order to train
                        my
                        body.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the makers or the year of the equipment were different, they all seemed
                        high
                        quality.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was thinking about all this, the gym surprisingly started getting filled up
                        with
                        students. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it would be a little more quiet, but this place is quite
                        popular.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting, Ayanokoji-un. Ah, it looks like the boys are
                        already starting.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose came out into the training area after changing her clothes, and I agreed
                        while being a little surprised at her outfit.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There were two or three girls in the women&rsquo;s locker room
                        too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see adults around too, so I guess non-students can use this place
                        too?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew that this place wasn&#39;t exclusively for students from places like the
                        movie
                        theatre or the supermarket, so it looks like this gym is no exception either.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see Mashima-sensei here a lot as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see. The teachers are no exception either. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the people living inside the school facilities, a place to train your body is
                        very important.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve long shied away from facilities like this, but if there are familiar
                        students like Ichinose here, I may be able to imitate them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was thinking about such things, Ichinose began explaining the
                        equipment.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She explained both by words and by showing me in practice. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I made sure not to tell her that I don&rsquo;t need any explanations, and quietly
                        listened while pretending not to know anything.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose had already acquired a certain amount of knowledge, but she was still a
                        newcomer to the gym and didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to use everything that well.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After about 10 minutes of instructions on how to use the equipment, the number of
                        students in the gym gradually increased and about seven men and women excluding us started to
                        sweat it
                        out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We should get started too- Ah, good morning Mako-chan!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as we were about to get started, Ichinose called out to someone she
                        knew.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, ah, Honami-chan!?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Amikura, who had just come out of the locker room after changing.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was surprised to see us, especially since I&rsquo;m here too with Ichinose
                        today.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-why are you in the gym?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must have been so restless that the question on her mind leaked out from her
                        mouth.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I started going to the gym on my days off, right? I thought I should
                        introduce
                        Ayanokoji-kun to this place as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure she didn&rsquo;t expect to see the two of us here in the
                        gym.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose cannot understand Amikura&#39;s feelings on this subject, so I ended
                        things
                        off with a normal expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s about it. Sorry to bother you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re bothering me or anything,
                        but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura gave me a look that said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say anything
                        unnecessary&rdquo;.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By that, she would mean the time we met up at the karaoke the other day. I
                        won&rsquo;t talk about that, of course. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not sure how effective it will be, but I also gave her the same
                        look.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange to see you in a gym, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never imagined you doing something like this, or rather I thought you
                        hated
                        crowded places.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would like to say that she is wrong, but she&rsquo;s right. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had some resistance to the idea of working out in front of the general
                        public.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also had an image of the gym as a place to hang out with friends rather than to
                        work out in silence, so it was very difficult for me to consider going to one.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have to admit that I had been staying away from them for that reason.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, can we chat a bit, Honami-chan?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura noticed something and pulled Ichinose by her arm.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, the two started whispering to each other. For some reason, their mouths are
                        turned away from me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...!?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose jumped with surprise and hid behind Amikura for some reason.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice that, Honami-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura who replied so, was also somewhat embarrassed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What..?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, no, umm&hellip; I&rsquo;m a bit embarrassed because I&rsquo;m not used
                        to
                        this kind of clothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked at me as if saying that I should already realize what happened.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, she was embarrassed that a boy saw her in her gym clothes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The characteristics of the gym mean that you&rsquo;ll be moving around and
                        sweating a
                        lot however, so there are inevitably some restrictions on what you can wear. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s better not to bring the concept of embarrassment into a gym.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose had not noticed this reality, but it seems Amikura made her
                        notice.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was easy to see the expression of failure on Amikura&rsquo;s face at her
                        blatant
                        reaction.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a person of the opposite sex, I understand that she may be concerned, but this
                        is
                        a gym.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d like her to remember that it&rsquo;s best not to worry about such
                        things.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to sweat, right? Tell me all about it, I want to try
                        everything.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to get her to think about something else. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like Ichinose made her resolve with these words.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s right. Umm&hellip; What should we do then,
                        Mako-chan?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she&rsquo;s still in a bit of a panic, so she asked Amikura for
                        help.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two whispered to each other again, then nodded at the same time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still beginners, so maybe we should start with something
                        familiar
                        like a treadmill?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine with that, of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two got on their treadmills and put them on the mode they wanted. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The maker and such are different, but I&rsquo;ve been using these since I was a
                        child, so there&rsquo;s nothing to be confused about for me. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a necessary exercise machine for in-doors training.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose and Amikura had mostly the same settings, so I matched mine with
                        theirs.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your first time in a gym, isn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t force
                        yourself, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura said so in a caring manner, but I told her that it&rsquo;s okay with a
                        light
                        wave of my hand.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, we started quietly training on treadmills for a while.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose couldn&rsquo;t get over her nerves and embarrassment at first, but she
                        seems
                        to have forgotten it over time, and after 30 minutes she was completely normal.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we used the treadmills for 30 minutes, Ichinose and I looked at each other
                        when
                        the treadmills stopped.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phew&hellip; I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s already said that she&rsquo;s not good at exercise, but she seems to
                        be
                        even more exhausted than Amikura and deeply sighed while stretching her shoulders.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna get some water.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying so, Ichinose asked us for permission and left. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I do remember seeing a machine for water bottles in the locker room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura and I were left alone on the spot, so I decided to chat with her a
                        little.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reached your level after only a little time, huh.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. You had the same program as us, but you don&rsquo;t seem tired
                        at
                        all.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Boys are stronger than girls on the physical level, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;m still surprised, though. I had imagined that we might see
                        each other in Keyaki Mall, but I didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d meet here in the
                        morning.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like Amikura was surprised by our meeting here as well.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So? Did you get anything from Honami-chan?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing yet. We came to the gym right after meeting up, then ran into
                        you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. She looks like she&rsquo;s having a lot of fun,
                        though.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura happily said so while wiping her sweat with a towel.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess friends can notice that about each other.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. She always smiles anyway, but it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s
                        having an
                        explosion of smiles today.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that we are alone after Ichinose has left, in order to fulfill my promise to
                        Watanabe, I&rsquo;ll try to pull out some information here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about to be christmas already, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep. You&rsquo;re gonna spend it with Karuizawa-san, right?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asked me first before I could ask her the details.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? Well, I guess so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip; This is going to be sudden, but what do you intend on doing
                        with
                        Honami-chan?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean, you know about her feelings, right? Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps hesitating to express this so openly, Amikura said so in an evasive
                        way.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think I should do?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? You&rsquo;re asking me!?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought you had something in mind, since you&rsquo;re the one who asked
                        first.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wiped away the sweat from her neck with a worried expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip; As her friend, what I want most is to see Honami-chan smile. But
                        you&rsquo;re with Karuizawa-san right now. I think it would be wrong to go as far as seperating
                        with her.
                        The best thing would be for Honami-chan to love someone else and become happy with
                        him.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached to such a conclusion while thinking in her own way about what would
                        be
                        ideal.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s troubling for Ichinose to show feelings of
                        affection
                        towards me right now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if she turns those feelings towards an unrelated third party, things would
                        instantly be solved.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s not like I know a lot of other boys, but
                        Watanabe is easy to approach, and it seems like he would get along well with
                        Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going along with Amikura, I put out Watanabe&rsquo;s name here to see what
                        happens.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Depending on her reaction here, I may be able to tell what Amikura&rsquo;s
                        impression
                        of Watanabe is.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura appreciates Watanabe enough to go shopping with him on her day
                        off.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Watanabe-kun, right? From my class?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. We stayed in the same room during the school trip, so I had a lot of
                        chances to talk with him. Wouldn&rsquo;t he be a good fit for Ichinose?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I guess so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she had to think a little.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s ambiguous whether or not she thinks favourably towards him.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Personally, I think Honami-chan could go for someone a little
                        better.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re saying Watanabe is out of Ichinose&#39;s
                        league.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say anything bad about Watanabe-kun though, okay? I
                        just
                        think he&rsquo;s a normal guy.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. By the way, what about you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s being unclear, so I decided to quickly step into her territory.
                        Ichinose
                        might come back if we take too long here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem to know a lot about romance.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. It&rsquo;s always been one-sided for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow. So there is someone you like?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah. I am a high schooler, after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who is that? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to learn the most.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a crush on someone for 5 years now. When am I going to move
                        onto someone else, I wonder?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She muttered as if talking to herself. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">5 years. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it&rsquo;s a love that has been continuing since before she
                        entered
                        this school. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that there is no need to press this any further, but I don&rsquo;t know
                        if
                        this is good news or bad news for Watanabe. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps I could say that it&rsquo;s a good thing his rival isn&rsquo;t in this
                        school, but&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to learn what type of person he was, at least, but Ichinose returned
                        from
                        getting water. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can&rsquo;t let Ichinose learn that we have been talking about her feelings,
                        so
                        Amikura quickly took some distance from me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry I kept you waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay. All good?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It won&rsquo;t help me if I keep pushing Amikura now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll ask Ichinose about it again later if I ever get the chance to.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.3as4poj"><span class="c20">Part 2</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I continued experiencing the gym with Ichinose and Amikura for another hour after
                        that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just before we were about to finish, Amikura intentionally said that she would
                        remain
                        here for a while and that Ichinose and I should meet her at the reception desk after changing
                        our
                        clothes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the meantime, I received a pamphlet from the gym to consider officially
                        joining.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a pain to have to spend a few more thousand points each month, but
                        it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to sweat it out once in a while.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I haven&rsquo;t done much voluntary exercise here for the past two years,
                        I&rsquo;ve confirmed again that my abilities have deteriorated to an extent that is incomparable
                        to when I
                        had just enrolled. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve reached the conclusion that I need to improve them a certain
                        amount.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose and I changed clothes and left the gym, and returned to the mall.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You took a pamphlet?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seriously considering joining the gym.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; I guess we can see each other more often then.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her routine shouldn&rsquo;t end with just the gym, so I asked about what was
                        ahead of
                        us.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I visit the bookstore a lot. I also go to the general store. I want to
                        rest a
                        bit today though, as I&rsquo;m more tired than usual. Should we sit for a moment on a
                        bench?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it&rsquo;s the same training, you will expend more physical power when
                        your
                        environment changes. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s important to take a rest when you need to instead of forcing yourself
                        to
                        stick to your routine.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to go to a cafe?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. I mean, I think we&rsquo;d stand out too much,
                        and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she was being considerate of me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you for thinking about me, but I don&rsquo;t mind. We can go to a
                        cafe
                        if you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really? If it&rsquo;s okay with you, I&rsquo;m fine with it
                        too.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, it would seem more suspicious to clumsily try and avoid being
                        seen.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two people having tea or something in a cafe is a regular everyday scene, even if
                        they are the opposite genders.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It just makes it feel special when you put too much thought into things.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We went to the cafe, urging each other to be mindful as usual. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a matter of consideration, we chose the cafe on the second floor, instead of
                        the
                        more crowded cafe on the first floor.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We each got a drink and sat around a table.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it okay if I ask you something, Ayanokoji-kun?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ask me something? Of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does the reason you invited me here today have anything to do with me
                        resigning from the Student Council?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asked with some restraint, but it seems that Ichinose was almost sure about
                        this.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose it was easy to infer when I suddenly invited her here on a
                        weekend.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would be a lie to say that has nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Thanks for replying honestly.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s averting her gaze as usual, but she smiled a little after saying
                        so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was surprised about you resigning too. I thought that you had a good
                        chance
                        of winning in the election against Horikita.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One has to consider Ichinose&#39;s character, abilities, and the fact that she
                        has
                        been contributing to the Student Council from early on in year-one. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita on the other hand joined the Student Council later than Ichinose, but
                        considering the fact that her brother was the Student Council President, and the fact that she
                        has momentum
                        in the B Class, they would be evenly split.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who would you have supported if there was an election? What&hellip; What a
                        stupid question, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaving aside likes or dislikes, Horikita is currently in the same class as
                        me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the betterment of the class, here&rsquo;s a big merit to someone from our
                        class
                        becoming the Student Council President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I personally had a flat way of thinking on it. I didn&rsquo;t feel that it
                        was
                        necessary to support Horikita just because she&rsquo;s in my class. If Nagumo had picked
                        Horikita, I would
                        have been fine with supporting you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was just honesty, but Ichinose probably took it as flattery. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked happy, but also seemed to be feeling a little sorry.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&hellip; You couldn&rsquo;t have won if you did that. I&rsquo;m no
                        match
                        for Horikita-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Ichinose didn&rsquo;t feel like she could beat Horikita, even before actually
                        fighting her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, rather than a difference of ability, that is a loss on the psychological
                        side of things.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that I resigned, since things ended without me embarrassing
                        you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t know how the match would have turned out.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That makes me very happy to hear. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You had already decided to resign from the Student Council before that
                        though,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it because of what happened on the school trip? If
                        so&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She interrupted me and firmly denied it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s almost bending the paper cup in her hand.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was already thinking about it before that. That I wasn&rsquo;t fit for
                        the
                        Student Council. I have no real abilities, I&rsquo;m not popular, and most of all&mdash;&mdash;
                        I have a
                        past that can&rsquo;t be erased.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose&rsquo;s face looked just like it did back on the school trip for just a
                        moment, but she didn&rsquo;t start crying this time. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she doesn&rsquo;t want to continue whining.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, you know&hellip; It&rsquo;s not like I gave up on everything. There
                        are
                        people in my class who worry that I&rsquo;ve given up on rising to A Class, but that&rsquo;s
                        wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to continue aiming for A Class?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not brave enough to take the first step, I can lend you a
                        hand. That&rsquo;s what you said to me. After hearing that, I made up my mind that night on the
                        school
                        trip.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose then looked at me, and laughed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can still fight. But, I didn&rsquo;t want to fight two fights at a time.
                        I
                        could have chosen to continue remaining in the Student Council, but I thought that would just
                        cause me
                        unnecessary worry.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s the reason she reached the point of resigning from the Student
                        Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah&hellip; But I guess the school trip may be the cause of me quitting the
                        Student Council after all, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laughing after exchanging a light joke, Ichinose closed her eyes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quitting the Student Council, and what I have been thinking until then.
                        Next
                        week, I&rsquo;m going to tell my classmates everything that I&rsquo;ve told you. I don&rsquo;t
                        want anyone
                        to misunderstand me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there are misunderstandings among her allies, it will become a hindrance to
                        their
                        confrontation against the Ryuuen&rsquo;s Class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can accept that everything she&rsquo;s told me here are her true
                        thoughts.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a great strength that she was able to self-digest over time from the
                        stage
                        up to the unstable school trip.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She lost her role in the Student Council, which was one of her weapons, but what
                        she&rsquo;s gained is even greater than that. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that the situation I had feared is over, even if
                        temporarily.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think this will make up a good report for Kanzaki too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, right. This is completely unrelated, but there&rsquo;s something I
                        want to
                        ask you. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I want to try and help Watanabe out here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you know what type of boy Amikura likes?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose froze up with the cup in her hand.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze which she had been averting up until now is completely glued to my eyes.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s almost so much that I&rsquo;m the one that wants to avert my gaze
                        now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you ask something like that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice is the same. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She doesn&rsquo;t look angry.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, something&rsquo;s strange.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seems the same, but I feel that something has strangely changed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well&hellip; There&rsquo;s not really any reason, I was just
                        wondering.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just curious? You want to know the type of guy Mako-chan likes without any
                        reason? That&rsquo;s definitely unlike you in any way you look at it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would normally be the end of it, but the mood keeps getting heavier and
                        heavier.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether I like it or not, I&rsquo;m having a hard time coming up with something
                        to
                        say.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I can&rsquo;t openly hint at Watanabe&rsquo;s existence here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought about it when we were together during the school trip too, but
                        Amikura is pretty cute, and she seems popular too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm, I know Mako-chan is cute. So? What does that have to do with her
                        type?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. That&rsquo;s very unlike you, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said the same thing again.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">More importantly, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like she&rsquo;s going to look somewhere
                        else.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where did the peaceful mood that was here up until now go to?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the cup next to her mouth, Ichinose continued pressing with an unchanging
                        expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So why do you want to learn Mako-chan&rsquo;s type?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not really any specific&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Reason?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess there has to be. I am asking, after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stopped meeting eyes with her, and averted my gaze to a worker in the cafe.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah, I guess they just got an order, because they&rsquo;re making some kind of
                        chocolate drink.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you meet up with Mako-chan somewhere before me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her pursuit continued, regardless of the fact that I averted my gaze.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your eyes met in a strange way when we ran into each other at the gym
                        today.
                        Like you were talking with your eyes?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she&rsquo;s this convinced, awkwardly denying it would only make the
                        situation
                        worse.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you noticed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I did. I mean, I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m always watching you,
                        always thinking about you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Ichinose&rsquo;s gaze separated from me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must have noticed that she just said something embarrassing.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is my deduction, but&hellip; Mako-chan and everyone else in the class
                        must be worried after I resigned from the Student Council. So they asked you for help, right? To
                        see how I
                        was doing?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose proved that she has a firm grasp on the situation, as if proving that
                        she
                        has mentally recovered.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Impressive. You&rsquo;re correct.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I almost want to clap, but I&rsquo;ll refrain from that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, I don&rsquo;t get it. Why do you want to know the type of guy
                        Mako-chan
                        likes?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She inferred that I was talking with her somewhere before, but it&rsquo;s
                        understandable that she can&rsquo;t connect it to the reason I was asking about what type of the
                        opposite
                        sex she likes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll ask if she can make a guess. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather, this is the only method I have left to hide Watanabe&rsquo;s existence.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be best to come up with a suitable answer from Ichinose&rsquo;s own
                        suspicions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re curious about her or anything. Mhm, I
                        would hate that, so I won&rsquo;t think about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She put it out as an option, but then erased it herself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, it was a very bold thing to say, even if it&rsquo;s just the two of
                        us.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s still in love with me and has no intention of hiding it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or, was she not thinking about this that deeply?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t see what Ichinose&rsquo;s true intentions are through the thick
                        fog.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s something other than that&hellip; There&rsquo;s someone that
                        likes Mako-chan, and he asked you for help. Mhm, that would make sense. Maybe you thought I
                        would know the
                        answer.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s almost scary how on the mark she is.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Basically, a boy that knows about my relationship with Mako-chan, and has
                        contact with you. If he&rsquo;s in my class, that would be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;ll be honest and confess.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sorry, Watanabe. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clumsily trying to trick this perceptive Ichinose won&rsquo;t work here.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was about to say the name in the next second if I hadn&rsquo;t stopped
                        her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boy who likes Amikura, and he asked me to investigate for
                        him.
                        But, I can&rsquo;t tell you who he is. That&rsquo;s what I thought, but I guess it was a bit
                        one-sided.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am not saying that the act of indirectly exploring the likes of the opposite
                        sex is
                        a bad act.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Amikura&rsquo;s standpoint however, it&rsquo;s a different issue whether
                        this is
                        a joyful thing for her or not.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry. Please forget about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. It&rsquo;s only natural that someone would
                        want to
                        know more about the person they like, and I know it&rsquo;s very difficult to ask them directly,
                        no matter
                        how brave you are. Mako-chan is a very nice girl. I honestly don&rsquo;t know the type she
                        likes. I never
                        asked her, so. But, from what I can tell, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone in this
                        school she
                        likes.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The meaning hidden behind those words is that there is someone outside of this
                        school.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This also connects with the talk I had with Amikura earlier.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like there was a student in the same class who she liked in
                        middle
                        school. I don&rsquo;t think they ever dated, but I think she&rsquo;s still not over him and
                        hasn&rsquo;t
                        liked anyone else.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This probably wasn&rsquo;t what Watanabe had in mind. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may be a surprisingly high hurdle to keep thinking about a person of the
                        opposite
                        sex for a long period of time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean Watanabe doesn&rsquo;t have a chance. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he can build a good relationship with her now and in the coming year, he
                        should
                        still have a good chance.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is all I can tell you, but is it any useful?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough. Thank you, Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-kun, I see Watanabe-kun has come to rely on you a lot
                        too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never said it was Watanabe.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, right. Sorry, sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The biggest reason for my defeat is that I have too few social relations, rather
                        than
                        the fact that I mentioned his name in the morning.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.1pxezwc"><span class="c20">Part 3</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, we enjoyed Keyaki Mall for a while.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather than shopping as Ichinose said, we just looked around some stores
                        aimlessly.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a half day of her really showing me her routine. When it was about time
                        for
                        lunch, we left Keyaki Mall together.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining already?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I won&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s raining heavily, but it looks like it&rsquo;s
                        been
                        coming down for a while.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We both had umbrellas with us, so we put them up and started walking.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry I made you keep me company today.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no. Now I know that there are people who really care about
                        me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whole reason I invited Ichinose here was to get information from her. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would completely understand if she was angry.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she didn&rsquo;t curse me, and rather expressed her gratitude.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for thanks. I should have been more upfront about it
                        instead of going around and around.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop it. That&rsquo;s the whole reason&hellip; that we were able to spend
                        time
                        together.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose muttered so while blushing.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Karuizawa-san get mad? You told her about today, didn&rsquo;t
                        you?
                        I bet she didn&rsquo;t like you spending time alone with another girl, no matter what the reason
                        was.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose is worrying about Kei, which is at odds with her own feelings.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is she being sincere, or is this just courtesy?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You may be right.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Water splashed around as we walked over puddles on the way back home. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">An unexpected silence. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike the morning, the heavy feeling has lessened.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can I ask something? Did you confess to her? Or did she confess to
                        you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s waiting for my answer.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t give her the answer she wants.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I confessed to her.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re the one that liked her, huh&hellip; I&rsquo;m so
                        jealous.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the past, I would have never thought that I would have this kind of
                        conversation
                        with Ichinose. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose walking next to me, however, seems to have the composure to accept my
                        answer.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Usually, this would mean that I&rsquo;ve paid off my debt to Ichinose for her
                        feelings. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn&rsquo;t hubris, but looking at things calmly, it&rsquo;s clear that
                        Ichinose
                        still has strong feelings towards me. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wonder how her mental condition is right now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is she just bluffing? Or is she in a state of resignation?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not sure which one it is. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Strangely, Ichinose&rsquo;s eyes seemed to have more sparkle in them right after
                        asking about Kei.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t misunderstand anything, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t go very smoothly. I explained everything properly, but she
                        was
                        still angry.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. I can explain the circumstances to her, if you&rsquo;d
                        like.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing for you to worry about. It&rsquo;s my responsibility
                        for
                        failing to explain things properly.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, the cold war may continue for the time being.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence returned, and continued until the end.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We got onto an elevator that came down when we finally reached the dorms.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Today was a lot of fun. Thanks, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I got off after reaching the fourth floor, and she waved goodbye to me.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you later, Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We waited for a few seconds while looking at each other until the doors
                        closed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few seconds, Ichinose was out of sight.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went back to my room and contacted Kanzaki via a chat app to make a
                        report.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I informed him that Ichinose has not given up hope of getting into A
                        Class.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finished typing that the reason she quit the Student Council was so she could
                        focus
                        more on the fight in the future, and that she would make her resignation known to the public
                        tomorrow.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After my report, I received a message from Kanzaki asking if she really meant
                        what
                        she said.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As far as I could see, there was no falsehood in her words.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most importantly, I was able to catch a glimpse of an unusual aggressiveness that
                        I
                        had never seen from Ichinose before.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It remains to be seen whether this will be a good or a bad thing, but I have a
                        feeling that I will be seeing a different side of Ichinose than what I have seen in the
                        past.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told her that while I will watch over her, she should get more friends with
                        whom
                        she could express her opinions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps a little relieved for the moment, Kanzaki sent me a message of deep
                        gratitude.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;? No contact from Kei?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could have told her that it was over, but we&rsquo;ll see each other in school
                        tomorrow anyway.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will be enough to make my explanation at that time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I decided to leave things as they are and not contact her today.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
