    <h3>Part 3</h3>

    <p>
        My first lunch-time after the winter vacation’s end.

    </p>
    <p>Kei is already heading to the cafeteria with Satou and the other girls.

    </p>
    <p>She’s also paying attention to her friends instead of only focusing on her partner.

    </p>
    <p>It’s very important to do so.

    </p>
    <p>I entered the corridor and watched Kei from behind for a while, noticing how cleanly the group was lined up.

    </p>
    <p>“Why do girls always walk side by side even when there’s 4 or 5 of them together?”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t know either. Lining up like that is just disruptive behaviour.”

    </p>
    <p>I tried asking Horikita who was standing behind me, but she didn't seem to understand either.

    </p>
    <p>“More importantly, do you have eyes on your back too? How did you notice me?”

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe we should just leave that mystery unsolved?”

    </p>
    <p>“So you’re not going to tell me?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll think about it if you tell me why girls always line up side by side like that.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s mean, you know Horikita-san can’t answer that question. She doesn’t have enough friends to line up with.”

    </p>
    <p>Kushida also showed up after Horikita.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s a caste system. It’s necessary to keep the group cohesive even if it means blocking the corridor.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. So they’re making sure they can walk around however they want.”

    </p>
    <p>“Probably. It’s not like they’ll say it, but I’m just guessing that’s the reason.”

    </p>
    <p>If so, one might call it a mechanism of mass psychology mostly in effect with females.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s really lame, isn’t it? You should consider others when walking around.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yes yes, of course the girl with no friends would say that.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you trying to pick a fight with me?”

    </p>
    <p>“Do you really have to ask? Don’t make me laugh.”

    </p>
    <p>The two glared at each other with fire in their eyes.

    </p>
    <p>“Please don’t do that here. Do you want something from me?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yes, actually. Ayanokouji-kun, would you let me treat you to lunch today?”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita treating me to lunch? I can’t find many good images about that in my memories.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s always something bad going on when you say that. I can guess that based on my experiences.”

    </p>
    <p>“How rude. You’re going to eat for free, and I’m not going to talk to you about anything weird. Does that put you
        at ease?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well… I suppose.”

    </p>
    <p>I think she’d get angry if I told her it doesn’t put me completely at ease, but I’ll just be quiet and nod here.

    </p>
    <p>“He had to think pretty long, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t like it when he does that, but it’s fine. Are you ready, Kushida-san?”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm, I’m all good.”

    </p>
    <p>She quickly switched from battle-mode to angel-mode.

    </p>
    <p>“I see you invited Kushida as well. That’s quite rare too.”

    </p>
    <p>Did Horikita invite me along because she doesn’t want to eat with Kushida by herself?

    </p>
    <p>That’s what I thought for a moment, but that’s not a good enough reason for this setting.

    </p>
    <p>There has to be a hidden reason for inviting us two together.

    </p>
    <p>What is she thinking?

    </p>
    <p>Kei isn’t with me today, so I suppose there’s no harm in going along with this, anyhow.

    </p>
    <p>“So? Are we going to the cafeteria?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, let’s just find some other place. Someplace calm and quiet without a crowd.”

    </p>
    <p>I looked at Kushida walking beside me after Horikita’s reply and noticed her hands were empty.

    </p>
    <p>So, are we going to stop by a convenience store to pick up bento lunches or something?

    </p>
    <p>I’m still not sure, but I’ll find out soon enough so I just stood up and started walking in the corridor with the
        two.

    </p>
    <p>The three of us didn’t line up side by side, of course; Horikita took the front with me and Kushida lined up a
        little behind her.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, Horikita-san. I just want to ask again, but are we really going to eat?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s what I said, didn’t I? We’re going to eat.”

    </p>
    <p>“Right… Can we stop by a convenience store first, then? I need to buy stomach medicine.”

    </p>
    <p>“Please stop. I understand why you feel uneasy, but there’s no need for that.”

    </p>
    <p>I see, so we’re going to buy stomach medicine at a convenience store on the way. Because it’s necessary.

    </p>
    <p>“Wait a bit. What do you mean stomach medicine? Just what are we going to eat?”

    </p>
    <p>It’s clearly strange that she wants to buy something like that before lunch.

    </p>
    <p>I asked Horikita why, and she quickly answered without turning back.

    </p>
    <p>“We’re eating Ibuki’s handmade bento.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Ibuki’s handmade bento?”

    </p>
    <p>I focused on my thinking for a moment and tried to come up with a calm measure.

    </p>
    <p>“She made a bento meal for the three of us today. So we’re going to divide it evenly and eat together. Didn’t I
        say that before?”

    </p>
    <p>“You definitely kept that hidden on purpose..”

    </p>
    <p>I would have run away like a frightened rabbit if I heard that at the beginning.

    </p>
    <p>I can assume that she certainly didn’t make that for me. Even surprises should have a limit.

    </p>
    <p>“If my memory serves me correctly, Ibuki wasn’t a great cook, was she?”

    </p>
    <p>I purposefully refrained from using the word ‘bad’ and pushed down my fear.

    </p>
    <p>“She’s the type who hasn’t ever cooked for herself in her life. So her diet is very unbalanced. That’s still new
        in that vague memory of yours too, isn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>We were on winter vacation until now, but I had bumped into Horikita, Kushida and Ibuki just after the new year.

    </p>
    <p>I do remember coincidentally hearing something about that back then.

    </p>
    <p>“Unbalanced diets are bad for your health, so I invited her to my room a few times recently and let her eat the
        meals I cooked for her. She was saving food on money, so she came without fail even while grumbling about the
        food.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not annoying-cute when someone keeps coming even though they’re complaining, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>Wouldn’t that be exactly what one would express as ‘annoying-cute’?

    </p>
    <p>“You seem to know a lot, despite disliking Horikita and the others.”

    </p>
    <p>“I was with them too, since I thought I might get to see a fight or something.”

    </p>
    <p>Just as expected of Kushida, she had very unpleasant expectations.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s why I was stuck making three servings of food including my own.”

    </p>
    <p>Despite her complaints, Horikita didn’t seem that bothered by the situation.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps she is already used to it by now.

    </p>
    <p>“Anyway, after a while of that, Ibuki insisted that we eat her cooking too.”

    </p>
    <p>“Because of Horikita-san. She kept showing off her cooking skills, and Ibuki had to boast she could cook too,
        since it was so easy. Why don’t you try it, then? Oh, I will, so get ready! You should die if you can’t do it. I
        should kill you if I can do it well, then. And now, we’re here.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s interesting how easy it was to imagine that flow of events.

    </p>
    <p>The last two exchanges are probably made up, though. At least I hope they are.

    </p>
    <p>“Alright, I understand what’s going on. I’ll go to the cafeteria then, so see you later.”

    </p>
    <p>I turned away at a crossroads to try and get away, but Kushida, of course, grabbed my arm.

    </p>
    <p>“How nice, huh? You get to eat food prepared by someone who, biologically speaking, is a girl.”

    </p>
    <p>“You tricked me.”

    </p>
    <p>I vented my resentment to Horikita, who was calmly walking ahead of me.

    </p>
    <p>“It sounds bad when you put it like that. I just want as many people as possible to get to eat Ibuki-san’s
        cooking. It’d be weird to drag in people who aren’t close with her though, right? Besides, it’s too early to
        assume that the food will be bad.”

    </p>
    <p>From our conversation just now, it certainly doesn’t look like she’s looking forward to it herself. I see that I
        cannot get away, so it looks like I have to give up and follow her.

    </p>
    <p>“But, you could have gotten away any time, couldn’t you, Kushida?”

    </p>
    <p>I understand that she went to Horikita’s room to eat her cooking, but the risk is still too great, no matter how
        much she wanted to see a Horikita vs. Ibuki. She couldn’t know what kind of tragedy awaited her.

    </p>
    <p>“I guess, yeah. I have my reasons too.”

    </p>
    <p>“You just hate to lose, don’t you Kushida-san? You’re only coming because you think you’ll be a coward if you run
        away from Ibuki-san, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“...I just want to see Ibuki fail and apologize.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like Horikita was right on the mark since Kushida didn’t use an honorific for Ibuki, but will Ibuki
        really apologize even if she does fail?

    </p>
    <p>Well, maybe it’s because of her nasty personality that she’s accepting any little hope of seeing Ibuki apologize
        even if it is a low probability.

    </p>
    <p>“She’s not here yet, huh? It’s almost time for our meeting, so…”

    </p>
    <p>We stopped in front of a corridor leading outdoors, which is apparently the meeting spot.

    </p>
    <p>Horikita tricked me by saying she wants to go to some place that is uncrowded, but she was planning on dragging
        me into this from the start.

    </p>
    <p>“You know, there was no need to meet up here since our classrooms are so close, was there?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s true that this is a pointless rendezvous, but I did invite Ibuki-san to walk with us, you know? She just
        refused because she didn’t want to walk together with us.”

    </p>
    <p>If she hates Horikita (and probably Kushida) so much, she could have just refused to do this.

    </p>
    <p>This is a good example of what happens when you’re too stubborn to accept a loss.

    </p>
    <p>“She’s just going to fail and come here with a bad tasting bento box, anyway.”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t want to make assumptions on the result, but I’m sure she did fail at first.”

    </p>
    <p>“I bet… So am I going to be forced to eat a failed meal now?”

    </p>
    <p>“Stop talking about failures!”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki suddenly interrupted the awkward atmosphere with a shout and approached us.

    </p>
    <p>In her hands, she has a bomb… no, she has a bento box.

    </p>
    <p>That’s not what I wanted to see in her hands.

    </p>
    <p>I wanted her to say, ‘I forgot, so it’s canceled!’ I would have supported her.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s Ayanokouji doing here? I didn’t invite him.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s fine, isn’t it? The more judges there are, the more truthful our judgement of the cooking will be. Now that
        we’re all here, let’s go somewhere else. You don’t want anyone thinking we’re friends either, do you?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course not!”

    </p>
    <p>So we went out through the corridor.

    </p>
    <p>The cold weather is still quite bad as it is early January, but that’s also why we managed to find an empty
        eating spot with no one around.

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki raised what appeared to be a bento box wrapped in a simple plain cloth, (like the ones I’ve seen in 100-yen
        shops) and slammed it down on the bench.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m going to make you regret talking about me failing, just eat already.”

    </p>
    <p>“Full of confidence, are we? Did you happen to prepare something good by some miracle?”

    </p>
    <p>She really is filled with confidence.

    </p>
    <p>It’s much better than not having confidence, but should I really expect something good?

    </p>
    <p>“She’s clearly the over-confident type, so you shouldn’t trust her attitude.”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita was already well-versed on the subject and looked down on the bento box after moving her gaze away from
        Ibuki.

    </p>
    <p>Simultaneously, Kushida and my faint expectations dissipated like a fading mist.

    </p>
    <p>“Hmph. I wouldn’t have come here if I thought I was going to lose.”

    </p>
    <p>“I can see that you’re confident, but you shouldn’t have slammed the food down like that. Even if your food is
        well-made, you’ve failed as a cook.”

    </p>
    <p>“Just shut up and eat. Then apologize to me, Kushida! Then, you next, Ayanokouji!”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t put me and Kushida-san together. What kind of grouping is that?”

    </p>
    <p>She said my name right after Kushida’s, but I’m not bothered.

    </p>
    <p>It’s just that… “You three are pretty friendly now, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>This is a disastrous scene no matter which way you look at it, but that’s the contradiction here.

    </p>
    <p>“We’re not friendly, why do you think she’s mistaken about that, Ayanokouji-kun?”

    </p>
    <p>“She’s right. Don’t interpret this in such strange ways.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll beat you up if you say something like that again!”

    </p>
    <p>One of us is clearly more agitated than the rest, but I’m definitely out-of-place here in regards to us being
        friendly with each other.

    </p>
    <p>“Should I leave?”

    </p>
    <p>I genuinely don’t want to get in anyone’s way, but…</p>
    <p>
        “Don’t leave!”
    </p>
    <p>“Don’t try to flee.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s low, Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>I received three different replies with the same meaning.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t really get it, but I suppose I can’t flee now so I’ll sit down.

    </p>
    <p>Well, it should be fine. I’m a little interested to see what will happen.

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki is still barely even a novice cook.

    </p>
    <p>She probably went through a lot of trial and error to make Horikita and Kushida admit defeat despite that…
    </p>
    <p>
        With some anticipation, this is because of the bento box’s appearance, which is an important element of any
        dish. A plain bento box came out of the wrapping cloth. (I also saw this at a 100-yen shop)

    </p>
    <p>“Let’s open it, then.”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki looked arrogant without showing any signs of anxiety or worry.

    </p>
    <p>She slowly opened the lid. What came out was…
    </p>
    <p>
        The first thing that caught my attention is the rice.

    </p>
    <p>It’s Chinese style fried-rice instead of white rice.

    </p>
    <p>It’s fair to say that it still retains the appearance of a bento lunch.

    </p>
    <p>“Did you make this all by hand?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course.”

    </p>
    <p>She gave an instant answer, which seems to be honest, but I’m still surprised to see boiled food here.

    </p>
    <p>“I think I’ll be generous and give you 30 points for the appearance.”

    </p>
    <p>“Taste is what matters with food, not appearance.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m trying to compliment you. I was expecting to give you close to 0 points.”

    </p>
    <p>She haughtily told her that even 30 points was a high score.

    </p>
    <p>Horikita seems to have brought a few chopsticks with her for this occasion, so she handed me and Kushida ours as
        well.

    </p>
    <p>“Let’s begin with the taste test.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s my first time doing such an unenthusiastic taste test~ What a nice memory~”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita also wanted to be the first to split her chopsticks, and Kushida waited for her to eat first.

    </p>
    <p>Horikita grabbed some of the fried rice with her chopsticks and put it in her mouth.

    </p>
    <p>Then, she also grabbed a piece of gratin and ate it as well.

    </p>
    <p>Kushida spoke up after Horikita quietly finished eating.

    </p>
    <p>“How is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Not yet. I don’t want my impressions to affect you two. It’s your turn next.”

    </p>
    <p>“Tsch.”

    </p>
    <p>Come on… That tongue click was way too obvious.

    </p>
    <p>If a student who still holds illusions about Kushida in their mind saw this, they would probably faint.

    </p>
    <p>Though if one was listening from the side, they’d probably think it was accidental instead of done intentionally.

    </p>
    <p>“Can I just eat the mini tomatoes?”

    </p>
    <p>“Take this seriously.”

    </p>
    <p>“Tsch. You’re so annoying.”

    </p>
    <p>Another strong tongue click from Kushida.

    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, it was even louder than the previous one.

    </p>
    <p>She unenthusiastically chose the fried rice and mini-hamburger, and started eating.

    </p>
    <p>“Ah… I see. Okay, Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>Kushida handed me the baton with a convinced expression on her face.

    </p>
    <p>What shall I do now, then?

    </p>
    <p>There are 7 types of food including the mini tomatoes.

    </p>
    <p>Those two ate 4 of them, so I suppose it would be best if I tried the remaining 2 except the mini tomatoes.

    </p>
    <p>In other words, the fried egg and deep-fried food. Life and death, or perhaps death and death.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll start with the fried egg, then.”

    </p>
    <p>A staple of bento meals.

    </p>
    <p>It takes real talent to make it right, but it’s simple enough to prepare.

    </p>
    <p>My first instinct is to be wary of eggshell contamination as I ate some.

    </p>
    <p>However, it effortlessly went down my throat. Time for the deep-fried food.

    </p>
    <p>I only noticed when I grabbed some with my chopsticks that they were mouthful sized round croquettes.

    </p>
    <p>I put some on top of my tongue while keeping my guard up.

    </p>
    <p>I bit into it and the contents showed their face.

    </p>
    <p>I could instantly tell by the taste that it’s a croquette when I started eating it.

    </p>
    <p>However, what drew my attention more is the squishy texture.

    </p>
    <p>The water contents of the ingredients weren’t removed, and it was under-fried.
    </p>
    <p>It also felt bad on my tongue and left an unpleasant aftertaste.

    </p>
    <p>I finished eating, put my chopsticks down and closed my eyes.

    </p>
    <p>…Mhm, I see. Chew, swallow, and the answers come out by themselves.

    </p>
    <p>“We’ve all finished eating, so I’ll start with my honest impressions. It doesn’t taste good.”

    </p>
    <p>“Huuh!?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not as if it’s inedible, and the appearance isn’t so bad that it merits a score 0 zero either. I can see
        that you tried very hard for your first time, but I can definitely tell you used too much salt while not paying
        attention to the seasoning.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s right, the food definitely isn’t inedible.

    </p>
    <p>The seasoning Horikita mentioned is probably too thick because it was done by eye.

    </p>
    <p>“I know you can eat carrots without peeling them, but they taste bad and their sizes are inconsistent. You
        probably tried to group them up but I can see you just ignored some of them.”

    </p>
    <p>She just ate a little from one bento box, but she’s already inferring what Ibuki was thinking as she was
        preparing it.

    </p>
    <p>Further, it’s clear from Ibuki’s bitter expression that most of what she’s saying is true.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t want to eat any more. I guess this is what they mean when they talk about wasting a meal.”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki’s shoulders shivered with anger because of Kushida’s spiteful words and attitude.

    </p>
    <p>“I can’t believe you were saying you could beat Horikita in cooking. You should have just paid a good cook to
        prepare this for you instead.”

    </p>
    <p>I’m inclined to pity Ibuki after all this scathing criticism, but it can’t be helped as this is the quality of
        the food she brought.

    </p>
    <p>“You’re not even judging it partially, are you!?”

    </p>
    <p>“You should eat some too, then. You never properly taste tested it anyway, did you?”

    </p>
    <p>“Taste test? No, but… It looks normal, and it’s edible isn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>“I never said it’s inedible. I’m just saying it doesn’t taste good. Come on, eat some.”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki looked annoyed after having her own bento pushed on her and grabbed a pair of chopsticks.

    </p>
    <p>“...Yeah, it doesn’t taste… No, it’s delicious… It’s incredible!”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t force yourself to lie.”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki groaned after Horikita smacked her on the head.

    </p>
    <p>“Why doesn’t it taste good!? It tastes so lame, and it’s so salty!”

    </p>
    <p>“I explained everything, didn’t I? You can’t do everything yourself without any calculation.”

    </p>
    <p>“I just thought it would be annoying to care about one or two more tablespoons, and that it wouldn’t even make
        any difference!”

    </p>
    <p>That’s a big problem.

    </p>
    <p>The side dishes packed in the bento box are noticeably inconsistent, either too thinly seasoned or not at all, or
        too spicy.

    </p>
    <p>“If I’m to give you a number score for this meal, it would be 20 points.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Out of 20 points?”

    </p>
    <p>“Out of 100 points.”

    </p>
    <p>“Huuh? You’re a bought judge!”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m still being nice to you. I wouldn’t even want to eat this bento meal.”

    </p>
    <p>“You’re right. I think I’ll give her 2 points.”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki protested vehemently and stamped her feet on the ground after the scathing assessment of the judges.

    </p>
    <p>“You’re gonna say the same things too, right? Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, I think that this bento lunch isn’t something that can’t be eaten, and my score will be higher.”

    </p>
    <p>“Alright! Let me hear it!”

    </p>
    <p>Very happy that she finally found a supporter, Ibuki faintly jumped up.

    </p>
    <p>“Have you lost your mind? This is a strange, badly made bento meal.”

    </p>
    <p>“Agreed with no further additions.”

    </p>
    <p>Kushida quickly agreed with Horikita without further elaboration, but I’m going to stir the pot here.

    </p>
    <p>We should all give our differing opinions on this bento lunch from differing viewpoints.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not something that can’t be eaten, though. You admitted that as well, didn’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s… Yes, I suppose. I still don’t want to eat it, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“You certainly wouldn’t want to eat this in your daily life of satiation, but what if you were on a deserted
        island? You would eat it with delight if you had nothing else there, wouldn’t you? That’s how I gave it a score,
        which is…”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t care about the score. Thanks for the analogy, which was both easy and hard to understand. At least I can
        tell that you’re not trying to compliment me.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh…”

    </p>
    <p>She interrupted me as I was about to tell her my score, which feels vexing and unpleasant.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps the food in my stomach is causing indigestion.

    </p>
    <p>“11 points on average. How unfortunate, Ibuki-san.”

    </p>
    <p>They shouldn’t have invited me if they weren’t going to include my score in the average…

        It’s already over, but the only thing this leaves me with is an unfortunate sense of lacking closure.

    </p>
    <p>“Ugh…”

    </p>
    <p>This is the result of Ibuki going out of her comfort zone and cooking for the first time, so her only choice also
        is to just accept this.

    </p>
    <p>“I can make some time for you if you’d like to try again, though?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m never doing this again!”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki shouted with dissatisfaction after facing repeated criticisms for her first time cooking and losing all
        motivation.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not a bad thing to give up early. You’re not currently cut out for cooking.”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki was criticized again, but perhaps having stopped caring now, she just snorted and crossed her arms.

    </p>
    <p>“Actually, I just realized the ones who bother cooking are the stupid ones. You were wasting your time.”

    </p>
    <p>“What do you mean by that?”

    </p>
    <p>“You can just buy a bento lunch at a convenience store or a supermarket instead of cooking for yourself. It saves
        time and you don’t have to deal with extra ingredients. They taste good too. Right!?”

    </p>
    <p>Well, that’s certainly the role of lunch boxes, but…</p>
    <p>

        “That’s no good. You have to keep nutrition in mind. Are you going to make me repeat that over and over again?
        This is why you don’t grow.”

    </p>
    <p>“Ahahaha, yeah. Leaving her soul aside, her body isn’t growing at all either.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, Kushida! Who are you talking about?” “Who do you think?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll kick you down right now! I’ll kick you down and make you beg for forgiveness!”

    </p>
    <p>“Yes yes, don’t get offended so easily. Lack of nutrition is also why you’re so grumpy, you know. Come to my room
        at 19:00 today.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, I’ll be there!”

    </p>
    <p>Really..? I thought she’d say no, but Ibuki accepted the invitation despite her annoyed expression.

    </p>
    <p>She can eat nutritious, delicious food while saving on food costs.

    </p>
    <p>There’s a disadvantage to letting Horikita scold her, but I suppose she can’t throw away such a good deal so
        easily.

    </p>
    <p>“Later!”

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki spat out those words and left with quick steps.

    </p>
    <p>Her footsteps were so loud that she’d make her lower floor neighbors angry if we were in an apartment.

    </p>
    <p>“Wow, she didn’t even clean up the bento box she brought here herself.”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita tidied up the lunch set while grumbling like a mother complaining about her child’s poor manners.

    </p>
    <p>She’ll probably bring them back and wash them.

    </p>
    <p>Kushida, who was sitting next to us, then looked away and stood up.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll be there at 19:00 too, then.”

    </p>
    <p>“...I didn’t invite you, though?”

    </p>
    <p>“Come on. I want to save on private points too, even if only by a little. It doesn’t sound that bad to eat food
        that was sourced by your money, Horikita-san. I’ll enjoy the flavour.”

    </p>
    <p>She seems to enjoy the food’s taste in a completely different manner than others.

    </p>
    <p>“You’ve saved up plenty of private points too, haven’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not enough. I was supposed to receive money from a certain person every month, but there was a surprising
        change of plans.”

    </p>
    <p>She smiled warmly for a moment, then turned her cold eyes towards me.

    </p>
    <p>Then, she entered her usual angel mode again and disappeared towards the cafeteria.

    </p>
    <p>“That brings this to an end, then. Good work.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, good— No, wait a bit.”

    </p>
    <p>I firmly told Horikita to stop just as she was quickly taking the bento box with her.

    </p>
    <p>“What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think making me eat a bad tasting bento meal counts as treating me to lunch, do you?”

    </p>
    <p>“Why don’t you just eat all of the bad testing bento meal?”

    </p>
    <p>She pointed at the bento box, indicating that there’s still plenty left, and firmly replied.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m kidding. Let’s go to the cafeteria now. I’ll treat you to whatever you want.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like Horikita still has a hint of conscience left in her.

    </p>
    <p>“Still, Ibuki and Kushida, huh? It can’t be cheap to feed them, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“I have to spend almost double what I usually do on food. Kushida-san comes over even if I don’t invite her.”

    </p>
    <p>“You and Ibuki are probably a good way for Kushida to vent her stress, right?”

    </p>
    <p>If Kushida really doesn’t like being with them, then I don’t think she’d eat with them even if it was just for
        free food.

    </p>
    <p>“Who knows? She loves things that damage me above all else. Maybe she just wants to see me work with an exhausted
        face that badly, including Ibuki.”

    </p>
    <p>I see. That might be the truth as well.

    </p>
    <p>Kushida might be able to catch a glimpse of Horikita’s weak points if they spend enough time together.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s hard to imagine, but maybe you do have fun when the three of you are together?”

    </p>
    <p>“No such thing. It’s not like a normal girls gathering you’d think of. There’s never a single laugh, and the mood
        is actually very nervous. You saw how it was just now, didn’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>Looking back on that, I definitely can’t say it was a fun time. Kushida was the only one who showed one or two
        smiles, maybe because of her habits, but even those were way fewer than when she spends time with other people.

    </p>
    <p>However, strangely, she didn’t look very strained, and actually seemed to be doing fine.

    </p>
    <p>“Let’s go, then. It’s a waste of time to keep talking about those two.”

    </p>
    <p>“Let’s go.”

    </p>
    <p>We started walking.

    </p>
    <p>I started thinking about today’s minievent.

    </p>
    <p>Ignoring the burden on my tongue and stomach, I think the gathering was a worthwhile endeavour.

    </p>
    <p>Horikita, Kushida, and a student from a different class; Ibuki.

    </p>
    <p>Their newly built relationship, while warped, is surprisingly solid and hard to underestimate.

    </p>
    <p>They would all certainly frown if one expressed it as friendship, but one could analyze that this is also because
        feelings of friendship are being born between them.

    </p>
    <p>“What?”

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps Horikita didn’t like that I was looking at her as we walked and she firmly squinted her eyes.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m just thinking about what kind of expensive food to get.”

    </p>
    <p>“You should just eat what you want to eat, without thinking about the price.”

    </p>
    <p>“I want to eat the most expensive thing.”

    </p>
    <p>“Good grief… do whatever you want.”

    </p>
    <p>After that, however, she for some reason decided by force which meal I would eat…
