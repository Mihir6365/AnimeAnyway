    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        “Looks like you’re doing something quite spectacular already in the New Year.”
    </p>
    <p>A girl found and called out to us after we quickly arrived at Keyaki Mall and started chatting in the small
        library.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
        It was Kamuro Masumi, with whom I don’t usually have much contact with.

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori approached Kamuro and lightly greeted her with her head, but Kamuro ignored Hiyori and talked to me.

    </p>
    <p>“I just saw you and Karuizawa on a date at the end of last year, though. Did you already start dating a different
        woman this year?”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like the look she was giving me was one of disdain.

    </p>
    <p>Maybe she’s right to think that way after looking at this scene.

    </p>
    <p>“She’s such a different type, too. What are you thinking?”

    </p>
    <p>“Umm, good morning, Kamuro-san.”

    </p>
    <p>“Shiina, yes? I never knew there was something like this going on between you and Ayanokouji.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s going to continue with this misunderstanding if I don’t actually explain things to her.

    </p>
    <p>“He invited me out as a friend today.” “I have permission from Kei.”

    </p>
    <p>I thought she might be a little convinced with that, but she still looks stern.

    </p>
    <p>“Even if that’s true, this is still an unusual sight when you look at it from the outside.”

    </p>
    <p>One can’t tell the circumstances when looking at something from the outside, so she’s justified in that sense.

    </p>
    <p>“If that’s the case, does that mean that a man and a woman can never go out as friends?”

    </p>
    <p>“You can tell by the atmosphere. I could sense that this isn’t normal even when I looked at you two from afar.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s just her own interpretation, so I don’t think she can declare something like that in such a certain
        manner.

    </p>
    <p>I regard Hiyori highly among the female students.

    </p>
    <p>She’s knowledgeable, even if she doesn’t usually show it, she likes reading, just like me, so she doesn’t talk a
        lot.

    </p>
    <p>I could say that I’m on the same wavelength with her.

    </p>
    <p>I can guess that Hiyori also looks at me in a similar manner.

    </p>
    <p>So, that means it’s not unreasonable for someone to assume that we have a relationship that is deeper than a
        friendship.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll be careful and make sure there aren’t any misunderstandings.”

    </p>
    <p>“It would be wise to do so.”

    </p>
    <p>“Did you come all this way to warn me about that?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m just getting started. There’s something else I want to check with you.”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro approached closer without even saying Happy New year to me.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m gonna step into some secret territory, is that okay?”

    </p>
    <p>She made sure to check that I was okay with Hiyori being with us. Hiyori didn’t seem to mind either, so I want
        the conversation to continue.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s okay. If you have something to say, just say it.”

    </p>
    <p>“Okay, then. What’s with your conduct lately?”

    </p>
    <p>“Conduct? What do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t play stupid. I know that you’ve been sniffing around A Class recently.”

    </p>
    <p>“Me, sniffing around A Class?”

    </p>
    <p>I definitely don’t remember that. Sniffing around A Class?

    </p>
    <p>I can only think of one thing that would make her ask me this question.

    </p>
    <p>“Do you mean Morishita?”

    </p>
    <p>“So you do remember. There’s someone who saw you chatting with her.”

    </p>
    <p>That must be when she called out to me for a moment back then.

    </p>
    <p>I guess it’s no surprise that someone was watching from far away.

    </p>
    <p>“Morishita-san?”

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps not remembering that name, Hiyori muttered curiously next to me.

    </p>
    <p>She might not even know that they are in the same year.

    </p>
    <p>“You don’t know? There’s a student named Morishita Ai in A Class.”

    </p>
    <p>“I think I remember her name now that you mention it, but we’ve never talked.”

    </p>
    <p>“She’s not someone who usually talks with people outside her class. It’s suspicious, isn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Is it? She didn’t seem suspicious to me.”

    </p>
    <p>She herself told me that she talked to Sudou and Kouenji.

    </p>
    <p>I’m a bit curious about her using my full name without any honorifics, but she wasn’t poor with her words.

    </p>
    <p>“You weren’t probing into A Class, were you?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s not my intention. It’s up to you whether you believe me or not, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro bluntly told me that she won’t believe me so easily.

    </p>
    <p>“I didn’t think you were the type to conduct yourself with A Class in your consideration, Kamuro.”

    </p>
    <p>“I probably wouldn’t care so much if it wasn’t you.”

    </p>
    <p>“Okay?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s because you’re the one and only person who affects Sakayanagi.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’d never imagine I would hear you say that to me, Kamuro. I was sure that you always hated Sakayanagi.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi discovered her shoplifting, and utilized that fact as a threat to use her as her hands and feet.

    </p>
    <p>She has to be fed up with this way of working with Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>This is different from the image I had in my mind.

    </p>
    <p>“Things change when you eat from the same kettle for a year, I guess.”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t act like you know what’s going on. It’s not as if I like Sakayanagi now or anything. I’m just doing the
        minimum I can to think about the class. I won’t bother you if your presence can be used in a beneficial manner,
        but you have to be dealt with otherwise.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s considering her comrades more than a little.

    </p>
    <p>“Still, you seem to know a lot, Shiina.”

    </p>
    <p>“Know what?”

    </p>
    <p>“Your expression hasn’t changed at all while listening to me and Ayanokouji talk. Am I wrong?”

    </p>
    <p>“Umm, I’m sorry, I wasn’t really paying much attention…”

    </p>
    <p>“...Huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“This is between you two, so I was just blankly looking around. Were you talking about something special?”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro sighed with amazement as Hiyori curiously tilted her neck.

    </p>
    <p>“Not really, no.”

    </p>
    <p>I suppose she decided that she was overreacting.

    </p>
    <p>She wanted to see how Shiina would react, but she missed her mark.

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure Hiyori did hear the conversation, and understood the situation, but she’s someone who can act like an
        airhead and not let others realize she’s not one.

    </p>
    <p>“I know that you’re not normal.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s a violent way of saying it.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s the truth, isn’t it? You couldn’t calmly expel Sakura otherwise.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like she’s speaking with the unanimous special test in mind.

    </p>
    <p>That should only be known amongst the class, but I guess Kamuro somehow got a hold of that information.

    </p>
    <p>“Today, I’m going to-”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro interrupted her remark and looked away.

    </p>
    <p>“Oh. It’s rare to see you two together~”

    </p>
    <p>Just as she was about to get obstinate, Hashimoto in a bright mood and Kitou next to him showed up.

    </p>
    <p>I noticed that Kamuro’s expression suddenly changed at that moment.

    </p>
    <p>Her face showed that she didn’t want to run into these people.

    </p>
    <p>If she wanted to continue speaking like this, she would have to consider Hashimoto hearing her.

    </p>
    <p>Considering that, there may be a different meaning in her change of expression, but what caught my attention was
        Kitou’s bizarre style of clothing.

    </p>
    <p>He’s already declared his ambition to become a fashion designer, so his style is very different from those of
        ordinary people.

    </p>
    <p>“I couldn’t help but burn up with jealousy when I saw Ayanokouji surrounded by beautiful girls like this.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you messing with me?”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro was clearly angry and pressed Hashimoto.

    </p>
    <p>“Shiina-chan and Kamuro-chan, huh? You have a discerning eye, Ayanokouji. Right, Kitou?”

    </p>
    <p>He asked Kitou for his opinion, but Kitou showed no reaction.

    </p>
    <p>“We were just going out as two lonely men, so why don’t you let us hang out with you?”

    </p>
    <p>“As if. I’m leaving already.”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro was about to leave with anger, but Hashimoto grabbed her arm and whispered something.

    </p>
    <p>She pushed him away and immediately made distance, but stopped in her tracks.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not like the two of you are on a date, right? You have a girlfriend anyway.”

    </p>
    <p>I nodded, thinking that things were about to develop the same way they did with Kamuro.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no problem with adding us in and hanging out the five of us then, is there?”

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no reason for me to say no if Hiyori’s okay with it.”

    </p>
    <p>“I think it would be fun. I’d like to talk a little more with Kamuro-san and those two.”

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori replied without showing any signs of unpleasantness.

    </p>
    <p>I guess she’s not the type to take the initiative to talk to others, but she probably doesn’t hate the idea of
        hanging out in a big group like this.

    </p>
    <p>It’s not as if I’m that close with Hashimoto and Kitou either, but it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to deepen my
        friendship with some different people.

    </p>
    <p>“We didn’t really have anything in mind, so can we leave the planning up to Hashimoto?”

    </p>
    <p>“Leave it to me, I’ll make the decisions.”

    </p>
    <p>He’s already used to leading large groups, so Hashimoto agreed without hesitation.
