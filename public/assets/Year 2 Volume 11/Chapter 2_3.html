    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>The game started as soon as the first round of the exchange meeting's information was made public.</p>
    <p>Prior to that, I made the decision to discuss this issue with Hashimoto, who was fiddling with his cell phone in
        the same room.</p>
    <p>Even if I said nothing about playing every game, Hashimoto would still detect something was wrong. It was
        advisable to steer clear of probing and being questioned by fellow group members as it was a waste of time. </p>
    <p>I gave him a brief explanation of our match's contents, but it was still a clash with the previous president of
        the student council, and Hashimoto couldn't contain his amazement the entire time.</p>
    <p>He also repeatedly sighed after hearing what had happened, showing that he understood the circumstances.</p>
    <p>“You consistently accomplish feats that surpass my wildest dreams. You are aware of that, right?”</p>
    <p>“It's not the direction I was hoping for.”</p>
    <p>“Nevertheless, it's amazing that you're up against Nagumo-senpai. It's also about your individual performance,
        not the outcome of this group fight.That is incredible. It is expected of you to win 17 of the 19 games.”</p>
    <p>He thought this would be difficult, but Hashimoto seems strangely content.</p>
    <p>“That merely indicates his interest in you. I knew what my eyes saw.”</p>
    <p>It's still selfish, even if it's just an informal exchange meeting.</p>
    <p>It changes the dynamic among the group. </p>
    <p>I wanted to talk to you about this in order to maintain the group's teamwork.</p>
    <p>“That's where I enter the picture. Though I think you shouldn't be concerned, I can understand what you're trying
        to communicate.”</p>
    <p>“Explain what you mean.”</p>
    <p>“Consider it. Would everyone compete for a chance to play if this was an enjoyable game? Do you really think all
        high school students would want to do flower arrangement and embroidering in order to compete? No.”</p>
    <p>While it seemed that other students weren't as interested, I was.</p>
    <p>“Thus, you ought to feel invited to take part in everything. If all went according to plan, I would be
        delighted.”</p>
    <p>“Are you going to win in the actual exchange meeting? I'm curious about Kiryuuin-senpai's thoughts on it. Given
        the facts, is it reasonable to presume that she’s interested in this?”</p>
    <p>“Well, I'm not sure. She's not as thrilled as Nagumo, but she's not entirely uninterested either. She might even
        give her kouhais the full thing.”</p>
    <p>My record was the only reason Kiryuuin was interested in the match against Nagumo.</p>
    <p>That was all, just taking advantage of the extra amusement before graduation.</p>
    <p>“Even though the private points I earned this time are limited to pocket money, I can make better use of the
        private points I already have. To be really honest, I want to strive for a higher position and win the cash.”
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto's war funds were crucial, as he has alienated people from both the inside and the outside.</p>
    <p>“Well, Ayanokoji, you ought to get along with the freshmen.”</p>
    <p>“Get along, huh?”</p>
    <p>“Do you believe that making friends with first-year students is challenging?”</p>
    <p>I agreed after giving it some thought, and Hashimoto got up and gave himself a whack on the knee.</p>
    <p>“Okay, then, let's try our best to make the most of it. I'll start by settling down with the first-year students
        and attempting to get along with them by tonight.”</p>
    <p>Hashimoto said right away that he had no trouble approaching the first-year students.</p>
    <p>"If Kiryuuin-senpai doesn't move, I'll also try to get as much information as I can at that point, but your power
        is invaluable. Thus, you'll need to work together to get along with the first-year students when it gets dark,
        okay?”</p>
    <p>It was only right that I offered assistance, I couldn't just expect things without providing anything in return.
    </p>
    <p>Supporting Hashimoto, who was trying to win the group, felt like the better choice.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I would definitely do it if I could.”</p>
    <p>However, it would be best to inform him as soon as possible that I lack confidence.</p>
    <p>I believed that, but Hashimoto saw straight through it.</p>
    <p>“Leave it to me. This is the kind of thing I'm pretty good at. Being able to serve as your hands and feet makes
        me delighted. It is something Ryuen cannot ignore, and it will also act as a check for Hime-san.”</p>
    <p>He was advancing with his own interests while simultaneously working with me.</p>
    <p>It was not always a negative thing to be calculating.</p>
    <p>It would be more preferable to approach the problem with that perspective rather than relying just on good
        intentions if there was an obvious conflict of interest.</p>
    <p>“By the way, what would be the reward for defeating Nagumo-senpai?”</p>
    <p>"I'm not sure. I didn't inquire as to the precise figure.”</p>
    <p>“It's not simply a few thousand or tens of thousands, is it, given that he is a third-year representative?”</p>
    <p>Not the sum, but the destination of the prize money after that was what he was interested in knowing.</p>
    <p>“I understand. You can feel sure that if we win, I will divide it equally among the other students in the group.”
    </p>
    <p>“Hearing that is a relief. I would prefer it if you could award us with varying sums according to our
        achievements rather than giving us all the same.”</p>
    <p>Though it wasn't required, he made it plain that he expected to be compensated extra for taking the lead.</p>
    <p>“I'll head out for a little while, then. In my spare time, I ought to be able to have one or two conversations.”
    </p>
    <p>Quickly leaving the shared room, Hashimoto moved as though savouring every moment.</p>
