    <h2>Partially Hidden Student-Teacher Meeting</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Only a few months have passed since the special test of survival and elimination. </p>
    <p>Although Kamuro’s expulsion was a surprise for the Year-2 students, partly because of how close she was with
        Sakayanagi, Kamuro was never a student who had friendly relationships with any students in the other classes, so
        the event’s effect did not last very long. </p>
    <p>But, that isn’t the only factor. </p>
    <p>Experience was certainly a big part of it too. </p>
    <p>Students are becoming more and more insensitive to the pain of losing their friends. </p>
    <p>As we entered the month of February, the details and the date for the student-teacher meeting were quickly
        announced. </p>
    <p>It would last 15 minutes per person while taking place over 5 days. </p>
    <p>To make time for the interviews, the afternoon classes would be made into self-study hours and after-school hours
        would also be used, under a format where the students would be called into a separate room when it is their
        turn. </p>
    <p>I can see the sun set as I look out through the classroom windows. </p>
    <p>This is the 5th day, and the day of my student-teacher meeting, which was assigned to this last timeslot. </p>
    <p>I received instructions on my phone from my teacher to come to the consultation office, so I decided to head
        there immediately. </p>
    <p>There are barely any students left in school, and the only ones I happened to pass by were the students on their
        way home from their club activities. </p>
    <p>I arrived in front of the consultation room, lightly clasped my hands and used the first knuckle joint on my
        fingers to tap three times on the door to signal my arrival. </p>
    <p>Naturally, Chabashira-sensei called out from inside the room to give me permission to enter. </p>
    <p>“Excuse me.” </p>
    <p>After speaking briefly, I opened the door and found Chabashira-sensei sliding her fingers over a tablet. </p>
    <p>“You’re here. Sit down.” </p>
    <p>She briefly glanced over at me, then looked back down to her tablet. </p>
    <p>“You seem busy.” </p>
    <p>“Whether I like it or not, things always get hectic around this time for homeroom teachers. Still, I do feel
        slightly relieved right now, considering that the student-teacher meetings will be over after today. I suppose I
        did the right thing by putting the two weirdos last.” </p>
    <p>After that, I sat down on a chair by the other side of the table. </p>
    <p>“Two weirdos… is that so?” </p>
    <p>“Is it really a shock to you that I would put you and Kouenji together?” </p>
    <p>“I’d be lying if I said I don’t think anything of it.” </p>
    <p>After my reply, Chabashira-sensei laughed just a little bit, and finally put her tablet on the table. </p>
    <p>“So you think Kouenji is more of a weirdo than you are? Well, I understand why you’d like to think that way, but
        there’s not much of a difference from my point of view. You’re plenty of a weirdo yourself.” </p>
    <p>I guess that’s just how the teachers see it. </p>
    <p>I’d certainly like to argue against that, but I decided to let it go for now. </p>
    <p>“Now. I don’t get many opportunities to speak with students one-on-one. I’m going to ask you about your school
        life before we get to your future. I want you to tell me if you think that there’s anything that can be improved
        from the school’s side.” </p>
    <p>“Nothing in particular. Personally, I’m satisfied with things as they are.” </p>
    <p>“I see. Maybe there’s something you’d like my advice on, like friendships and such?” </p>
    <p>“There is not.” </p>
    <p>After I immediately replied without hesitation, Chabashira-sensei showed me just a faint bitter smile on her
        face. </p>
    <p>“Most students have a thing or two to say, or they at least pretend to think about it. Well… I don’t think you’re
        holding back, but still.” </p>
    <p>She seems a little confused after I replied much faster than she expected, which I certainly understand. </p>
    <p>“I really don’t have any complaints.” </p>
    <p>If I did have any requests, I probably would have told her without holding anything back. </p>
    <p>“Well, that’s fine by me, but… Are you really sure there’s nothing at all?” </p>
    <p>Perhaps she’s worried as my homeroom teacher, as she asked again for the third time. </p>
    <p>“There’s nothing. I’m satisfied with my student life, and I’m not in any particular trouble.” </p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 11/Images/image2.webp" alt="">
    <p>“I see… That’s good, then.” </p>
    <p>She’s not hiding her worry that well, but it seems she decided to trust the word of her student for now. </p>
    <p>She started tapping on her tablet. </p>
    <p>“You’ve changed a lot too, Chabashira-sensei.” </p>
    <p>She probably understood this herself, as she forced herself to smile after sighing. </p>
    <p>“I never intended on it, but perhaps we could say I’ve become more frank and honest compared to before.” </p>
    <p>The Unanimous Special Test, which she also experienced as a student herself. </p>
    <p>And, the Unanimous Special Test, which she now experienced as a teacher. </p>
    <p>There are things she both gained and lost through these two experiences. </p>
    <p>I feel nostalgic when I think back to when I first started at this school, and how I couldn’t even imagine this
        teacher in front of me laughing. </p>
    <p>“...Ahem. Anyways. Don’t hesitate to tell me if you have any concerns about your school life in the future.” </p>
    <p>“I understand.” </p>
    <p>After my clear reply, the opening conversation quickly came to an end and we got down to the main topic of our
        student-teacher meeting. </p>
    <p>“If you’ve decided on whether you’ll be pursuing higher education or a career, I’d like you to tell me.” </p>
    <p>That crossroads is a big turning point for any high school student. </p>
    <p>That’s why the teachers have to make sure that the students don’t make the wrong decision. </p>
    <p>Still, I don’t think I can live up to what Chabashira-sensei is expecting from me here. </p>
    <p>“I believe my relative will decide on my future course. I don’t think there is anything for us to talk about here
        in regards to that.” </p>
    <p>“Your relative? In other words, are you telling me you’re going to obey your father’s decision?” </p>
    <p>The fact that I don’t have a mother is recorded in the school’s data. </p>
    <p>“Yes.” </p>
    <p>“I see. Well, this is rare, but some students do choose to prioritize their parent’s intentions. But most of them
        do tell us beforehand whether they will be pursuing a higher education or joining the workforce. Even in this
        school, we’re open to contact from parents, and in many cases we actually tell the student what their parents
        think. But, as of now, I’ve never received any requests for consultation from your family about your future.”
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, even if one is to obey their parents, it’s still strange for the direction they will head in to be
        undecided. </p>
    <p>However, seeing as there is no future higher education nor job-finding waiting for me, it’s pointless to notify
        Chabashira-sensei of such things. </p>
    <p>Of course, there is no way for her to completely grasp the circumstances surrounding this. </p>
    <p>“I don’t think it’s a problem.” </p>
    <p>“Maybe so, but… If by some chance you do want to pursue higher education, it’s about time you need to start
        working towards that. You need to make efforts towards passing the test on a level that your desired university
        requires, and—” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei started speaking, almost as if she was shocked by what I said, but suddenly stopped. </p>
    <p>She then corrected her posture, and looked at me in the eyes. </p>
    <p>“I’m not saying I know every detail about your past, and I do feel bad for pretending that I did just to take
        advantage of you in the past. But, right now, as your homeroom teacher, I want to fully understand the level of
        competency of the students under my charge. It’s my job to do so.” </p>
    <p>“I understand. I have no intentions of getting in the way of that.” </p>
    <p>I can’t see the tablet’s screen very clearly because of the light reflecting on it, but I suppose it’s
        Chabashira-sensei who will be scolded if she leaves empty entries for a student before offering it to the
        school. </p>
    <p>This part may also depend on the school, but a teacher’s performance and evaluation might be linked to whether or
        not their student goes on to a high level university or into a successful career path. </p>
    <p>“Tell me, then. If by some chance, your father decides you will go onto university, do you have the skills to
        successfully do so?” </p>
    <p>Whatever I reply here, my future is not going to change. </p>
    <p>But it would be cruel to pointlessly lower her evaluation because of my own abnormal circumstances. </p>
    <p>It’s probably best that I give her a fruitful answer here. </p>
    <p>“I believe I can make it into any university.” </p>
    <p>“...I see. Normally, I’d warn you that only an idiot would talk like that, but seeing as you’re the one saying
        it, it’s probably true. I know that much about you, at least.” </p>
    <p>Not arguing against what I said, Chabashira-sensei continued after accepting it as it is. </p>
    <p>“You seem to have received a gifted education. If you’re smart enough to say that without hesitation, I would
        expect you to contribute more to the class on a regular basis, but… Let’s overlook that part for now.” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei looked up after typing the contents of our conversation into her tablet. </p>
    <p>“I understand your situation. But, Ayanokouji, what about your own opinion? Do you have a vision for your future,
        knowing that you have to take the wishes of your parents into account?” </p>
    <p>“Not really. Even if I did, I wouldn’t have the right to make any decisions.” </p>
    <p>Arguing about that would be a pointless waste of time. </p>
    <p>“Sorry. Maybe that was a narrow-minded question.” </p>
    <p>“I don’t mind. In truth, I simply don’t have any dreams or hopes right now. I will seek your counsel if I ever
        find anything I would like to strive towards.” </p>
    <p>“I understand. So you’re going to obey your parents at this stage. In that case, the parent-teacher meeting will
        be held after the end of the 3rd semester, during the summer vacation. I assume you will have made a concrete
        decision on your future by then?” </p>
    <p>“That’s right.” </p>
    <p>Still, I doubt that he will participate in the meeting. </p>
    <p>The only thing I expect is to see some errand boy of that man coming to have a pointless chat. </p>
    <p>He would never talk about my relation to the White Room. </p>
    <p>“Your parent-teacher meeting is planned for April the 1st. You’ll be seeing your father after a very long time. I
        want you to think of it as a good opportunity to talk about your future without hesitation.” </p>
    <p>She’s talking like she’s certain that my parent will be there. </p>
    <p>No, maybe she really is sure of it? </p>
    <p>“...Can I say one thing?” </p>
    <p>That’s unthinkable, but it’s still worth a check. </p>
    <p>“Hm?” </p>
    <p>“Is my father coming? Not somebody else in his place?” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei looked a little confused as to the intent behind my question, and nodded. </p>
    <p>“Yeah. That’s what I’ve been told.” </p>
    <p>“Wait… Did he really accept the parent-teacher meeting?” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei still looked a little confused, but seemed to come to a slight understanding. </p>
    <p>“Indeed, when I first mailed him about the teacher-parent meeting, he replied that he would send a representative
        in his stead as he was very busy. So, your remark makes some sense. But, the other day, when I gave him the
        concrete date for the parent-teacher meeting, the circumstances seemed to have changed.” </p>
    <p>She checked her tablet again just to make sure, and continued. </p>
    <p>“Your father directly called me by phone and told me that he would pay a visit himself. I heard it from the man
        himself, so there’s no mistaking it.” </p>
    <p>“...But…” </p>
    <p>What kind of a turn of events could have caused this? </p>
    <p>That man isn’t someone who takes back his words so easily. </p>
    <p>At least, that was the case against us White Room students. </p>
    <p>He firmly told me that we would not see each other in this school, so why is he going out of his way to
        participate in the teacher-parent meeting? </p>
    <p>The fact that he refused at the start is consistent with my expectations. </p>
    <p>But why did he go out of his way to change his mind? </p>
    <p>It’s impossible not to think there’s something behind it. </p>
    <p>“About the phone call, what exactly did he tell you?” </p>
    <p>“What do you mean? It wasn’t a very deep conversation. He told me that he had arranged for a representative, but
        that he would actually come here himself since he managed to find some time. He also asked me to let him know in
        case there is even a slight change in the schedule. That doesn’t sound strange for such a busy man like your
        father, does it?” </p>
    <p>“Yeah.” </p>
    <p>Under normal circumstances, one would think that while he would not normally have enough time to pay a visit
        here, he found that he could actually participate after learning the concrete date of the meeting. </p>
    <p>It’s a simple flow of events to understand, and there’s nothing strange about it. </p>
    <p>“But… Ah, I suppose this isn’t something worth telling you.” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei was about to say something before she stopped. </p>
    <p>“But… what is it?” </p>
    <p>Wanting even just the slightest hint, I asked her to continue. </p>
    <p>“It’s not that big of a deal. I just thought it was a bit odd, is all. I understand him wanting to be notified if
        there is a change of schedule, when it’s about his own child. But your father requested to be notified if there
        are any changes in the schedule for any class I teach.” </p>
    <p>“For example, even if there is a change in schedule for a different student on another day?” </p>
    <p>“That’s right. I found it a little strange, but there’s no problem with just notifying him.” </p>
    <p>So that’s why Chabashira-sensei found my question odd. </p>
    <p>But, if that man is participating in the parent-teacher meeting, he could have a lot of intentions in his mind
        for it. </p>
    <p>“If it’s alright, may I see the teacher-parent meeting schedule?” </p>
    <p>“The schedule? …Yeah, it should be okay to show you.” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei used her tablet and turned the screen towards me. </p>
    <p>“This is the teacher-parent meeting schedule list of the entire class. The structure is mostly the same as the
        teacher-student meetings. In other words, you’re on the last day.” </p>
    <p>March 26, 28, 30, April 1. </p>
    <p>They’re held over 4 days in total. </p>
    <p>As Chabashira-sensei said, my name was listed for the afternoon on the last day, at 5 pm. </p>
    <p>“There’s nothing special to see on the list. Everything okay with you?” </p>
    <p>“Yes, thank you.” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei turned her tablet’s screen back towards herself. </p>
    <p>“I’m not going to tell you that you should stop being nervous about your parent-child relationship. I don’t know
        all the tiny details, but I know every father cares for his child. I think he just couldn’t ignore you.” </p>
    <p>“Maybe you’re right.” </p>
    <p>There’s no point in arguing about the way that man’s mind works with Chabashira-sensei here, so I just gave a
        reply. </p>
    <p>But in truth, it’s unthinkable that he would show up at the teacher-parent meeting because of such a reason. </p>
    <p>Did he decide to try and expel me himself, instead of relying on others? </p>
    <p>Even if that is the case, we already know that it’s no use for him to involve himself directly. </p>
    <p>For what purpose he decided to participate in the teacher-parent meeting, as of now, I still don’t know. </p>
    <p></p>
