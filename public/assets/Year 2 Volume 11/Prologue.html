    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <p>
        Before I even realized it, I found myself all alone.

    </p>
    <p>It’s not as if I am a particularly hated person.

    </p>
    <p>I just never drew anyone’s attention.

    </p>
    <p>I was always overshadowed and had no presence.

    </p>
    <p>Leaving how nobody likes me aside, I couldn’t even manage to get anyone to dislike me. So I was always all by
        myself.

    </p>
    <p>That’s how it was in kindergarten, primary school, and middle school too.

    </p>
    <p>I never had any real friends and mostly spent my time alone.

    </p>
    <p>I couldn’t develop the skills needed to talk to people, and just stayed invisible.

    </p>
    <p>I thought that was okay, though. I kept trying to convince myself that this was the good thing about me… </p>
    <p>

        I thought that it would be okay to keep living a lonely, quiet life after growing up too.

    </p>
    <p>And yet… I certainly am here.

    </p>
    <p>“...Yeah… I think losing doesn’t suit Sakayanagi-san…”

    </p>
    <p>“Why don't you try telling her? Noone has any right to blame you for your actions.”

    </p>
    <p>What is this feeling, this emotion seeping into my heart?

    </p>
    <p>I don’t know.

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t know.

    </p>
    <p>I simply had no idea… </p>
    <p>
        Until this day.
    </p>
