    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>After lunch, I got up while checking a message on my phone. </p>
    <p>It was just before 1 PM, with about an hour left until the day's first game. </p>
    <p>“Sorry, but I need to step out for a bit. Can we meet in the shared room?” </p>
    <p>“Sure, no problem. I'll take the first-years for some hands-on learning.” </p>
    <p>I thanked Hashimoto for handling the first-years and headed to the break room labeled ‘Rest Area.’ When I
        arrived, I saw the person who had called me sitting alone on a two-seater sofa, looking bored out the window.
    </p>
    <p>Another person stood nearby, also looking out. </p>
    <p>Their presence together seemed deliberate. </p>
    <p>"Do you need something, Nagumo-senpai?" </p>
    <p>"Need? Not exactly, but I do have something to discuss." </p>
    <p>he said, motioning me over with his fingers. </p>
    <p>I sat on the empty sofa in front of him. </p>
    <p>Asahina, the person by the window, turned around. </p>
    <p>“Hey, Ayanokoji-kun.” </p>
    <p>She greeted, then moved to sit next to Nagumo, pushing him to the side. </p>
    <p>“I expected a special exam, but it’s just a meeting. I’m disappointed.” </p>
    <p>Nagumo began, expressing his frustration with the training camp. </p>
    <p>"I really have bad luck." </p>
    <p>He sighed with a small smile. </p>
    <p>"Don’t you agree?" </p>
    <p>"Yes, compared to last year's mixed training camp, this is a downgrade. That’s why it's called an exchange
        meeting instead of a special exam." </p>
    <p>Last year’s camp had risks of expulsion, but this one had no penalties. </p>
    <p>I understood Nagumo’s disappointment. </p>
    <p>"But you knew this would happen, didn’t you, Asahina?" </p>
    <p>He asked, considering the timing of the camp. </p>
    <p>"...Yeah, I did." </p>
    <p>It was February, so a challenging exam involving all grades seemed unlikely. </p>
    <p>"It would’ve been nearly impossible for all third-year students to join, like last year." </p>
    <p>"Many third-years are busy with exams and job hunting. Only those with their futures decided and free time can
        attend. No matter how many private points they might get, most prefer to save their time." </p>
    <p>The third-years had a system to save and manage private points, and if they collected 20 million, someone could
        move to Class A. </p>
    <p>This time, the reward was non-transferable, only usable in Keyaki Mall, and not significant. </p>
    <p>Private university entrance exams typically started in late January, and national or public university exams in
        late February. </p>
    <p>Given it was early February, many students were preparing for their main exams. </p>
    <p>Spending three nights and four days taking care of their juniors was a big sacrifice. </p>
    <p>"Last year, the joint training camp was held a month earlier. Wasn't it still tough for the third-year students?"
    </p>
    <p>"I think so. Many third-years brought textbooks. Maybe that’s why this year’s camp is more relaxed." </p>
    <p>Considering this, Horikita Manabu's generation likely struggled behind the scenes. </p>
    <p>The school might have offered some relief, but we couldn’t know for sure. </p>
    <p>Despite being a busy time, this relaxed trip likely only included third-year students with clear goals for
        further studies or employment. </p>
    <p>"Can we assume the third-year students attending the exchange meeting volunteered?" </p>
    <p>Asahina nodded. </p>
    <p>"They recruited five volunteers from each class. If they didn't reach 20, they planned to reduce the number of
        groups." </p>
    <p>The school seemed considerate of the third-year students. </p>
    <p>"I haven't asked yet, but what are your and Nagumo-senpai’s plans after graduation?" </p>
    <p>Nagumo looked up, surprised by the question. </p>
    <p>"Do you want to know?" </p>
    <p>He seemed pleased by my interest. </p>
    <p>I nodded honestly to avoid upsetting him. </p>
    <p>"I'm going to university. I have no intention of using the Class A privilege." </p>
    <p>Nagumo said, confident in his ability to pass on his own merit. </p>
    <p>"I'm also going to university, like Miyabi, but a different one. My recent self-assessment on the common test was
        just under the cut-off point. If I graduate from Class A, I might be able to get in with the school's help, but
        I probably won't." </p>
    <p>Though they didn’t mention the university’s name, it seemed Nagumo was heading to a prestigious one. </p>
    <p>Asahina's decision not to aim too high was sensible, as forcing your way into a higher-level university with
        ANHS’s authority had risks. </p>
    <p>The Class A privilege was best used for job purposes, as Keisei had mentioned before. </p>
    <p>"I don't see any value in the Class A privilege itself. Do you know why?" </p>
    <p>"Because you have the power to achieve your goals on your own." </p>
    <p>"Exactly. That’s why I dominated the third year and became an overwhelming presence. Whether I'm in Class B or
        Class D at graduation, I believe I can get into the university I want and secure a job on my own." </p>
    <p>Asahina looked at Nagumo with a deliberately disgusted expression, but it was likely true. </p>
    <p>"Even if everyone united to drop you to Class B, it wouldn’t raise motivation or be easy to maintain. That’s why
        we have the current results." </p>
    <p>Nagumo nodded in agreement. </p>
    <p>Of course, it was better to have the Class A privilege. </p>
    <p>The difference was whether you relied on it or considered it just insurance. </p>
    <p>“By the way, Horikita-senpai is also going to the university Miyabi is attending. That shows how much he admires
        him.” </p>
    <p>“Leave me alone. If you want, you can take the exam next year and join us. I’ll welcome you.” </p>
    <p>“If I go, I'll have to work really hard on the common test, right?” </p>
    <p>“I'll refrain. I think it would be quite difficult even with my academic ability.” </p>
    <p>Unlike Asahina, Nagumo seemed unimpressed by my modest response. </p>
    <p>He laughed and shrugged his shoulders. </p>
    <p>“Let's cut to the chase. This exchange meeting mainly offers private points with no real losses, so fewer people
        take it seriously. While it lacks excitement, I decided it's better than nothing.” </p>
    <p>A game is a game, and this match will be our final chance. </p>
    <p>“You want to compete with me during this exchange meeting, right?” </p>
    <p>“That's right.” </p>
    <p>For the third-years, this meeting had minimal returns. </p>
    <p>Nagumo made it a point to challenge me. </p>
    <p>Hearing this, Asahina leaned closer to Nagumo. </p>
    <p>"Is that what this is about? It's unfair to target Ayanokoji-kun like this." </p>
    <p>"So you joined to protect Ayanokoji? How kind of you.". </p>
    <p>"But Ayanokoji-kun hasn’t done anything wrong. Why are you so persistent?" </p>
    <p>Asahina questioned, pushing against Nagumo. </p>
    <p>This seemed to slightly irritate Nagumo, who responded with a half-smile. </p>
    <p>"Do you know why Horikita Suzune joined the student council, Nazuna?" </p>
    <p>"To follow in her brother's footsteps?" </p>
    <p>"No, that wasn't it. At first, she joined to keep an eye on me through Ayanokoji." </p>
    <p>"Really?" </p>
    <p>"I suppose he judged me a bad student council president, but that wasn’t the case, was it?" </p>
    <p>While Nagumo's actions were sometimes excessive, he didn’t cause major issues that warranted caution from
        Horikita Manabu. </p>
    <p>"True. I think your actions brought positive changes to the school." </p>
    <p>"Maybe you were too influenced by Horikita-senpai." </p>
    <p>Before entering school, I had little social interaction, so Horikita Manabu greatly influenced me. </p>
    <p>The school preferred stability, while Nagumo aimed for reform. </p>
    <p>Their ideologies were always bound to clash. </p>
    <p>"Horikita-senpai did pass the baton to me." </p>
    <p>"So you admit it." </p>
    <p>"Too late to deny it now." </p>
    <p>"Wait, what? This isn’t what I expected." </p>
    <p>Asahina said, looking flustered. </p>
    <p>"Despite his calm appearance, he pulls strings behind the scenes." </p>
    <p>Nagumo said, then asked, "I assume you're willing to accept a match with me?" </p>
    <p>"Why add conditions beyond the exchange meeting’s rules and rewards?" </p>
    <p>"I thought about leaving it be, but trapping you for personal reasons within the school’s matches would cause
        problems." </p>
    <p>If we, not even in the same year, imposed risky bets, the school wouldn’t be pleased. </p>
    <p>"Actually, calling it a match is an exaggeration. It's more like a small bet." </p>
    <p>"A bet?" </p>
    <p>"Yes. If you win, I'll give you a decent reward." </p>
    <p>"So, even if I lose, I don’t have to give up my private points?" </p>
    <p>"Sounds easy, right?" </p>
    <p>It felt more like a game than a serious bet, but it seemed suspicious that only Nagumo was at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>"I see no reason to refuse, but with the current rules, there's not much either of us can do. You're the leader,
        so you can't participate directly, can you?" </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin was leading the third-year students, and first and second-year students were the ones playing. </p>
    <p>The stage was different for each of us. </p>
    <p>"Or are you suggesting a match outside the exchange meeting?" </p>
    <p>This facility had the tools and spaces for that. </p>
    <p>"It wouldn't be bad, but if we do that, there’s no need to stick to this camp." </p>
    <p>"True. At school, we could have a more legitimate match." </p>
    <p>"If the school says to hold an exchange meeting, I'll follow the rules." </p>
    <p>Nagumo continued, "At first, I thought about letting you lead and directing the first and second-year students."
    </p>
    <p>On the surface, third-year Kiryuuin was the leader, but I would actually give the instructions. </p>
    <p>It seemed he anticipated her not participating in the game. </p>
    <p>"Not bad, right?" </p>
    <p>"Yes, but it wouldn’t be fair unless he chose his group members." </p>
    <p>Nagumo had chosen all his group members himself. If Kiryuuin were to entrust the group members she picked, it
        wouldn’t be a fair start. </p>
    <p>"And when you open the lid, it's a round-robin. If there's only one direct confrontation after three days, it
        lacks excitement. That’s why I thought I'd stop insisting on the same conditions." </p>
    <p>Nagumo pointed at me. </p>
    <p>"You participate in all the games. If you lose three times, that’s your defeat." </p>
    <p>"I don’t have to worry about the group's win or loss?" </p>
    <p>"Yes. Even if Kiryuuin’s group loses 19 times, if you don't lose, it's a win." </p>
    <p>So, the condition was to win 17 of the 19 games individually. </p>
    <p>"You’re kind to let me lose twice." </p>
    <p>"If I made being undefeated a condition and you lost the first battle, it would be a real turn-off. It’s more fun
        to keep you around longer." </p>
    <p>Nagumo set the three-loss limit for his own enjoyment. </p>
    <p>"Isn't that too unfair for Ayanokoji-kun? Card games are all about luck." </p>
    <p>"He has nothing to lose even if he doesn’t win. The right to set the rules is ours." </p>
    <p>"Well, that's true." </p>
    <p>Though slightly dissatisfied, I realized there was no reason to refuse since the risk on my side was zero. </p>
    <p>"All I want is your defeat. It's only natural for me to demand a high probability of victory. I'm also offering
        private points as compensation." </p>
    <p>"Is it okay to mess with a kouhai just before graduation?" </p>
    <p>"That's how I like to treat you." </p>
    <p>It wouldn't hurt to respond to Nagumo's wishes in some way, as he'd be graduating in March anyway. </p>
    <p>"Understood. I'll accept your proposal." </p>
    <p>Nagumo nodded slightly. </p>
    <p>"Of course, I've already told Kiryūin that you'll participate in all the games." </p>
    <p>It seemed negotiations had been conducted assuming my acceptance. </p>
    <p>"As an outsider, you can refuse if you don't like it. Even if you don't pay anything when you lose, the fact that
        you lost will remain." </p>
    <p>That was exactly what Nagumo wanted—the matter of 'winning' and 'losing.' </p>
    <p>"If Ayanokoji says he'll accept, you don't need to say anything unnecessary," </p>
    <p>Nagumo interrupted. Asahina, feeling treated rudely, puffed out her cheeks but backed down when she saw I was
        fine with it. </p>
    <p>"But you really didn't hold back in your selection, Senpai. The students in the other groups were a bit taken
        aback." </p>
    <p>Nagumo smiled, showing no discontent. </p>
    <p>"Even in a trivial exchange meeting, a game is a game. As a former student council president, I have to show my
        dignity." </p>
    <p>He intended to win in the exchange meeting where he participated as a leader, apart from the battle with me. </p>
    <p>That was Nagumo's freedom; it was none of my business. </p>
    <p>"Even if you start winning several in a row, it's easier to stop you if I can command the group directly." </p>
    <p>"Wow. You're ruthless, Miyabi." </p>
    <p>"No, I don’t think so. Nagumo-senpai's thinking is correct." </p>
    <p>It was a matter of skill to drag your opponent into your own ring after creating a favourable situation. </p>
    <p>Given the structure of only facing each group once and the atmosphere of the exchange meeting, it was safe to say
        it wouldn't be clear how many times a particular individual had participated in a game. </p>
    <p>But that was also in my favour. </p>
    <p>It would be too conspicuous to take on a group as a second-year student, but individual battles were possible
        without drawing attention. </p>
    <p>While setting the stage for himself, he had also considered my situation. </p>
    <p>"Nazuna seems to misunderstand, but victory or defeat isn’t just about being excellent. If the person on top
        isn’t more capable, using a skilled person will only lead to their loss." </p>
    <p>Nagumo's words were true. </p>
    <p>No matter how many pieces you were given in shogi, if your skill was insufficient, you couldn't win. </p>
    <p>"Sorry I'm late. Has the discussion been settled?" </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin appeared in the break room. </p>
    <p>"Everything's going smoothly. It's going to be a match between me and Ayanokoji as planned." </p>
    <p>Nagumo said, turning to me. </p>
    <p>"Kiryuuin must have sensed I was planning to challenge you and volunteered for this role." </p>
    <p>"That's right." </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin nodded. </p>
    <p>"If you want, I can give you the authority as the leader. On the surface, I'll make it look like I chose the
        participants. That way, we can compete as a group." </p>
    <p>She proposed a win-win situation, perhaps wanting to watch my victory or defeat from the nearest seat without
        doing anything. </p>
    <p>"I see. That explains why those three from Class A ended up in the same group." </p>
    <p>When Hashimoto and Morishita stopped by the convenience store, they ran into Yamamura, and Kiryuuin happened to
        be there at the same time. </p>
    <p>That might have influenced the group choice. </p>
    <p>If she handed over the authority to me, it was to save time and deepen friendships. </p>
    <p>"I don't know much about your current friendships. It was a chance encounter, and I let you choose randomly. If
        you're uncomfortable in the group, it would be hard to show your true abilities." </p>
    <p>Thanks to Hashimoto and Hiyori, the conversation flowed smoothly. </p>
    <p>"I appreciate your consideration, but I'll decline your offer. Unfortunately, I'm not good at socializing and I'm
        too busy trying to get along with my kouhais." </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin seemed disappointed but not too bothered. </p>
    <p>"I didn't expect Kiryuuin-senpai to get involved in this matter." </p>
    <p>Nagumo and Kiryuuin weren't exactly friends; they stood in opposing positions. Kiryuuin smiled happily at my
        response. </p>
    <p>"Anyway, I'm glad the match is happening, Nagumo. It's a pity that third-year students can't participate directly
        in the game." </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin remarked, perhaps genuinely or not. </p>
    <p>"If there was a rule allowing participation, would you have given it your all?" </p>
    <p>"It's a rare chance involving Ayanokoji. Of course, I want to meet his expectations." </p>
    <p>"You're really sold on Ayanokoji. If you want, I can challenge you individually, not just in this exchange
        meeting. Since we're both third-years, there's no need to hold back. I'll even bet the Class A ticket price."
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, but I'll decline. That ticket is soaked with the blood and sweat of the entire year. It's too heavy for
        me, who hasn't been involved, to accept." </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin responded, confident in her ability to win. </p>
    <p>"That's a shame." </p>
    <p>Nagumo said, seemingly unfazed after three years of knowing her. </p>
    <p>"Well then, I have some leader duties to attend to. Let's meet again later." </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin said before leaving. </p>
    <p>"Fuka-chan is always cool." </p>
    <p>Asahina commented. </p>
    <p>"She's just a woman, after all." </p>
    <p>"That's a terrible thing to say, Miyabi. In this day and age, you can't complain even if you're killed for that."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't get me wrong. I just want to be on top among the same sex; there's no discrimination or anything." </p>
    <p>"Even so, your way of speaking can cause misunderstandings." </p>
    <p>Nagumo wouldn't be in trouble if he spoke a bit more tactfully. </p>
    <p>When I got up from the sofa, Nagumo and Asahina followed suit. </p>
    <p>We all left the break room together. </p>
    <p>"You should also practice or something and prepare for the match." </p>
    <p>"I will." </p>
    <p>"Ah, finally you're out. You're done talking, right?" </p>
    <p>Amasawa appeared from down the hallway, looking as if she had been waiting impatiently. </p>
    <p>Nagumo scratched the back of his head at her appearance and words. </p>
    <p>"Didn't you hear my instructions? I told you to wait, didn't I?" </p>
    <p>"It's okay. I’ll work twice as hard during exams." </p>
    <p>"I can't trust your words yet. If you do something on your own again, you better think you won’t be given another
        chance." </p>
    <p>"That's harsh. I understand, I'll follow the instructions properly." </p>
    <p>"Nagumo, this girl is... um..." </p>
    <p>I trailed off. </p>
    <p>"Amasawa. From first-year Class A." </p><img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 11/Images/image1.webp" alt="">
    <p>"Oh, right. You're Amasawa-chan. You must be pretty good to be called into Miyabi's group, huh?" </p>
    <p>"Well, not that much..." </p>
    <p>Amasawa replied modestly. </p>
    <p>Considering she had achieved the rare A in both academic and physical abilities on the OAA, it wasn't surprising.
    </p>
    <p>However, for overall ability and quick thinking, Amasawa wasn't necessarily the top candidate. </p>
    <p>"She wasn't my pick. Somehow, she heard rumours and knew about the next social gathering." </p>
    <p>"That's why I put myself forward. I promised to help secure first place." </p>
    <p>"Honestly, I had some reservations about recruiting her." </p>
    <p>Whether it was due to her personality or suspicions about her relationship with me, he didn't specify. </p>
    <p>He probably decided to recruit her because it seemed like a minor issue. </p>
    <p>"You need to organize your own group too, Nazuna. As a Class A student, aim for the win. Can you always rely on
        us?" </p>
    <p>"Eh, oh my gosh, it's already this late!? I have to go, but feel free to consult me if you have any problems!"
    </p>
    <p>Asahina exclaimed, glancing at her phone before hurriedly running off. </p>
    <p>She nearly tripped on her way, but quickly disappeared around the corner. </p>
    <p>"I wonder if Nazuna can lead a group with that attitude." </p>
    <p>Amasawa smirked, leaning towards Nagumo, who sighed in disbelief. </p>
    <p>"Are you dating Asahina-senpai?" </p>
    <p>"Huh? No, I'm not," </p>
    <p>"But you told me to wait because you had important things to discuss with Ayanokoji-senpai, and yet you kept
        Asahina-senpai by your side. That's special, isn't it?" </p>
    <p>"It's none of your business." </p>
    <p>"Eh~ it is. If I'm aiming for Nagumo-senpai, she's my rival." </p>
    <p>"You’re aiming for a guy who's about to graduate?" </p>
    <p>"I'm a patient woman. I can handle a long-distance relationship." </p>
    <p>Amasawa replied with a smile. </p>
    <p>"Sorry, but I don't like women who pretend to be cute or flatter me." </p>
    <p>Nagumo said bluntly. </p>
    <p>Amasawa feigned hurt at his rejection, clearly exaggerating her reaction. </p>
    <p>Nagumo, probably irritated, deliberately looked away. </p>
    <p>"I'm leaving now. Do your best, Ayanokoji." </p>
    <p>Nagumo said before walking away, leaving Amasawa and me alone in the hallway. </p>
    <p>"Does he dislike me?" </p>
    <p>"If you say things to make yourself disliked, that’s what happens." </p>
    <p>"But look, you’re also disliked, Ayanokoji-senpai, so I wanted to be in the same group." </p>
    <p>She said with a smile. </p>
    <p>"What kind of group is that?" </p>
    <p>"I think it’s true they aren’t dating, but their relationship does seem special, doesn’t it?" </p>
    <p>"Well, yeah. It seems like they've gone beyond just being friends." </p>
    <p>"By the way, it seems you knew about the exchange meeting in advance." </p>
    <p>"We were told in advance what kind of exchange meeting would be held." </p>
    <p>‘We’ means, It included Yagami, who Tsukishiro managed. They were given the schedule for the year upon entering
        the school. If they were going to expel me, giving them information in advance made sense. </p>
    <p>"I don't understand why you chose to team up with Nagumo." </p>
    <p>"Isn’t it obvious? The chances of winning seem high. He was the student council president. Plus, I'm a girl of
        age; I want private points." </p>
    <p>she said, though it was clear she was lying. </p>
    <p>However, she quickly corrected herself, revealing her true intentions. </p>
    <p>"I thought you and Nagumo-senpai would be competing soon. I figured it might be nice to be on your side and
        support you, but that wouldn't be fun, would it?" </p>
    <p>"That's the reason?" </p>
    <p>"That's the reason indeed. I thought if I sided with Nagumo-senpai, we might have a good match..." </p>
    <p>Amasawa sighed, holding her cheek. </p>
    <p>"Nagumo-senpai's disappointment is evident. The school's list is just full of games. Winning a game of
        rock-paper-scissors or cards against him wouldn't be satisfying. I didn't need to antagonize him." </p>
    <p>"There's nothing we can do about that." </p>
    <p>"I heard from Nagumo-senpai first, but the rules are that if you lose three times, it’s your loss, right? I could
        feel his desire to see you lose in any way. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens." </p>
    <p>"I hope it’s something to look forward to, but there’s a good chance I could lose three times in a row without
        any surprises." </p>
    <p>"But Nagumo-senpai and I don’t think so." </p>
    <p>"Do you understand Nagumo's feelings too?" </p>
    <p>"I made fun of it, so I wasn’t allowed to come to the discussion." </p>
    <p>"Did you come here to greet me even though you were refused?" </p>
    <p>"Was it not good?" </p>
    <p>She asked innocently. </p>
    <p>It wasn’t that it wasn’t good, but there was no reason to force contact with Nagumo and risk his resentment. </p>
    <p>To stand out within the group, both ability and likability were important. </p>
    <p>"Well then, I've been called to my group, so I'll head back. See you later." </p>
    <p>Amasawa said with a quick turn, leaving cheerfully. </p>
    <p>Our casual conversation left me with one concern. </p>
    <p>Amasawa mentioned she had been informed about this exchange meeting by Tsukishiro and others in advance, which
        contradicted something said earlier. </p>
    <p>"I wonder what she's up to." </p>
    <p>I thought. It might be wise to do a little research. </p>
