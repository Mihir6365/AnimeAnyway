    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>After the puzzling teacher-student meeting, I returned to the dormitory before dark and got into the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>I have dinner plans with Kei today at 7 pm. </p>
    <p>So first of all, I have to get ready in one hour. I first decided to go back to my room to wash my hands… </p>
    <p>Then, I assembled a detailed plan in my head as I got off the elevator, and…</p>
    <p>“Yo. Looks like you’re back pretty late, Ayanokoji.” </p>
    <p>I saw an unexpected person waiting for me leaning on the door. </p>
    <p>It’s a student of the Sakayanagi Class, Hashimoto Masayoshi. </p>
    <p>“Seeing as you came up alone, I’m guessing you weren’t on a date.” </p>
    <p>He checked to see if the elevator was empty, then asked me about it. </p>
    <p>“I had my teacher-student meeting today, that’s why I’m late.” </p>
    <p>“Oh, really..? I hadn’t thought of that. I wanna talk, is this a good tie?” </p>
    <p>He cut to the reason for his visit after reflecting on his own lack of a grasp on the situation. </p>
    <p>“Looks like it’s not going to be a standing conversation.” </p>
    <p>“You’re right. That wouldn’t be so great for me.” </p>
    <p>I guess I have to play along. </p>
    <p>“You can come into my room if you want.” </p>
    <p>It’s going to cut into my time for cooking dinner, but I can accommodate him a little. </p>
    <p>I don’t see any other reason to refuse, so I decided to invite Hashimoto in. </p>
    <p>“Sorry.” </p>
    <p>“I’m going to listen, but don’t expect too much from me.” </p>
    <p>“That’s all I can ask for right now.” </p>
    <p>He smiled faintly, almost as if mocking himself, and lightly tapped me on the back as I inserted the key into the
        cylinder. </p>
    <p>I glanced over at the fire escape for a moment when I opened the door. </p>
    <p>I felt the presence of someone watching me, but it’s difficult to judge whether Hashimoto is aware of this or
        not. I decided to just go in for now. </p>
    <p>“Excuse me. …Oh, you can definitely tell the owner of this room has a girlfriend.” </p>
    <p>He whistled when he entered the room as he saw the signs left behind by Kei. </p>
    <p>“Can I sit on the bed? Is that going to be unpleasant for you?” </p>
    <p>“Unpleasant? You can sit wherever you want.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto quickly sat down after asking for permission. </p>
    <p>Does he have some reservations about sitting on someone else’s bed? </p>
    <p>“So? What do you want to talk about?” </p>
    <p>“It’s a rather heavy subject. I’m having a difficult time figuring out what to do with myself. I wanted some
        advice.” </p>
    <p>He quickly cut to the chase without talking around the subject, but something feels a little strange. </p>
    <p>Still, it would be rude to interrupt already, so I decided to let him go on. </p>
    <p>“What to do with yourself?” </p>
    <p>“You’ve heard already, haven’t you? That Kamurou-chan was expelled?” </p>
    <p>“I’ve heard some rumours. Someone teamed up with Ryuuen and leaked information during the special test. As a
        result, Class-A dropped down to last place.” </p>
    <p>“Indeed. That test was over for them the moment they let information get out.” </p>
    <p>As Hashimoto says, the decisive factor in their defeat was the betrayal and the information leak. </p>
    <p>It is highly likely that Class-A could have avoided last rank if there was no leak. </p>
    <p>“I’m one she was suspicious of at first. Even now, the other students are acting cold towards me.” </p>
    <p>In fact, I’m sure that it’s not just within his class. </p>
    <p>The act of betraying one’s class in such a way is both a shock and a threat to others. </p>
    <p>“I’ve heard about that, to be honest. I sympathize with your current situation.” </p>
    <p>So far, the loudest voices are saying Hashimoto was the traitor. </p>
    <p>They say that he had been in contact with Ryuuen, and that he had a secret agreement with him. </p>
    <p>This is only natural, as Hashimoto has acted suspiciously on several occasions in the past. </p>
    <p>However, I haven’t heard of any solid evidence yet. </p>
    <p>At present, it is simply being suggested that it might be Hashimoto by a process of elimination. </p>
    <p>“Am I supposed to just give up and accept this too? Tell myself that it’s my fault because of my previous
        actions?” </p>
    <p>“You can also take action and claim your innocence if you don’t want to cry yourself to sleep.” </p>
    <p>“Maybe. They say we are innocent until proven guilty, but I think it’s actually the other way around in this
        world. If you speak up when people are suspicious of you, you’ll only make things worse. The people decide who
        the culprit is in their minds, without any evidence, and they get even more suspicious if you complain.” </p>
    <p>That’s exactly what they call an echo chamber. </p>
    <p>A group of students with similar opinions mistakenly believing that they are in the right. </p>
    <p>This tendency is particularly heightened in an exclusive school like this. </p>
    <p>The trouble is that Hashimoto himself can’t do anything about this unless he can provide conclusive proof that he
        is not the culprit. </p>
    <p>“You might be right to choose silence.” </p>
    <p>“Right?” </p>
    <p>Opening his mouth won’t change anything unless he has the materials to prove he is innocent. </p>
    <p>In fact, bold statements will just create more doubt. </p>
    <p>“I’m going to cry.” </p>
    <p>He started rubbing his eyes before I started talking again. </p>
    <p>“Maybe that’s enough preamble? So why did you betray Sakayanagi?” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto suddenly froze up and slowly moved his fingers away from his eyes. </p>
    <p>“Come on, let me talk. Isn’t it fun watching me pretend to be a pitiable fool?” </p>
    <p>“I think it’s a waste of time. It’s already late, so I want to start preparing dinner as soon as possible.” </p>
    <p>I didn’t mention the fact that Kei would be coming to my room afterwards. </p>
    <p>“What, you got a date with your girlfriend or something?” </p>
    <p>“Something like that.” </p>
    <p>“Oh, I see. I thought our friendship was more important than girls?” </p>
    <p>“Sorry, I promised her before talking with you. Besides, I don’t remember us having a deep friendship.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto sighed with his hands on the bed after I told the truth as it was. </p>
    <p>“Well, I guess it’s a good thing you can calmly analyze the situation. That’s better for me right now anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>He paused for a moment, then returned to the heart of the matter. </p>
    <p>“Why do you think I betrayed Sakayanagi?” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto wanted me to think about my answer a little before replying. </p>
    <p>“I don’t know much. The only reason I can think of is that you received a hefty amount of private points.” </p>
    <p>This is also the narrative the other students have in mind. </p>
    <p>However, I am skeptical that this would be enough for a betrayal. </p>
    <p>It’s true that he did manage to sully Sakayanagi’s name, but only once. </p>
    <p>Besides, they lost 100 class points. </p>
    <p>The expulsion of Kamurou, a close associate, was also significant but it was only a by-product, unlikely to have
        been a part of the negotiation process or the reward. </p>
    <p>500,000 or 5,000,000. Even if it was more, it’s still too cheap a price to betray your class. </p>
    <p>“I’m not asking for the answer that anyone else can give me, I’m asking for your opinion.” </p>
    <p>It seems Hashimoto knows too well that I didn’t answer his question seriously. </p>
    <p>“Sorry, but I don’t feel like talking about my opinions right now.” </p>
    <p>“Huh? Why? Because you and I don’t have anything to do with each other?” </p>
    <p>“That’s not it. It’s because you’re not speaking seriously.” </p>
    <p>“Huh? I honestly want your advice. I’m desperately looking for a way to save myself.” </p>
    <p>“If that’s true, you’re too late anyway.” </p>
    <p>“Too late..?” </p>
    <p>“A man who can’t even decide what to do with himself wouldn’t be someone who would betray his class in the first
        place.” </p>
    <p>Aiming at Sakayanagi is as good as aiming at the head of the general. </p>
    <p>It’s not a decision that can be made on the spur of the moment, he must have considered everything that would
        follow suit as well. </p>
    <p>“I see. I guess it was stupid to say I needed advice on my future…” </p>
    <p>That’s what felt strange to me, right when our conversation started. </p>
    <p>Hashimoto repeatedly apologized for his behaviour, and returned to the main subject again. </p>
    <p>“The reason I betrayed Sakayanagi is your very existence, Ayanokouji. I was just trying to persuade Sakayanagi to
        do anything it takes in order to pull you into Class-A.” </p>
    <p>“Persuade? It didn’t look anything like persuasion to me. It was just an act of self-harm that included your
        class.” </p>
    <p>“That’s an interesting way to express it. Well, I guess it mostly fits.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto replied with a smile, but I’m not sure if it’s a sincere one. </p>
    <p>I sense that he’s trying to conceal his feelings. He probably doesn’t want me to see his weaknesses. </p>
    <p>He told me a story that contained the truth, but also mixed in a few lies within it. </p>
    <p>“My doubts are only increasing. Why would you betray Sakayanagi after weighing her against me in the first place?
        Don’t you think the other students would have a hard time understanding that?” </p>
    <p>“Anyone who has a problem with it is just incompetent. I don’t need any humility in this situation. I’ve been
        working harder than any one to gain information, and I’m convinced that you’re the best there is. I can explain
        it from the start if it is necessary, but I don’t want to waste your precious time.” </p>
    <p>“I don’t think you’ll be convinced even if I deny it.” </p>
    <p>“I won’t. You have the talent to turn around your class’s standing all by yourself. So I threatened Sakayanagi
        that I will betray her again if she doesn’t poach you. If she listens to me, you’ll be a firm rock in Class-A.
        It’s a flawless formula for victory.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto clenched his fist as he spoke, but he’s way too reckless and unrealistic. </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry to say this, but this is just an empty dream. Even if I am as capable as you imagine me to be, it’s
        pointless if I make an enemy out of Sakayanagi. And when I was invited before, I did say that I would consider
        it in a positive manner, but I don’t remember officially saying that I would come.” </p>
    <p>He’s going way too far ahead of himself, acting on his own initiative without even receiving a commitment. </p>
    <p>“So are you saying that if you use your transfer, you won’t be coming to Class-A?” </p>
    <p>“That’s all I can say at the moment. I definitely don’t want to oppose Sakayanagi, anyhow.” </p>
    <p>I naturally gave my thoughts, and while looking shocked, Hashimoto muttered, ‘Yeah, I knew it.’ “I would have
        preferred a yes as your answer, but, yeah. I guess it’s not gonna be so easy.” </p>
    <p>He was calm in his reply, which suggests he has fully considered the possibility that I would not choose Class-A.
    </p>
    <p>If so, then what was the purpose of his betrayal? </p>
    <p>It’s difficult to make a proper guess with the information I currently have. </p>
    <p>“Hey, do I look like a traitor to you? Sakayanagi blamed me right away, you know.” </p>
    <p>“I guess that’s your character.” </p>
    <p>“Come on, defend me a little here… just kidding. I know I started it, but I received a declaration of all-out war
        from her. There’s no way I can win, right?” </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi regrets abandoning Kamurou, and her feelings regarding the traitor who caused this to happen are
        probably quite intense. </p>
    <p>“But, y’know, am I the only one to blame for this betrayal? I just did the best I could to make sure I graduate
        in Class-A. She didn’t listen to me, so I had to force her hand. How am I the bad guy?” </p>
    <p>“So you’re arguing back. Well, your intuition is not wrong. Considering the present potential of each class,
        there is no proof that you can stay in Class-A by simply following Sakayanagi’s orders.” </p>
    <p>As a current problem, the difference between class points is getting closer and closer. </p>
    <p>“Yeah.” </p>
    <p>“But you’ve simultaneously committed a grave mistake.” </p>
    <p>“By making Sakayanagi my enemy?” </p>
    <p>“Right, but also wrong. Your mistake isn’t making Sakayanagi your enemy. The mistake was to act and make her your
        enemy when you had no guarantee of victory. You should have chosen a different method if you had little chance
        of winning.” </p>
    <p>“I thought about it in my own way. I reached the conclusion that this was the only way.” </p>
    <p>“You did the math and came up with an answer. That doesn’t mean your answer was correct.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto did not deny this, and imagined what would happen next. </p>
    <p>“I can’t take it back now. So, you think I’m just going to be destroyed by Sakayanagi?” </p>
    <p>“Probably. If you don’t want that, then your only option is to beat her.” </p>
    <p>“You think I can win if I fight against her?” </p>
    <p>“For you, does defeating Sakayanagi mean expelling her?” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto nodded. In other words, there is no peaceful path. If so, there is only one answer. </p>
    <p>“She’s too much for you, no matter how you look. I can’t say for certain since things also depend on the next
        special test, but I believe Sakayanagi now wants to expel you even more than Ryuuen. In an extreme case, even if
        you do manage to expel Sakayanagi, she may be prepared to stab you back and take you down with her.” </p>
    <p>This would be killing two birds with one stone for Ryuuen, since he would not have to bother with Hashimoto, a
        traitor, and he would also have buried a powerful enemy. </p>
    <p>No, it would be difficult to defeat Sakayanagi in the first place, even if she was prepared to drag him down with
        her. </p>
    <p>As far as I can currently see, there is an overwhelming difference of power between Sakayanagi and Hashimoto.
    </p>
    <p>She’s one, or even two leagues above him, and she has saved up protection points. </p>
    <p>In other words, he has to stab her twice to beat her. </p>
    <p>Besides, Hashimoto is currently only thinking about how to fight against Sakayanagi. </p>
    <p>But that’s a naive thought. </p>
    <p>I understand his desire to believe that the problem will be resolved when the match is settled. </p>
    <p>However, even if he manages to defeat Sakayanagi, that would only be the beginning. </p>
    <p>Rebuilding a collapsing class. </p>
    <p>Those coming after him for revenge. Problems will come flooding in one after another. </p>
    <p>He betrayed Sakayanagi, knowing that he would be at a disadvantage, and that there is no guarantee I would join
        them. </p>
    <p>“Your flaw, which I’ve noticed from this discussion, is that you don’t trust people.” </p>
    <p>He doesn’t tell others everything and acts out of his own judgement. </p>
    <p>That works when you succeed, but there’s no one for him to rely on when he fails. </p>
    <p>“I won’t deny that. But Ryuuen and Sakayanagi are the same way too. They never trust others.” </p>
    <p>“That’s because they’ve developed enough strength to fight on their own without relying on others.” </p>
    <p>“So that’s where it comes back to.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto does have the foresight to see ahead. </p>
    <p>He sensed first-hand that he would eventually lose if we were to become enemies. </p>
    <p>There’s nothing wrong with that so far. </p>
    <p>But he has been, and will continue to think and reach conclusions by himself. </p>
    <p>This is the harmful result of not being able to trust others. </p>
    <p>If Hashimoto had a few people whom he could completely trust, he might have been better off right now. </p>
    <p>“I don’t want you to think I turned against Sakayanagi without any chance of winning. I’m not that foolish.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto muttered, claiming that he has his own chance at victory. </p>
    <p>I continued listening to hear him out, but he doesn’t seem like he will continue talking. </p>
    <p>“...Before letting you hear the rest of it, there is one thing I want to check with you.” </p>
    <p>With that, Hashimoto asked me a certain question. </p>
    <p>Why did he decide to betray Sakayanagi and take a big gamble at that timing? </p>
    <p>His question was to bring up this topic. </p>
    <p></p>
