    <h3>Part 2</h3>
   <p>
The class quickly started talking about the student-teacher and parent-teacher meetings right after Chabashira-sensei left.

</p><p>“I guess we have to start thinking about our future.”

</p><p>“We have to think about what we’ll do both if we graduate in Class A and if we don’t, right? Hey, what’s your plan, Hirata?”

</p><p>The girls gathered around Yousuke sitting at the class’s center and started chatting. 

</p><p>“I’m thinking about going to university regardless of Class A privileges. I think that’s what my parents want for me too.”

</p><p>I’m not straining to listen, but I won’t resist hearing what I can hear. 

</p><p>Yousuke currently seems like he’s planning on going to university instead of trying to find a job. 

</p><p>It’s a natural development, considering his inclination towards studying and his current academic prowess. 

</p><p>Whether or not he will have Class A privileges, he can’t utilize them if he doesn’t possess the ability to do so.

</p><p>However, one could say this for anything.

</p><p>“Oh. I was sure you’d want to become a soccer athlete or something.” 

</p><p>“Haha, that’s a bit much for me. Even if I go pro by using Class A privileges, I’ll probably be released right away if I don’t actually have the talent. I’m going to continue playing soccer in university, but only as a hobby.” 

</p><p>Sports related jobs come with many hurdles even after finding employment. 

</p><p>If one has to exercise special privileges, it’s because they are competent but for some reason have not been discovered, or they have other problems that prevent them from following the regular route. 

</p><p>So, what is the right way to make good use of the benefits of graduating in Class A?

</p><p>Keisei, who has distinguished himself as a talented student in the class, opened his mouth to speak.

</p><p>“If we’re talking about Class A privileges, they should of course be used to find employment in a big company. Excluding the cases where you clearly have no talent, you’re not going to be fired if you just work as well as the others do. Isn’t that the best way to use Class A privileges when entering a world where the hardest part is making it in?” 

</p><p>Keisei’s classmates nodded with admiration after hearing his reasoning. When a company hires someone, they accept a large responsibility.

</p><p>As long as you don’t commit a massive failure, it’s impossible for you to be fired just because the boss doesn’t like you. 

</p><p>The existence of this newly built school that is unlike any other is also widely known after being officially recognized. 

</p><p>In that sense, one can elect to find employment in a large company and secure a long future there. 

</p><p>“Yukimura-kun might be right if we’re just considering efficiency. However, I think it’s important to aim for a job that you actually want to do.” 

</p><p>That’s also one of the correct answers. 

</p><p>One doesn’t have to decide how to live their one and only life with nothing but money and employment in mind. 

</p><p>Do you try to find your ideal job, or do you go after a realistic one?

</p><p>Only one future is waiting for me after I graduate, but it’s going to be a long time until I find out whether that was the correct answer or not also.

</p><p>Will I think I lived the right life, or not?

</p><p>The true answer will come out only in the end, when I look back on my life.
