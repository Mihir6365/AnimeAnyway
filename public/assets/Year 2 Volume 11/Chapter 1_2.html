<div class="main-body"><h3>Part 2</h3><p>It seems that my conversation with Hashimoto took longer than I expected. </p><p>“Sorry. Karuizawa is coming here soon, right? I guess I talked for too long.” </p><p>“It’s fine. It wasn’t a conversation we could have standing around.” </p><p>“I can consider this time well spent, right?” </p><p>Hashimoto nodded after I affirmed his question. </p><p>His expression had its ups and downs until now, but he looks more cheerful now. </p><p>He looks like he spit out the things that were stuck in his head. </p><p>I saw him off, and decided to head out myself.</p><p>“I’m going to buy dinner at a convenience store today”, I said to Hashimoto as I pushed the button to call the elevator up, and he quickly moved his fingers away from the up button and pushed the down button. </p><p>“Can I come with you too, then? I promise I won’t talk about anything too heavy.” </p><p>Naturally, Hashimoto looks very tired as well.</p><p>I want to end things on a lighter note, so I decided to go to the convenience store together with him.</p><p>We got off the elevator and entered the lobby.</p><p>Then, we ran into Hashimoto’s classmate Morishita, who probably just returned here. </p><p>“What a coincidence, Ayanokoji Kiyotaka.”</p><p>“Yeah, what a coincidence.”</p><p>I can feel the changes in my human relations in moments like these.</p><p>I passed by Morishita many times during my two years here.</p><p>Normally, we didn’t pay each other any attention, but now we’re at a point where we naturally start a conversation when we see each other.</p><p>“And what a coincidence to see the traitor here too, Hashimoto Masayoshi.”</p><p>“H-Hey, are you seriously starting off with that? Give me a break!”</p><p>“Excuse me, I forgot there wasn’t any conclusive evidence yet. I stand corrected.” </p><p>Her remark doesn’t change the fact that most students believe he’s the culprit. </p><p>He really is the traitor, of course, but I’m sure Hashimoto is also glad that I’m the one he’s with right now.</p><p>“I see that you’re not surprised, Ayanokoji Kiyotaka.”</p><p>“It’s already in the rumour mill. Besides, unlike the members of Class-A, I don’t hold a particularly strong interest in him.”</p><p>“Really? I was sure that this traitor was asking you for advice.” </p><p>She spoke her mind in rapid-fire pace, explaining her thoughts and suspicions without mercy and pushing further. I was admiring her courage when Hashimoto intervened.</p><p>“Stop it. You’re free to think I’m the traitor, but unless Princess instructed you to do so, you shouldn’t wrap up outsiders in this matter.”</p><p>He boldly stopped Morishita, speaking as if he really was innocent.</p><p>“Maybe you’re right about that. By the way, it’s already late at night. Where are you going now?” </p><p>Instead of pushing Hashimoto further, Morishita hit me instead with her question.</p><p>“To the convenience store. I’m going shopping for dinner.”</p><p>“Same here.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask Hashimoto Masayoshi, but alright. However, I thought you were the type of person who usually cooks dinner himself, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. Did you spend too much time talking?” </p><p>It’s true that I’ve been cooking more often than not recently, but where did she learn that information? </p><p>Morishita seems to be getting more and more suspicious, so she put her doubts into words. </p><p>“I just ran into Ayanokouji in the elevator. I guess he returned late because of the teacher-student meeting.” </p><p>Hashimoto responded in a light-hearted manner, perhaps trying to save me from further annoyance, Hashimoto responded in a light-hearted manner. </p><p>However, the doubt in Morishita’s eyes only grew further.</p><p>“That’s strange. I believe it’s already been some time since Ayanokouji Kiyotaka’s teacher-student meeting finished. So I guess you two were talking for some time.” </p><p>Perhaps she looked into the Horikita Class, as she seems to know information that even Hashimoto did not. </p><p>I suppose not giving her an honest answer was the wrong choice.</p><p>“No, this has nothing to do with me. I have no idea what Ayanokouji was doing.” </p><p>“But you’ve been with him since you ran into each other in the elevator on the 4th floor, correct?” </p><p>She glanced over at the elevator’s screen, as if signaling that there was nowhere to run now. </p><p>“Tsch, you saw….?”</p><p>“Perhaps others would not have paid much attention to it, so you’re unlucky that I’m the one who saw you.” Hashimoto forced a smile.</p><p>However, he didn’t look like he was shaken up by this encounter.</p><p>“So is this how traitors act?”</p><p>“Huh? What do you mean traitor!?”</p><p>“It means someone who betrays others.”</p><p>Hashimoto exaggeratedly dropped his shoulders after Morishita explained the meaning of the word.</p><p>“Give me a break Morishita, that’s a completely different matter.”</p><p>“Which matter?”</p><p>“I can’t say. There are some things that one can only talk with their buddies about. Right?” </p><p>He’s looking at me for agreement, so I’ll go along for now.</p><p>“So you’re saying it’s about gender, and that’s why I shouldn’t push it? That’s a convenient way to run away, isn’t it?” </p><p>“Ugh, it doesn’t matter what I say to you, does it?”</p><p>Throwing up his hands, Hashimoto shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>Just as we talked about earlier, this is a situation where the more he opens his mouth, the more suspicion he will draw. </p><p>“Well, it’s alright. More importantly, may I come along to the convenience store?” </p><p>“That’s fine, but why?”</p><p>“I’m sure I’ll find a reason. I’ll think of something on the way.” </p><p>She revealed that she had no reason for going to a convenience store, but we don’t have any right to refuse her anyhow. </p><p>She would just tail us even if we said no. </p><p>“Okay. Let’s go together, then.” </p><p>“So I can come along, right?”</p><p>Morishita quickly turned and took the lead as she walked ahead.</p><p>“What was that, man..? I never understand what she’s thinking. Sorry, Ayanokouji.” </p><p>“I don’t mind. It’s not a big problem.” </p><p>I randomly started thinking about what kind of an image Morishita has among Class-A. </p><p>I’m sure everyone is aware of her academic ability, due to the OAA. </p><p>However, other than that, I honestly don’t know. Perhaps I can ask her about it. </p><p>“What kind of a position does Morishita have in Class-A?” </p><p>“She’s exactly what she looks like. She’s smart, but she’s a weirdo, so she does everything alone.”</p><p>“You’re saying she doesn’t have any close friends?”</p><p>“Not that I can remember.”</p><p>That seems like a credible statement, considering the information-gathering nature of the person it’s coming from. </p><p>Looking at Morishita from behind, Hashimoto curiously put his index finger and thumb on his chin. </p><p>“That’s why I’m so surprised. She doesn’t usually start conversations like this.”</p><p>He glanced at me after muttering so, and I decided to beat him to the punch. </p><p>“She’s probably just observing the traitor, right?” </p><p>“Well… that’s possible too, but still… Also, you really don’t hold back, do you?” </p><p>“I do, if I’m talking to someone who necessitates it.”</p><p>“Ugh. I am curious about one thing. As far as I’m aware, Morishita is not a firm believer in Sakayanagi. She’s neutral towards her, and she’s not the type of person to actively try and solve problems on her own. In other words, I can’t see any reason why she’s looking into this.” </p><p>Morishita is not the type of person to actively try and solve problems? </p><p>Is that really true, though?</p><p>I’ve had little interaction with her, but the image I have of her in my mind is the opposite. </p><p>In fact, she rather seems like the type of person who would actively try to solve problems on her own.</p><p>Of course, Morishita changed her mind after Sakayanagi’s defeat, who had been winning so far, but it’s difficult to believe that Hashimoto would be unaware of this.</p><p>This man weaves truth and lies together and speaks without letting it on. </p><p>Perhaps even the three of us walking together right now was not a coincidence.</p><p>Hashimoto could have intended to indirectly make Sakayanagi aware of his contact with me.</p><p>If he didn’t want her to know, then he wouldn’t have done something that would draw any attention, like waiting in front of my room. </p><p>We both have each other’s contact information, so he could easily contact me in secret. </p><p>Whether directly or indirectly, his goal is to make Sakayanagi notice that he, the traitor, is in contact with me. </p><p>I currently can’t be sure of the truth, of course, but there is something I know. </p><p>Hashimoto’s truth and lies that he showed me in my room.</p><p>He believes that every action he’s taken is to his own advantage.</p><p>He wants to make only himself happy.</p><p>He wants to save only himself.</p><p>He wants only himself to win.</p><p>He doesn’t care what happens to anyone else on the way; that’s what he thinks.</p><p>For a pacifist, Hashimoto might seem like a detestable, bad person. </p><p>The more I get to know Hashimoto, the more I sympathize with him.</p><p>Because he’s living to his true nature.</p><p>In the first place, you need to be strong enough not to say yes or no, if you want to carry out such evil.</p><p>However, Hashimoto does not have that strength.</p><p>That’s why he learned how to blend in to his environment and change colours. </p><p>He’s trying to survive.</p><p>That’s what all of his actions so far have been about.</p><p>The three of us left the lobby and headed for the convenience store.</p><p>I entered the store, grabbed a basket and messaged Kei. </p><p>I asked her if there’s anything she wanted, and decided what to buy for dinner.</p><p>Even the side-dishes here that you can warm up and eat are pretty delicious.</p><p>As I continued shopping, I bumped into someone who entered after us in the beverage section. </p><p>“Ah….. G-Good evening…”</p><p>The greeting came from a girl in Hashimoto’s class, Yamamura Miki.</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting to see you here.”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p><p>Yamamura affirmed my remark with a somewhat embarrassed look on her face. </p><p>It seems that it was Yamamura who was watching Hashimoto from the fire escape after all. </p><p>Even after I left the dormitory, I hardly detected any signs of her and didn't know who it was. </p><p>So I thought it might be Yamamura, and it seems I was right. </p><p>The fact that she was on standby before I came back to my room by elevator also suggests that it is more likely that she was spying on Hashimoto.</p><p>Rather, it's more that I don't see any particular reason for Yamamura to hide and keep an eye on me at the moment.</p><p>“Oh, it’s Yamamura. What a coincidence.”</p><p>Hashimoto noticed us talking and came up to us with a curry-flavoured cup of noodles in his hand.</p><p>“Good evening… Hashimoto-kun.”</p><p>“First time I’m seeing you in a convenience store, Yamamura.”</p><p>Is he just making conversation, or is Hashimoto suspicious of something?</p><p>While uttering information that may or may not be true, Hashimoto watched Yamamura to see her reaction.</p><p>“Well, you know, I actually come here a lot… One, or two times a week… I just don’t draw any attention… I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Oh, no, I should be the one apologizing…”</p><p>Hashimoto was trying to probe Yamamura, but he ended up frantically apologizing after it came out like an attack on Yamamura’s lack of presence.</p><p>“This is a rare sight. Yamamura Miki, chatting with boys.”</p><p>“You’re one to talk, Morishita.”</p><p>“I’m at an age when I’m a little concerned about you, trai… Hashimoto Masayoshi. Love?” </p><p>“Stop constantly talking crap about me… Well, I’m sure Yamamura is also suspicious of me.”</p><p>Is that so? </p><p>Yamamura looked down to avert her eyes from Hashimoto’s gaze.</p><p>The heavy silence feels out of place in the convenience store with the light music, creating a strange dissonance.</p><p>It was not Hashimoto nor Yamamura who stopped this, but Morishita.</p><p>“Anyways. Let’s do some shopping together. That’s alright, yes?”</p><p>“Oh, ah, y-yes… If it’s okay with you, of course…” </p><p>The fact that she could not read the atmosphere from the start actually paid off here. </p><p>Without much of a back and forth, Yamamura simply ended up shopping together with us. </p><p>Well, there’s nothing strange about shopping in a convenience store in the first place. </p><p>I don’t have many opportunities to see Yamamura chatting with other students, and she seems to have a hard time even talking to her classmates.</p><p>Morishita pulled me by the sleeve and forced me to take her recommended products in my hand. </p><p>Unable to refuse any of them, I put three or four items in my basket.</p><p>“You shouldn’t push too hard.”</p><p>“Why not? Yamamura Miki always gladly accepts my sales talks.” </p><p>“I definitely don’t think she’s happy about it. She looks very troubled.”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>“Oh, err…”</p><p>Yamamura mumbled, perhaps not knowing who to side with.</p><p>“Are you saying I’m forcing him to buy these?”</p><p>“No, that’s not…”</p><p>Yamamura withdrew after Morishita pushed her just a little with her words, and she swallowed her words of disagreement. </p><p>“You think he doesn’t like this? Let me tell you my next recommendation, then. It’s a secret, okay?”</p><p>She was trying to get me to buy the next item again, even though she doesn’t work here. He tried to get some juice from a reach-in.</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt the friendly banter, but could you move aside for a moment?”</p><p>During this exchange, a new customer stopped by the drinks section.</p><p>Seemingly having noticed me but not Yamamura, her shoulders slightly bumped into her.</p><p>“Ah, s-sorry.”</p><p>This convenience store is not very spacious, so when several people are gathered together, they will inevitably get in the way of other customers choosing products.</p><p>It wasn’t much of a shock, but Yamamura apologized and gave way.</p><p>“No, it’s my fault I didn’t notice you. Sorry.”</p><p>She grabbed a bottle of green tea as her silver coloured hair swayed.</p><p>“I love this brand. You can really feel the flavour and aroma when you boil it in a small teapot, right Ayanokouji?”</p><p>The person talking to us like a beverage manufacturer’s representative is a Year-3 Class-B student.</p><p>“I never drank that brand before, so I don’t think I can answer.” </p><p>“That’s unfortunate. You should definitely try it if you get the chance.”</p><p>“Are you on your way back now, Kiryuuin-senpai?”</p><p>“Yeah. I’m a bit late. I figured I’d get dinner here for today. Is this female student here your new girlfriend?”</p><p>“No, she isn’t.”</p><p>“Oh, err… I’m Yamamura…”</p><p>“I’m Morishita Ai.”</p><p>“Yamamura and Morishita, huh? Same class as Ayanokouji?”</p><p>“No, they’re in Class-A.”</p><p>“Oh? It’s a good thing to have a wide network. Friends are important.” </p><p>“Should you be the one saying that, Kiryuuin-senpai?” </p><p>That line doesn’t fit someone who stands out from the other Year-3 students and lives a true life of loneliness. </p><p>“Hi Kiryuuin-senpai. My name is Hashimoto, I’m also in Class-A.” </p><p>Hashimoto wedged himself in while Kiryuuin was looking at Yamamura and offered his hand as he introduced himself. </p><p>Kiryuuin lightly brushed his hand off and nodded.</p><p>“I’m going to remember you three.”</p><p>After a short conversation, Kiryuuin paid ahead of the others and left the convenience store. </p><p>Kiryuuin usually doesn’t show much interest in others, so it may have been just a courtesy, but I was surprised when she said that she would remember these three.</p><p>Perhaps it was just a meaningless remark, though.</p><p>“I didn’t know you were friendly with Kiryuuin-senpai. Isn’t she famous for not hanging out with anyone else?” </p><p>“I wouldn’t say we’re friendly.”</p><p>Hashimoto continued to look at Kiryuuin for a while as she headed for the dormitory.</p><p></p></div>
