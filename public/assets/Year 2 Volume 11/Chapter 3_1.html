    <h3>Part 1</h3>

Mii-chan and I arrived at the convenience store promptly. 

</p><p>As I moved to enter first, Mii-chan gently tugged on my sleeve.

</p><p>“Could you wait a moment...? It seems there are other students nearby.”

</p><p>“You want to wait until it's clear?”

</p><p>“It's unlikely, but the person who assisted me might be here.”

</p><p>“I understand.”

</p><p>Her words were cautious, characteristic of Mii-chan. 

</p><p>It was only right to take them into consideration. 

</p><p>Although many students frequented the convenience store on weekends, their visits tended to be brief.

</p><p>After a short wait, the store cleared out in no time.

</p><p>“Shall we go in?”

</p><p>“Y-Yes!”

</p><p>The next customer would undoubtedly arrive if we stayed outside for any longer. We hurried inside the shop.

</p><p>“Welco—”

</p><p>The employee, a woman in her twenties whom I had seen frequently lately, paused mid-sentence upon spotting Mii-chan but swiftly resumed with a smile.

</p><p>“Welcome.”

</p><p>"Hello. Um, I'm sorry for running away the other day!"

</p><p>As Mii-chan bowed apologetically, the lady staff responded with a warm smile.

</p><p>"It's okay, it's okay, I'm not bothered at all. It must have been frightening, right?"

</p><p>It appeared that she empathized with Mii-chan's inner turmoil, prompting Mii-chan to nod several times.

</p><p>“Did your boyfriend encouraged you to come here?”

</p><p>“Eee?”

</p><p>Mii-chan, looking up, appeared puzzled.

</p><p>“What a supportive boyfriend. I'm envious.”

</p><p>“Ee, ee, eeee? My boyfriend?”

</p><p>“That's Ayanokoji-kun... right?”

</p><p>“How do you know my name?”

</p><p>“Well, we use student cards for store transactions, so I ended up remembering the names of some students.”

</p><p>Certainly, we use a student card, complete with a name and photo, for checkout purposes. 

</p><p>Given my frequent visits to the store, it wasn't unexpected that they would recognize me.

</p><p>“Also— weren’t you shopping arm in arm with a different girl the other day...? Uhh!?”

</p><p>“It looks like you think you are onto something, but you are mistaken. She's just a friend.”

</p><p>As I gestured towards Mii-chan and clarified, she nodded in agreement.

</p><p>“Oh, I see. But I thought there might be a chan—”

</p><p>“No! There isn't!!”

</p><p>For the first time, Mii-chan strongly denied any romantic involvement.

</p><p>Despite lacking romantic feelings for her, why did I feel a twinge of disappointment? 

</p><p>Mii-chan, who harboured feelings for Yousuke, certainly wouldn't want any misunderstandings to arise.

</p><p>“So, um, about the person I was looking for…”

</p><p>“Ah, yeah. Should I tell you? Is that okay?”

</p><p>The store clerk asked kindly, mindful of Mii-chan's emotions.

</p><p>“Yes, that's why I'm here.”

</p><p>“I see. In that case, I'll share the information.”

</p><p>After a moment of preparation, the clerk disclosed the identity of the individual Mii-chan had been seeking.

</p><p>“The previous shift leader couldn't recall his name, but he was quite memorable. When I heard the description, it clicked. It's someone from your class, Koenji... uh, Rokusuke-kun, I believe. It seems he was the one who purchased the items matching what you brought in.”

</p><p>“Huh...?”

</p><p>The name of the gift-giver—a detail she had been eager to uncover. 

</p><p>Koenji, of all people? 

</p><p>Why Koenji? 

</p><p>Mii-chan, beside me, undoubtedly appeared surprised, or rather, astonished. 

</p><p>It was an unexpected revelation. 

</p><p>Too unexpected. 

</p><p>Or perhaps it wasn't as surprising as initially thought? 

</p><p>While Koenji and Mii-chan had minimal interaction, there were instances when I observed Koenji displaying a somewhat warmer demeanour towards Mii-chan. 

</p><p>On its own, this might not have seemed significant, but considering the person in question was Koenji...

</p><p>“Um... Was it really Koenji-kun?”

</p><p>The clerk responded with unwavering certainty to her inquiry.

</p><p>“The shift leader described him as a long-haired, blond boy. He always carried himself with an air of superiority, often lost in his own reflection in the convenience store glass or fixing his hair with a hand mirror. And... the list goes on, but this sounds like Koenji-kun, doesn't it? I've witnessed him behaving that way too.”

</p><p>That was unmistakably Koenji. 

</p><p>There was no one else like him at our school, not at this moment, and perhaps never.

</p><p>“There seems to be no mistake.”

</p><p>“Yeah, even the contents of the gift match Koenji's style. It all adds up now.”

</p><p>“Yes…”

</p><p>Although she couldn't fully grasp the situation, she had no choice but to accept it. After thanking the clerk, we exited the convenience store. 

</p><p>Even after leaving, Mii-chan remained lost in thought, appearing dazed.

</p><p>“Koenji-kun...? Why?”

</p><p>“I have no idea. In a way, he's the person whose intentions are the least transparent.”

</p><p>“What should I do...?”

</p><p>Is she thinking on how to express her gratitude, or is she uncertain because it's Koenji?

</p><p>“But maybe you could overlook thanking Koenji?”

</p><p>“Eh, what!? No, I can't!”

</p><p>“But why?”

</p><p>“Well... He's our classmate, and he also spent a significant amount of money on the gifts.”

</p><p>Despite Koenji likely having a substantial number of Private Points, money was still money. 

</p><p>Mii-chan, being conscientious, couldn't overlook that.

</p><p>“I'm considering buying a thank-you gift. Should it be roughly equivalent to the amount spent on the gifts?”

</p><p>“That seems excessive. I think half would suffice.”

</p><p>It was ultimately a gesture of goodwill, so as long as the expression of gratitude was sincere, that should suffice.

</p><p>“O-Okay, I understand. I'll do that.”

</p><p>“Then all that remains is to ensure you thank him earnestly.”

</p><p>I was preparing to bid farewell and leave when—</p><p>

“Would you come with me?”

</p><p>“Pardon?”

</p><p>“To... Koenji-kun's place.”

</p><p>“I am not sure why you want me to go there, Wouldn’t it be weird for me to be there?” 

</p><p>I do feel like it would be too much for Mii-chan to go alone, but it still feels unnatural.

</p><p>Besides, I don't understand why Koenji gave the gifts anyway.

</p><p>“If the example I gave you turns out to be accurate, wouldn't it feel awkward? Even if I'm dating Kei, he might feel something if he sees a guy beside the girl he likes.”

</p><p>“But we are talking about Koenji, right?”

</p><p>“Koenji is still just a high school boy... Well not exactly now that I think about it.”

</p><p>If my presence makes him uncomfortable, then maybe I'm curious to see how it plays out.

</p><p>“Well then, shall we go together? Depending on the situation, I may leave after meeting Koenji, so please understand.”

</p><p>It’s possible that he might not like me being with Mii-chan.

</p><p>“I understand. Please do.”

</p><p>Mii-chan also understood that she couldn't expect more than that and nodded in agreement.

</p><p>“When should we do it?”

</p><p>Asked by me, Mii-chan took out her phone with her right hand and opened the calendar.

</p><p>Seeming uneasy, she occasionally touched the area near her hair tie with her left hand.

</p><p>“It's a sudden request, but would tomorrow morning be okay? If we wait too long, I might have trouble sleeping...”

</p><p>It wouldn’t be good to let her stay awake all night thinking about Koenji.

</p><p>Although I have plans with Kei tomorrow morning, we should be able to rearrange things.

</p><p>“Thank you for today. We'll be seeing each other again tomorrow, but for now, please accept my sincere gratitude.”

</p><p>With that, she bowed deeply. She also told me that she will express her gratitude again once everything was resolved, but I declined, saying it was not necessary.</p>
