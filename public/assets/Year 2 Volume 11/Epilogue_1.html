    <h3>Part 1</h3><p>
I opened my phone right after I walked out of my dorm and entered the elevator. 

</p><p>I’m expecting a call from the other party soon. 

</p><p>It would have been easier to check before leaving the room, but I didn’t want to make Kei worried. 

</p><p>As expected, there was already a call, but I was unable to answer, so there was also a message. 

</p><p>It looks like she went out to take a walk ahead of our appointment.

</p><p>Impressed by her behaviour, I decided to follow her. 

</p><p>Away from Keyaki Mall, close to the main gate, I found the back of a girl who was just wandering around.

</p><p>“Did you find anything?” 

</p><p>“Good morning. Unfortunately, I didn’t find anything special. The weather feels great, doesn’t it?” 

</p><p>The temperature is still low, but it’s a beautiful sunny day out and most of the snow has also melted. 

</p><p>“Thanks for inviting me out today.” 

</p><p>“The librarian told me you spend all day alone in the library, so I thought it would be a shame if you ended your winter break that way.” 

</p><p>I heard from the librarian that Hiyori rarely hangs out with her friends and goes to the library whenever it’s open until it closes. 

</p><p>That means she spends the entire day by herself until school closes.

</p><p>I didn’t want her to enter the third term alone like that, so I invited her out.

</p><p>Of course, I know that this is a satisfying enough routine for Hiyori. 

</p><p>She might even feel offended by my needless concern. 

</p><p>It could be too much pressure for her for me to invite her out like this… specifically, to hang out as friends.

</p><p>“Why did you call me out?”

</p><p>So, I have to be honest about this. 

</p><p>“I just wanted to invite you out.” 

</p><p>I just wanted to invite her as a person, nothing more and nothing less.

</p><p>Needless to say, Hiyori also has the right to refuse.

</p><p>“At first, I wanted to thank you for the book. I wasn’t satisfied by just giving you a gift or thanking you with words. I wanted to spend a day with you to make you happy.” 

</p><p>It’s a little suspicious to say these words to someone of the opposite sex, but I’m sure she’ll get what I mean. 

</p><p>“I’m happy to hear that.” 

</p><p>My soft words convey my gratitude. 

</p><p>Hiyori is probably smart enough to see this as an invitation from me, someone who feels sorry for her circumstances. 

</p><p>That preconceived notion can’t be easily wiped out, no matter how much I deny it with words. 

</p><p>Even so, she still agreed to meet up with me, which is why we’re here now. 

</p><p>So, all I have to do now is show her with my actions.

</p><p>I rarely act spontaneously when I’m with someone else.

</p><p>I let the other student take the lead most of the time and let him or her experience various things with me, but not today.

</p><p>I decided to take the initiative with Hiyori, but we’re limited in what we can do and where we can go within the school.

</p><p>“Umm, was it okay with Karuizawa-san? I don’t think she’s happy about you going out with a girl like this, is she?”

</p><p>Most people get worried when their partner is talking to members of the opposite sex, regardless of the situation. 

</p><p>This isn’t just with me, it’s a common thing with all lovers. 

</p><p>Of course, it’s not as if you have to check with your partner every time. 

</p><p>Only those who fear that spending time with the other person will affect them will speak up about it. 

</p><p>I’ve already factored in the fact that Hiyori is that kind of person.

</p><p>“She said that she wanted to go with me no matter what at the start. I was fine with that, but it wasn’t going to be fun with someone watching us. That would be rude towards you.”

</p><p>“How did you convince her?” 

</p><p>“I told her she could just read the book to create a common point between you two.” 

</p><p>Hiyori opened her eyes wide with a welcoming smile after that reply. 

</p><p>“You can guess how it went from the fact that she’s not here.” 

</p><p>“Oh… Yeah, I guess so.”

</p><p>She opened the book yesterday, but gave up on the first page and collapsed on the spot.

</p><p>“That’s why I got proper permission to come here. She was frustrated until the last minute, of course.” 

</p><p>Hiyori smiled and was relieved to know that Kei didn’t keep quiet about this.
