    <h3>Part 4</h3>

    <p>
        Kei left at 9 p.m after we hung out during the night, and I started preparing for tomorrow.

    </p>
    <p>The television was left open and playing a variety program, and I stopped for a moment to send a glance towards
        it.

    </p>
    <p>A man who appears to be around 40 years old is hosting the program while making jokes at the guests and making
        people laugh.

    </p>
    <p>They showed a remote location with people walking through town.

    </p>
    <p>The host then walked around the studio while imitating the video, and talked about his impressions for a while.

    </p>
    <p>Then, 5 different pictures were shown on the screen and the crowd started showing surprised reactions while
        trying to choose which one was a real picture.

    </p>
    <p>“Number 4.”

    </p>
    <p>I said the answer out loud and pointed the remote towards the TV to shut it off without waiting for the reveal.
        Silence immediately filled the once loud room.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kei loves TV, so she mostly turns it on when we’re together.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t have a strong opposition to television, but after trying out a few genres to check if I could learn
        anything from them, I found out that variety programs are the genre I like the least.

    </p>
    <p>I walked to my drawer, and took out my sketchbook and colored pencil set from the second tier.

    </p>
    <p>I purchased it with private points shortly after I first enrolled here, but I never touched it until now.

    </p>
    <p>Kei looked inside after finding it inside the drawer before, and I remember her strange expression when she found
        it to be completely empty.

    </p>
    <p>I spread the sketchbook on the table and opened the silver case of colored pencils.

    </p>
    <p>I reached out to the fresh coloring pencil set, and—

        I stopped.

    </p>
    <p>What do I draw? This is as far as it goes when you don’t already have an idea in mind.

    </p>
    <p>I thought I could just come up with something, but I’m having a difficult time.

    </p>
    <p>I learned many different skills in the White Room to increase my general knowledge.

    </p>
    <p>Tracing was one of these skills, and I certainly wasn’t bad at it.

    </p>
    <p>However, coming up with things to create on your own wasn’t part of the training.

    </p>
    <p>An empty sketchbook.

    </p>
    <p>I closed the silver case after looking at the sketchbook for a while.

    </p>
    <p>“I guess today is over already.”

    </p>
    <p>I returned the sketchbook and the coloring pencil set to my drawer while muttering to myself.

    </p>
    <p>Maybe Chabashira-sensei was right when she said the 3rd semester would pass by quickly.
