    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h2>Mingling Camp</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Thursday morning, 9:30. A group of buses parked on the field. </p>
    <p>Feeling the smell of gas from the buses on idle, the students began boarding them. </p>
    <p>Excluding the students who are going to tournaments for clubs and such, after the Uninhabited Island Test and the
        School Trip, the excursion this year is a camp across all school years. </p>
    <p>However, it is of a completely different nature than last year’s, other than being in the same category. </p>
    <p>So the title Special Test is not used this time. </p>
    <p>Before we start moving, what I’m curious about is the number of buses arranged for the students. </p>
    <p>There should be 1 bus for each class. </p>
    <p>So, 12 buses for every class if every class is participating. </p>
    <p>However, there were 9 buses in total waiting in the field. </p>
    <p>Looking at the students boarding them however, this puzzle is quickly solved. </p>
    <p>There is 1 bus for the Year-3 students. </p>
    <p>It seems there are very few students gathered from among them; only 20. </p>
    <p>I haven’t seen all of their faces, so I can’t be sure about this, but it looked like there were 5 students each
        invited from classes A to D. </p>
    <p>I boarded the bus as instructed, and it was explained that we could sit anywhere we’d like. </p>
    <p>Hearing this, Kei immediately hugged my arm. </p>
    <p>“I’m gonna sit with you!” </p>
    <p>While some of the boys stared at me with cold eyes, I gave Kei an affirmative reply and I sat down on the right
        side by the window, 3rd row from the back of the bus. </p>
    <p>Kei then sat down next to me. </p>
    <p>“Don’t you want to sit with the other girls?” </p>
    <p>“I’ll do that on our way back. We can sit together while going there, right?” </p>
    <p>We spend most of our free time together, and she wants to continue this on the bus as well. </p>
    <p>I’m not sure why, but she seemed to be more cheery than usual. </p>
    <p>After all the students boarded the bus and the other buses also finished their preparations, Chabashira-sensei
        boarded our bus as well. </p>
    <p>“This reminds me of last year’s camp. We had quite the exchange back then, didn’t we Kiyotaka?” </p>
    <p>“Yeah.” </p>
    <p>It’s been 1 year since that. </p>
    <p>Our relationship with Kei was not as deep then as it is now. </p>
    <p>My relation with the other people around me greatly changed as well. </p>
    <p>“Oh, right. I saw yesterday that they’re going to screen a movie I like. Let’s go together when it starts, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>Smiling and happily squinting her eyes, Kei showed me an image that seems to be a movie poster. </p>
    <p>This is a simple remark for Kei, with no other meaning behind it. </p>
    <p>However, one thing did feel peculiar. </p>
    <p>“When is that movie being screened?” </p>
    <p>“Err, I’m not sure. It said that it was a spring move when I checked earlier.” </p>
    <p>“I want to know a concrete date.” </p>
    <p>“Hm? Is there something on your mind? Err… Oh, it says it right here.” </p>
    <p>Kei looked at the homepage, where it said the opening date was March 26. </p>
    <p>Luckily, that’s before the start of the new semester, when the school enters spring vacation. </p>
    <p>“Okay. Let’s go see it.” </p>
    <p>“Yay! It’s super interesting, so I think you’ll have fun too.” </p>
    <p>Kei spoke with a smile on her face, but it quickly disappeared when she saw my face. </p>
    <p>“What’s wrong?” </p>
    <p>“Nu-uh, it’s nothing.” </p>
    <p>Replying so and averting her eyes, Kei started humming and looking at the preview page of the movie where it
        showed character details. </p>
    <p>After that, all the other students began chatting as they enjoyed the scenery outside. </p>
    <p>Around 20 minutes away from the inner city after our departure, Chabashira-sensei grabbed a microphone and looked
        at the students from the front. </p>
    <p>“I should start telling you more details about the camp now. I lightly touched on it at school as well, but this
        camp will be a 3 night 4 days stay in the form of a hands-on learning mixer.” </p>
    <p>Normally, this would be the time for the students to start getting nervous, but I can’t see anything close to
        that among the students on the bus. </p>
    <p>The students, while listening to Chabashira-sensei’s words, were still enjoying the scenery outside and resting
        their bodies. </p>
    <p>Another thing she had already touched on before is that this isn’t a special test, but is instead a simple mixer.
    </p>
    <p>“I’ll say this again, make sure you don’t see this mixer as a special test. There will not be any increases or
        decreases in class points. As long as you do not take any actions that are not allowed in your student lives,
        there is also no risk of an expulsion. You can earn some private points according to your participation in the
        games, but this is also in the form of a voluntary matter instead of mandatory.” </p>
    <p>It’s only natural that Chabashira-sensei would make sure to explain all this beforehand. </p>
    <p>The students have grown very cautious after their long education here. </p>
    <p>Their instinct is to wonder what’s behind it, even if they are being told this is only a mixer. </p>
    <p>That’s precisely why Chabashira-sensei is informing them that there are no special tests, changes in class
        points, or expulsion penalties. This relaxed the students a little. </p>
    <p>“It’s a shame that Ichihashi could not participate due to bad health, but it’s probably a blessing in disguise.”
    </p>
    <p>The flu is spreading around fast this time of the year, so there is a surprisingly high number of students that
        could not participate due to bad health. </p>
    <p>“I think some of you may have noticed this already, but while all school years are participating, it was decided
        that there would be just 5 representatives chosen from the Year-3 classes.” </p>
    <p>She had lightly touched upon this before, but she had not talked about it in more detail yet. </p>
    <p>“So your main goal will be to mingle with the Year-1 students, but I know it’s not going to work if I try to
        force you to get along with everyone anyhow. Firstly, the students will be split into groups of 20 after we
        arrive at the location. The 20 Year-3 students who will be the group representatives have already finished their
        discussions and have formed the groups made up of Year-1 and Year-2 students.” </p>
    <p>Which means that our groups will not be decided on when we arrive, but that they have already been decided and
        that we simply were not told. </p>
    <p>“I’m going to hand out the group lists now, so make sure you memorize which group you belong to. There are slight
        differences in numbers and gender ratios, but we made sure to have a tight balance of school years and classes.
        Games will be conducted in a group vs. group manner and there will be a winner and a loser.” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei handed out the printouts to the students sitting in front of me to the right and the left. </p>
    <p>The students took their share before handing the prints to the back rows. </p>
    <p>“The printouts also list other small rewards from the games and the conditions under which they can be earned.
        You should read through them too.” </p>
    <p>“I’m pretty relaxed since it’s not a test, but I do want some private points. Our chances are going to depend a
        lot on whether we get into good groups or not, right?” </p>
    <p>“Yeah.” </p>
    <p>It’s only natural that students will want to be in groups with as many excellent students as possible. </p>
    <p>Of course, which skills will be needed in order to win is still unknown. </p>
    <p>Hondou, who was sitting in front of me, stood up and handed me the printouts. Kei took one and handed the rest to
        the back. </p>
    <p>“I hope we’re in the same group, Kiyotaka.” </p>
    <p>There are 5 printouts clipped together, which included information about what the group would be doing, the
        rewards for the social event and the names of the students from the 5th page. </p>
    <p>I noticed that there was also a card folded in half, the size of a business card. </p>
    <p>Fortunately, the printouts were made specifically for this class, so the students in this class were marked for
        easy identification. </p>
    <p>This way, it's not that difficult to find your name. </p>
    <p>The names of absentees are also listed: two Year-2 students, Ichihashi and Ichinose, were absent, but four Year-1
        students were absent, including Ishigami. </p>
    <p>I think it’s a coincidence due to their ill health, but I don’t have time to think about that now. </p>
    <p>“I’m… in (c)naka-Senpai’s 7th group. I guess you’re not in this one Kiyotaka… but…” </p>
    <p>Why does Kei look disappointed but also relieved after immediately finding her name in the middle of the first
        sheet? </p>
    <p>“But what?” </p>
    <p>“We have to share a room with the girls in our group, so there’s some someone I wouldn’t want to do that with…
        I’m just relieved she won’t be here.” </p>
    <p>The first part of the printout stated that, in addition to the games, the required group activities would include
        sharing a room divided by genders. </p>
    <p>She didn’t mention a name, but she definitely means Ichinose. </p>
    <p>It may have been a valid strategy, but Kei was shocked when she was persistently targeted in the previous special
        test. </p>
    <p>“It’s not like I hate Ichinose-san or anything though, you know? But, err, I guess I’m a little scared of her.”
    </p>
    <p>She glared at me after muttering so. </p>
    <p>“You’re pretty friendly with her, so I had all kinds of suspicions too.” </p>
    <p>Kei whispered to me in a voice others couldn’t hear. </p>
    <p>“Is that why you had mixed feelings?” </p>
    <p>“She could have ended up in your group, right?” </p>
    <p>Surprisingly, it seems that Ichinose’s presence is getting bigger inside Kei’s mind, in a bad way. </p>
    <p>“I’m at the end of the 5th page, in Kiryuuin-senpai’s group 20.” </p>
    <p>A quick look at the list of all 20 groups shows that the gender ratio is balanced as much as possible, and that
        the number of students per class is basically two each, with a maximum of three and a minimum of one. </p>
    <p>This is probably to ensure equality as far as possible. </p>
    <p>However, I sensed an odd bias and inequality in certain parts of each group. </p>
    <p>Very few of the other students have noticed, as they are still searching for their names, but it is only a matter
        of time before questions erupt. </p>
    <p>Kei, who has not noticed anything, continued to idly look at the list, still disappointed that she could not be
        with me. </p>
    <p>Then, I looked again at the rewards listed on the first page. </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="bold">Group Ranking Rewards: </p>
    <p><strong>1st place:</strong>30,000 private points for each student </p>
    <p><strong>2nd place: </strong>20,000 private points for each student </p>
    <p><strong>3rd place:</strong>10,000 private points for each student </p>
    <p><strong>4th-10th place:</strong>5,000 private points for each student </p>
    <p><strong>11th-15th place:</strong>3000 private points for each student </p>
    <p><strong>16th-20th place:</strong>1000 private points for each student </p><br>
    <p>*Private points obtained in this mixer are non-transferable. </p>
    <p>*Usage is limited to shopping in Keyaki Mall. </p>
    <p>*To receive rewards, you must fulfill the conditions on your point card. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>If we focus on individual students, it seems that there are not huge rewards as there won't be any special tests.
    </p>
    <p>And it is not a system where only certain classes benefit. </p>
    <p>Even so, when it comes to extra income for high school students, whether it is 1000 Yen or 2000 Yen, they
        naturally cannot ignore it, so it is a basic desire to aim for the top ranks. </p>
    <p>The fact that they are non-transferable and that the places where they can be used are limited is a disadvantage,
        but, this just means that it is practically impossible to use them for strategies, which in turns means that
        each student may use it for themselves without hesitation. </p>
    <p>The students continued staring at the list for a while. </p>
    <p>“Umm…. Chabashira-sensei. Can I ask a question?” </p>
    <p>Sonoda raised his hand after the students mostly got a grasp on the groups. </p>
    <p>“You have something on your mind, right?” </p>
    <p>“Yes. If we play the games in groups, is this… fair? I mean, even if it’s impossible to make it completely fair,
        it seems a little unbalanced… that’s how I felt when I saw Nagumo-senpai’s group for example.” </p>
    <p>“That’s because the OAA balance is not taken into account at all. So it’s no surprise even if there are extreme
        deviations in the balance.” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei gave a quick and clear answer to the question. </p>
    <p>“Wow, it’s true. Nagumo-senpai’s group is pretty crazy, isn’t it?” </p>
    <p>Ike looked at the group lead by Nagumo after hearing the question, and started speaking. </p>
    <p>Nagumo is of course the former student council president, and he’s a student with A for every category on the
        OAA. </p>
    <p>However, the remarkable thing is the outstandingly stable lineup. </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="bold">Year-1 students: </p>
    <p><strong>Class-A: </strong>Takahashi Rie, Rin Todo, Amazawa Ichika </p>
    <p><strong>Class-B:</strong>Hagiwara Kazusa, Fukuchi Yonano</p>
    <p><strong>Class-C:</strong>Namekawa Azuki, Iguchi Yuri</p>
    <p><strong>Class-D:</strong>Obito Aoi, Osaki Noa</p><br>
    <p class="bold">Year-2 students: </p>
    <p><strong>Class-A:</strong>Sanada Kosei, Sawada Kyomi</p>
    <p><strong>Class-B:</strong>Horikita Suzune, Hirata Yousuke</p>
    <p><strong>Class-C:</strong>Kanada Satoru, Katsuragi Kouhei</p>
    <p><strong>Class-D:</strong>Kanzaki Ryuuji</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Each member either excels on the academic level and possesses high academic ability, or is able to follow
        instructions precisely and organize a group. </p>
    <p>In terms of personal skills, Sakayanagi, Ryuuen or Kouenji would take the lead, but there’s no telling how things
        will change depending on the way the students are mixed together. </p>
    <p>Going past that, this is probably the most versatile group. </p>
    <p>The other groups can’t help but feel down after seeing this. </p>
    <p>The students I used as an example earlier and their groups, such as Sakayanagi or Ryuuen might be able to make
        waves and beat the strongest groups, but most groups otherwise will not be able to avoid defeat. </p>
    <p>If there are games based solely on academic ability, the groups cannot win by overall skills. </p>
    <p>“I’m sure there are a few of you who think that the groups are unbalanced, but there’s no helping that now. It’s
        only natural that the best students are attracted to the most stable groups.” </p>
    <p>Holding a printout in one hand, Chabashira-sensei replied with a stern expression. </p>
    <p>Sonoda looked at her face and shriveled up. </p>
    <p>What Chabashira-sense said is irrefutable. </p>
    <p>Perhaps thinking that she came off as too threatening, the teacher softened her expression and smiled just a
        little. </p>
    <p>“But, it’s not a sure thing that the best students will win. Especially in this case.” </p>
    <p>She expressed to Sonada that there is still hope, and continued. </p>
    <p>“The mixer will be held over 3 days with the games being played in a round-robin tournament. Groups will be
        competing with each other, but the format is 1 group vs. 1 group, so the order the games will be played in is
        not public. Further, the games’ contents will be selected at random from the list.” </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei continued explaining the detailed rules after this too. </p>
    <p>In summary, these are the rules of the mixer: </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="bold">Mixer Hands-on Learning Games Summary</p>
    <p>Duration: Divided into 3 days</p>
    <p>Day 1: 5 Games</p>
    <p>Day 2: 7 games</p>
    <p>Day 3: 7 games</p>
    <p>*30 minutes per each game</p>
    <p>Contest method: Round-robin matches between all 20 groups. Order of play is secret. </p>
    <p>Rules: A representative of Year-3 students from each group will select five participants to play each game. </p>
    <p>Only Year-1 and Year-2 students may be selected for games as participants. </p>
    <p>The games will be 1 vs. 1, and the group with three victories wins the game. </p>
    <p>All five players will continue playing the game, even if their defeat is confirmed. </p>
    <p>There is no limit to participating in the games, and the students can take part as many times as they want. </p>
    <p>Game contents: Games are randomly selected by the school from the list, and the game’s contents are announced as
        needed. </p>
    <p>Winning conditions: Awards are given in order of highest victories. </p>
    <p>*If there is a tie for third place or higher, extra games will be played. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>As the name implies, the content of the ‘games’ seem to be very light. </p>
    <p>This is very clear after a glance at the list prepared by the school: There were games that require unique senses
        and skills such as pressed-flower making, pottery, card games like Uno, and even sports like table tennis. There
        are of course a few other things that require a little academic skill as well, but none of them are essential.
    </p>
    <p>There is also ikebana and bonsai, so I am very interested in this line-up of games. </p>
    <p>Further, it seems all of these games can be experienced at any time, even when there is not a competition. </p>
    <p>It is also possible to play the same game 2, or 3 times. </p>
    <p>Things became clear after the detailed explanation. </p>
    <p>Over these 3 nights and 4 days, the students will interact with their juniors while making things, playing games,
        competing for ranking and getting to know each other better. </p>
    <p>This may be tedious for students who hold no interest in such things, but I’m honestly very much looking forward
        to getting some experience making things. </p>
    <p>“You’ll find your point cards inserted in the printouts handed out in the bus. You can collect stamps by doing
        the various hands-on learning activities at the camp. Fulfilling these stamps is a condition for receiving
        rewards, so be careful.” </p>
    <p>So this is an item to encourage voluntary participation in hands-on learning activities. </p>
    <p>There are some rules, such as a limit on the number of stamps per day, and you also can’t receive more than one
        stamp from the same game, but I don’t think these are of any particular concern. </p>
    <p>At any rate, I want to try various things that I can’t usually do at school. </p>
    <p>Now that I’ve comprehended the contents of the games, I can see a way forward even for the groups with low
        overall ability on the OAA. </p>
    <p>Under these rules, I can say that every group has a chance to defeat their opponent. </p>
    <p>“I believe I’ve now conveyed the fact that there is no need to fuss over winning or losing this time. Of course,
        you can unite for the sake of the first place reward, but as you can see from the list of the games, the main
        focus is on experiential learning. You can focus on deepening your friendships with other groups through your
        active involvement in the games.” </p>
    <p>The school has given us various tasks and their rules so far, such as special tests. </p>
    <p>For the first time, they have given us the endorsement that we do not have to win. </p>
    <p>“It really feels a bit loose. Even the bottom rank gets 100 Yen anyway, so.” </p>
    <p>After hearing the contents, starting with Kei, most students are relieved. </p>
    <p>“Yeah. It looks like it won’t make a big difference whether we win or lose this time.” </p>
    <p>The students began acting in a friendly manner after the explanation. </p>
    <p>Some of them even started singing. </p>
    <p>“Although you have a certain degree of freedom, make sure you don’t forget to follow the schedule set by the
        school.” </p>
    <p>Well, that much is to be expected. </p>
    <p>I checked the schedule on the printout with Kei. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Wake-up: 7:00</p>
    <p>Lights out: 22:00</p>
    <p>Lunch break: 13:00 - 14:00</p>
    <p>Breakfast: 8:00 - 9:00</p>
    <p>Lunch: 12:00 - 13:00</p>
    <p>Dinner: 19:00 - 20:00</p>
    <p>Public bath: 6:00 - 8:00, 20:00 - 22:00</p>
    <p>Social events- Morning session: 9:00 - 12:00,Afternoon session: 14:00 - 18:00</p>
    <hr>
    <p>We’re mostly free at all times except the test times. </p>
    <p>In the extreme case, an individual may even choose to take a nap without eating lunch, or to immerse themselves
        in the experience of making things. </p>
    <p>This will not be the case if you are ordered by your group leader to participate in a game, but there seems to be
        no penalty for refusal. </p>
    <p>We were informed that it would be around 12:00 when we arrived on the first day, and from there we would gather
        in groups for lunch, with a social event to be held only in the afternoon. </p>
    <p>“Make sure you carry yourselves well as the seniors in the camp.” </p>
    <p>The explanation ended with that, and Chabashira-sensei took a seat after turning her microphone off. </p>
    <p></p>
