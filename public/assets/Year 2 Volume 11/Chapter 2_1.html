    <h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>
Chabashira-sensei left the classroom before the morning classes began.

</p><p>On days like this when we stay in the same classroom, everyone usually starts chatting, but the students instead gathered around Horikita this time, seemingly having no time for idle chatter.

</p><p>First, Yousuke took the lead in calming down his noisy classmates.

</p><p>“We have little time, so let’s just review the contents of the Special Test.”

</p><p>That’s what he said to avoid the commotion from getting out of hand.
</p><p>Just as one would expect, most students listened to him now after their experience in the last 2 years.

</p><p>Yousuke took the silence around him as agreement and continued after nodding.

</p><p>“One of my concerns about this Special Test is that it’s difficult to imagine a case where a class could finish at the bottom rank without at least one dropout emerging from them. And although there’s a low probability of it happening, there may be dropouts from multiple classes if they tie for bottom rank with the same ratio.”

</p><p>The number of attacks is 20 with 5 students chosen per attack, for a total of 100 attacks.

</p><p>No matter how good the leader is, a few students will inevitably fail.

</p><p>“Students who make a mistake on the second question will be in a tough spot. If we try to protect a specific student from dropping out of the test, the opponent class will naturally aim for other students. If we keep trying to protect students, then the number of students with 2 wrong questions will keep increasing…”

</p><p>This line of thinking will be very important to consider for our tactics. 

</p><p>The attacker analyzes the defender’s class, determines who is weak in what genre, and targets them accordingly. 

</p><p>They must figure out who is being protected and do their best not to let the defender earn any points. 

</p><p>The defender also has to read the attacker’s thinking and find counter-measures. 

</p><p>“We must note that the students with low ability won’t necessarily be eliminated. Other classes will want to eliminate the most capable students and expel them with the future in mind. If we make the wrong choice as a class in who to protect, even students with high ability will be at risk.”

</p><p>In the extreme case, everyone but the leader has a possibility of being expelled.

</p><p>It’s possible for even excellent students like Yousuke or Kushida to be expelled if they are continuously bombarded with assignments. 

</p><p>This would not be a wise strategy, of course, since it would be limited to a case where there are no other students to prioritize in protecting, and the class competition might have to be abandoned to put this strategy into practice. 

</p><p>If the strategy would succeed, then the damage caused would be far greater than the class points lost. 

</p><p>The rewards for this Special Test may seem modest with these factors in consideration. 

</p><p>The Special Test is focused more on making the loser worse off than the winner better off.

</p><p>“It’s natural that you want to avoid dropping out of the test after hearing this, but I’d like to use this short time to tell you not to be too anxious. Let’s start by coming to a unified understanding first instead of making a fuss while we still don’t know the true nature of the Special Test.”

</p><p>While conveying the fears that are apparent when looking at the Special Test on a surface level, she’s also telling the others that this isn’t all there is to it.

</p><p>However, these delusions will naturally spread if left unchecked. 

</p><p>Therefore, Horikita decided to gather her classmates in the classroom during today’s lunch break to discuss things further.

</p><p>She is not forcing anyone, but asked everyone to participate if possible.
