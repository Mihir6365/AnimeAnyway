    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>After travelling on the highway for about two hours, the mountains completely dominated the view outside the
        window. </p>
    <p>The bus halted at a different place compared to last year, and the students started to disembark. </p>
    <p>The space in front of the main entrance, where the buses were parked, was surprisingly spacious. </p>
    <p>The building designated for our camp stay resembled a traditional inn with a rich history. </p>
    <p>As explained by the school, it was originally constructed as a lodging facility and activity center during the
        economic boom period. </p>
    <p>Inside the building, there were dedicated classrooms for each activity. </p>
    <p>This explained the numerous experiential games mentioned in the earlier printout. </p>
    <p>"Gather in your assigned groups. For the next three days, follow your leader's instructions, engage in
        discussions, and get along with everyone." </p>
    <p>We were instructed. </p>
    <p>The 20 third-year students who were appointed as group leaders spread out. </p>
    <p>Right in front of me was Kiryuuin, her hands tucked into her jersey jacket pockets. </p>
    <p>"Well, see you later, Kiyotaka." </p>
    <p>Kei said, hesitantly moving away. </p>
    <p>I watched Kei leave for a moment before approaching Kiryuuin. </p>
    <p>"I look forward to working with you for the next three days, Kiryuuin-senpai." </p>
    <p>"Count on it." </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin's group, Group 20, included a total of 16 first and second-year members. </p>

    <p></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Kiryuuin was our group leader. </p>
    <p>The group seemed to consist of students who were good at sports and those who excelled in academics. </p>
    <p>Achieving such a balance in a competitive setting would be tough, but since this was a casual exchange meeting
        centered around games, it worked out.</p>
    <p>Among the second-year students, I recognized many faces, but among the first-year students, the only one I knew
        was Tsubaki. </p>
    <p>This highlighted the importance of holding an exchange meeting like this.</p>
    <p>“Hey, I never thought I’d end up teaming with you like this.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto remarked as the group gathered, approaching me casually.</p>
    <p>“I agree.”</p>
    <p>Just recently, I had many discussions with Hashimoto and the others, and it felt strange that the four of us from
        that day were now in the same group.</p>
    <p>“I’m both happy and disappointed. I wish we could’ve been together in some high-stakes special exam.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto added, indicating he had high expectations for me. </p>
    <p>I hadn’t mentioned if I could meet those expectations yet, but I left it at that.</p>
    <p>“Even if it's just an exchange meeting, I’d be happy to earn some decent money if I can come out on top. At the
        very least, exchanging contact info with the first-years is essential. I’ll invite you to join the group later.”
    </p>
    <p>It was helpful to have someone willing to take on the coordinating role—a time-consuming task. </p>
    <p>“I might delete your contact next month, though.” I joked. </p>
    <p>“Hey, hey, stop with the unfunny Morishita-like jokes.” Hashimoto replied.</p>
    <p>Although I made the joke, it did sound a bit like something Morishita would say. I wondered if his peculiar
        personality was rubbing off on me. </p>
    <p>Just then, a gentle voice interrupted my thoughts.</p>
    <p>“Good morning, Ayanokoji-kun.” </p>
    <p>Hiyori greeted as she approached the group.</p>
    <p>“Good morning. I’ll be counting on you starting today. It’s reassuring to have you here.”</p>
    <p>“I feel the same. I was relieved to know we’re in the same group.”</p>
    <p>Hiyori seemed to be universally accepted, unlike me, but she viewed the world differently from most. </p>
    <p>Having a dependable friend was genuinely comforting.</p>
    <p>“Hashimoto-kun, I look forward to working with you as well.” </p>
    <p>Hiyori added, giving a slight bow.</p>
    <p>“I always welcome cute girls. But you know, you two look good together standing side by side.”</p>
    <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
    <p>“Don’t take this the wrong way, but I think you two look more natural together than when you’re with Karuizawa.”
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps our shared interest in reading made it seem different from my relationship with Kei, but there was no
        need to take Hashimoto’s words too seriously. </p>
    <p>He had already shifted his focus to the gathered group. </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin, ignoring the group, stared at the winter mountains, prompting Hashimoto to take charge.</p>
    <p>“Um, is that everyone? Ah, no, are we one short? One, two, three—” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto quickly counted.</p>
    <p>“Fifteen, and sixteen including me. Looks like we’re still one short.”</p>
    <p>One short? I thought everyone was here. Was I mistaken?</p>
    <p>“There are 17 of us here. Yamamura Miki is also here.” I pointed out.</p>
    <p>“Oh, really, everyone’s here... Sorry, Yamamura.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto said, hastily correcting himself.</p>
    <p>“No... I’m sorry.” </p>
    <p>Yamamura apologized, despite just being overlooked. Her inconspicuousness was evident, being unnoticed by
        Kiryuuin and overlooked by her classmate Hashimoto, and it seemed even more pronounced recently.</p>
    <p>However, once I recognized Yamamura’s presence, it became oddly more noticeable to me, likely because I hadn't
        sensed her as much before. </p>
    <p>This might just be my perspective, though. </p>
    <p>When I asked Hiyori about Yamamura, she mentioned she had never really talked to her before, so I decided to
        introduce them.</p>
    <p>“We seem to be running into each other a lot lately.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, that's true. I look forward to...”</p>
    <p>“Nice to meet you, Yamamura-san.” </p>
    <p>Hiyori greeted her with a warm smile, which made Yamamura stiffen slightly.</p>
    <p>“Ah, yes. You're Shiina-san, right...?” </p>
    <p>Yamamura greeted Hiyori hesitantly, seeming a bit uneasy.</p>
    <p>“Oh? Do you have something you want to ask me?”</p>
    <p>“Ah—that... you're completely different from what I thought...” </p>
    <p>Yamamura murmured.</p>
    <p>“Me?” </p>
    <p>Hiyori tilted her head in confusion.</p>
    <p>“I thought you were more... indifferent...” </p>
    <p>Yamamura admitted, speaking softly.</p>
    <p>Yamamura, who observed people from a distance, had seen Hiyori differently. </p>
    <p>I had felt the same before getting to know her. </p>
    <p>“I'm sorry. I'm not good at talking to people, so I might’ve said something rude...”</p>
    <p>“It's totally fine. I'm not good at talking to people either, so we're similar.” </p>
    <p>Hiyori reassured her.</p>
    <p>“Is that... so?” </p>
    <p>Yamamura responded, though her eyes showed doubt.</p>
    <p>“You don’t see it? If so, I think it’s thanks to Ayanokoji-kun.” </p>
    <p>“Ayanokoji-kun...?” Yamamura echoed, puzzled.</p>
    <p>“Yes. Even though I’m not good at it, I’ve come to love talking with my friends. So I think you will surely come
        to love talking too.” </p>
    <p>Hiyori said, holding Yamamura’s hand.</p>
    <p>Hiyori’s claim that it was thanks to me was an exaggeration, but I hoped Yamamura would feel the same way
        eventually. </p>
    <p>With that, all the members of the Kiryuuin group were present.</p>
    <p>“Ayanokoji Kiyotaka. Nice to see you.” </p>
    <p>Morishita greeted me, using my full name without any honorifics but politely.</p>
    <p>“Nice to see you too.”</p>
    <p>“You’re—um... Shiina Hiyori, right? I’m Morishita Ai. Hello, hello.” </p>
    <p>She said, bowing slightly.</p>
    <p>“I’m Shiina. Nice to meet you, Morishita-san.”</p>
    <p>Starting with Yamamura, the second-year students exchanged light greetings, then began greeting the first-year
        students, who were nervously gathered. </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin, who had been waiting without intervening, finally spoke up.</p>
    <p>“Now that the greetings are over, let’s have lunch. Let’s disband for now.” </p>
    <p>“Wait a minute, Kiryuuin-senpai. Wouldn’t it be better for us to have lunch together to strengthen the
        camaraderie of the group?”</p>
    <p>Indeed, in that situation, Hashimoto’s suggestion was reasonable. </p>
    <p>Most groups seemed to be starting to act as a unit.</p>
    <p>“Then I’ll leave it to you.” </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin said, indicating she wouldn’t be joining us. </p>
    <p>She then left the group and disappeared into the inn alone.</p>
    <p>“Man, seriously? We've got quite a leader here.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto sighed, exasperated.</p>
    <p>“We can ignore her. I agree with the group lunch.”</p>
    <p>“That’s right. She said she’d leave it to us, so there’s little reason to disband here.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto agreed, deciding it was best not to overthink it. </p>
    <p>The first-year students looked confused, so he started acting quickly. </p>
    <p>Even if some first-years were reluctant to eat with their seniors, objections were unlikely except from strong
        personalities like Housen.</p>
    <p>“Wait a minute, hey! Koenji!”</p>
    <p>Behind Hashimoto, who was explaining things to the first-year students, there was a small issue brewing in
        another group nearby. </p>
    <p>Koenji, who was assigned to the sixth group, had wandered off without following the leader's instructions. </p>
    <p>The other second-year students in Koenji's group, familiar with his behaviour, didn't say anything to the
        confused first-year students. </p>
    <p>Even Inogashira, a classmate, looked worried but eventually let it go. </p>
    <p>For a moment, she and I made eye contact before she turned back to listen to her angry leader.</p>
    <p>“What’s Koenji-kun doing?” </p>
    <p>Hiyori wondered aloud, watching Koenji walk away.</p>
    <p>“He always does his own thing. I doubt he’ll come back.”</p>
    <p>“Really?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, Koenji Rokusuke doesn’t work well in groups. We’re used to it. My condolences.” </p>
    <p>Morishita added, clasping her hands together as if praying for the sixth group, already struggling with
        coordination.</p>
    <p>“If you were in the same group, would you have stopped him, Ayanokoji?”</p>
    <p>“Being in the same class, I know it’s pointless to stop him. I’d just ignore it.”</p>
    <p>If anyone could have stopped him by calling out, it wouldn't have been an issue.</p>
    <p>“Alright, the first-years are ready. Let’s go.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto instructed, and our group started moving without our leader. </p>
    <p>As we entered the inn, a slightly damp smell greeted us. </p>
    <p>It didn’t seem like a place that was used often. </p>
    <p>We walked in a line towards the cafeteria.</p>
    <p>With Kiryuuin absent, Hashimoto naturally took on the leadership role. </p>
    <p>During our lively group lunch, he led the conversation, engaging the hesitant first-year students and the quieter
        ones, boosting their spirits without any silly antics, and skillfully involving everyone in the discussion. </p>
    <p>For someone like me, who usually just listened, he was a lifesaver.</p>
    <p>“Um... Hashimoto-senpai. According to the rules of this exchange meeting, we don’t all need to be present for the
        games, right?” a first-year asked.</p>
    <p>“Yeah. Each game requires up to five participants, and the same person can play multiple times. It’s pretty
        flexible.”</p>
    <p>We only needed the required number of participants plus the leader to be present at the designated times.</p>
    <p>“Looking at Kiryuuin-senpai, it seems like she’s not interested in the exchange meeting. We can probably do
        whatever we want... but I wish she’d at least told us her plans.” another student added.</p>
    <p>Since the leader was responsible for selecting players, Kiryuuin was supposed to decide once the game details
        were announced. </p>
    <p>Hashimoto seemed annoyed that Kiryuuin hadn’t asked anyone about their strengths or skills.</p>
    <p>“For now, all we can do is try our best.”</p>
    <p>“Kiryuuin-senpai is amazing, isn’t she? Maybe she already knows about us?” </p>
    <p>Jitsute, a first-year from Class D, asked Hashimoto.</p>
    <p>Even if she didn’t know them personally, Kiryuuin's exceptional abilities were well-known.</p>
    <p>“That’s not possible. There’s no way she could know who in this group is good at something like flower
        arranging.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto replied skeptically. At this point, no one knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    <p>“There’s a reason I suggested we all eat together. Let’s rate our confidence in the game contents written on the
        printout on a scale from one to five. One means you’re not confident.”</p>
    <p>It was a simple yet necessary decision that the leader should have initiated. </p>
    <p>Everyone used their phones to rate their abilities for the various games. </p>
    <p>However, many activities were unusual and unfamiliar. </p>
    <p>If someone had never experienced an activity before, they could only rate it a one, and even if they felt they
        might be good at it, the highest rating they gave was a two.</p>
    <p>Moreover, there was no place to practice many of the activities in advance, making things requiring creativity
        particularly challenging. </p>
    <p>As they ate, everyone filled out their ratings. </p>
    <p>Some students finished eating by the time they were done.</p>
    <p>This way, we could gather data to guide our decisions. </p>
    <p>Hashimoto immediately shared the results in the group chat he created.</p>
    <p>“...This isn't going to work.” </p>
    <p>Hashimoto said after reviewing the data. </p>
    <p>Almost all students had rated their confidence as one or two for most games, with hardly any fours or fives. </p>
    <p>Hashimoto seemed to lose hope of winning.</p>
    <p>“Maybe we should just give up on the exchange meeting and just play around.”</p>
    <p>But it was too early to make that judgement. </p>
    <p>This phenomenon was likely happening in other groups as well.</p>
    <p>“I feel like there are fewer groups that are serious about it... Well, for now, I’ll show this information to
        Kiryuuin-senpai and let her decide on the plan.”</p>
    <p>In the end, everything depended on Kiryuuin’s motivation. </p>
    <p>If she was driven, the underclassmen would follow her lead. </p>
    <p>If she wasn’t, she’d just participate casually and relax at the training camp. </p>
    <p>Personally, I preferred taking it easy.</p>
