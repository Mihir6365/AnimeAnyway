    <h1>Afterword</h1>
<p>
I somehow managed to release it in 4 months this time; I’m Kinugasa with a hernia.
</p><p>I would like to thank you all for your continued support this year. They say a year goes by really fast, and just like that, one of my children is already starting primary school this spring.

</p><p>I believe that a child’s role in society is to play and have fun to the best of their ability every day at kindergarten or day nurseries, but I can’t believe that it’s already time for mine to start studying and jumping into society… As a parent, I am both excited and worried.

</p><p>Now, let me finish talking about myself and start talking a little about Youjitsu.

</p><p>Following the last volume, the story has entered the third semester of the Year-2 arc. After the tough events of the previous volume, I decided to deliver the story in a slightly more relaxed manner this time. And next time, we will finally be moving on to the last special test of the Year-2 arc, final special test arc. As those who already read this volume will understand, I’m planning a story that will have a significant impact on the main characters so far.

</p><p>And the Youjitsu TV anime’s 3rd season is currently airing. I hope you check it out as well!
</p><p>Finally… I would like to talk about the hernia in my neck, which I wrote about at the beginning too. I can’t really do anything about it, and my work pace has considerably slowed down because of it. Sometimes the pain even makes it too hard to keep sitting in a chair. If we assume the ratio of my hours used to be 6 hours of work and 4 hours of rest when I was healthy, I managed to compensate for the slowdown by working 9 hours and resting for 1 hour instead. I can’t keep this up forever though, and I think my body has reached its limit… So I’m considering taking a bit of a complete break and concentrating on my recovery. If that happens, it might be inevitable that the release of the next volume may be delayed. I will do my best more than ever before after I recover, so I hope you can be understanding. Naturally, Youjitsu will remain number 1 for me. But, there’s also many other things I want to do too.

</p><p>So, everyone, here’s hoping for a speedy reunion… See you soon!
