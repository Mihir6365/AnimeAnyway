    <h3>Part 8</h3>
    <p>
        The start of turn 15. Most of the classes are lined up closely now.
    </p>
    <p>First place is the Ichinose Class with 42 points.</p>
    <p>
        Second place are the Horikita and Sakayanagi classes, both at 40 points.
    </p>
    <p>Third place is the Ryuen Class with 39 points.</p>
    <p>We’ve bottomed out on our savings from the first half.</p>
    <p>
        We haven’t been pushed out yet, but we will be left behind if this trend
        continues.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Ryuen Class helped keep anxiety away at the start, but a dark cloud
        still looms over the class.
    </p>
    <p>
        The class was driven into a corner where it could fall to last place at any
        time, depending on how things go.
    </p>
    <p>“Are you kidding me? Give me a break.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to be expelled!”</p>
    <p>“Me neither, you know!”</p>
    <p>
        The students began to feel the danger after the number of eliminations
        increased to 4 after 1 more student got eliminated, and started causing a
        commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this situation, the others have no time to study either. Horikita pushed
        her chair and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
        She has to start naming her targets now, and she calmly walked past the
        students making a commotion.
    </p>
    <p>“No need to panic.”</p>
    <p>Horikita stood on the teacher’s platform and spoke to her classmates.</p>
    <p>
        “I know we’re in a terrible situation. There are currently 4 eliminations
        from our class. Ichinose-san took 1st place from us, and Ryuen-kun, who used
        to be in last place, is catching up extremely fast with consecutive perfect
        protections. I can no longer say that it’s certain we will win.”
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s a different story if she can figure out Ryuen’s strategy and stop his
        perfect protections, but there’s little hope of that happening.
    </p>
    <p>
        There’s also little hope of stopping Ichinose’s high rate of successful
        protections.
    </p>
    <p>“What we can do now, is to keep fighting until the end.”</p>
    <p>She cannot give a guarantee of victory at this point.</p>
    <p>
        However, in this special test where classes are competing with each other,
        the leader has to give some kind of guarantee.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s no use to speak in a weak manner, nor is it useful to pointlessly put
        on airs.
    </p>
    <p>The truth behind her words alone stabbed into the students’ hearts.</p>
    <p>
        Horikita believes they can get through this. That’s what she conveyed to the
        students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yosuke, who would usually follow up after her, is now quietly listening to
        Horikita’s words.
    </p>
    <p>“Trust me.”</p>
    <p>The class has to surpass this with a strong mentality.</p>
    <p>This is the only choice they have.</p>
    <p>
        However, from looking at Horikita, I feel that there is also something else
        at play here.
    </p>
    <p>Turn 15. The Ichinose Class’s attack.</p>
    <hr />
    <p class="bold">Defender Successful Protections:</p>
    <p class="italic"> Karuizawa Kei, Satou Maya, Miyake Akito</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Horikita successfully protected 3 students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further, the remaining 2 students answered correctly, giving the class a
        perfect score.
    </p>
    <p>5 points to let the class breathe again.</p>
    <p>However, the opponent’s persistent consecutive targeting did not cease.</p>
    <p>“W-What the hell..!?”</p>
    <p>
        Overwhelmed by fear rather than joy, Kei averted her eyes from the monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Including the students who have a faint grasp on the situation, even the
        students who don’t know anything started sensing something ominous in the
        face of this abnormality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Horikita didn’t seem to be feeling that way after succeeding in her
        protections, and the next turn came.
    </p>
    <p>The Ichinose Class’s attack.</p>
    <hr />
    <p class="bold">
        Defense Successful Protections: </p><p class="italic"> Karuizawa Kei, Nishimura Ryuuko </p>
    </p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>Two names this time, but Kei’s is also among them.</p>
    <p>“Stop… Why…”</p>
    <p>Ichinose is continuing to target and attack Karuizawa.</p>
    <p>
        It’s natural to reach the conclusion that she is intentionally trying to
        expel her while specifically attacking her.
    </p>
    <p>This move contradicts her image, but she isn’t stopping it.</p>
    <p>Turn 17. The Ichinose Class’s attack.</p>

    <p>She’s still not stopping.</p>
    <p>She won’t stop.</p>
    <p>No matter how many times she is blocked.</p>
    <p>She will never stop naming her.</p>
    <p>“Why does she keep naming me..? Why..?”</p>
