I sat down by myself. I probably waited for around 10 minutes.</p><p>The person I’m expecting showed up with slower steps than usual.</p><p>They usually pay more attention to their surroundings, but they haven’t noticed me yet.</p><p>“You took a lot of time to get ready, huh?”</p><p>They were surprised when I spoke up, but quickly hid it. </p><p>“Were you waiting for me..?” </p><p>“I forgot to ask about your current state of mind.” </p><p>“I see. You don’t get a lot of opportunities to see a defeat for Class-A, after all.”</p><p>“You were never behind in the battle of predictions. You also accurately exploited the other classes’ weaknesses, and predicted things well during your defense too. It looks to me like you were far ahead of the 3 other leaders.”</p><p>“And I ended up losing, so your words are nothing to smile at.”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>“It’s a shame, though, because nothing about my mental state has changed. It would be a different story if the cause of the defeat was my lack of ability, but it is not so.”</p><p>“That may be true about your defeat, but it’s a different story when it comes to the expulsion, is it not?”</p><p>“If there are eliminations in a class, there will be an expulsion. I knew that from the start.”</p><p>Sakayanagi didn’t admit it until the end, but I continued. </p><p>“Still, for you, a defeat - no, Kamuro’s expulsion must have been outside your plans.”</p><p>“Don’t underestimate me. It’s true that Kamuro-san worked for two years by my side, but she wasn’t a student I couldn’t throw away, nor a particularly obedient one. Expelling someone like that has no effect on the class.” </p><p>She replied while emphasizing how wrong I was. </p><p>“This isn’t like you, Sakayanagi. You seem very different compared to your usual presence of mind.”</p><p>“Not like me? I don’t think so.”</p><p>“You should have already noticed it when I turned my suspicions to you here.”</p><p>If Kamuro’s expulsion hadn’t affected Sakayanagi in any way, I wouldn’t have been waiting here.</p><p>I wouldn’t have gone out of my way to shake things up like this for no reason.</p><p>“You do have a high ability of perception, but aren’t you being overconfident?”</p><p>“Who knows?”</p><p>When I pointed out that I wasn’t going to change my way of thinking, Sakayanagi also looked a little confused.</p><p>“Kamuro-san’s expulsion has affected my state of mind. Is that what you want to say?”</p><p>“To put it clearly, yes.”</p><p>“That’s not possible.”</p><p>“I understand you don’t want to admit it, because you would also be admitting that you made a wrong choice.”</p><p>That would make her regret not having chosen a different student than Kamuro.</p><p>“You know that you’re strong. So you can’t empathize much with someone else’s weaknesses. You have a tendency to be unable to relate to the vulnerability of others.”</p><p>“That’s not something I want to hear from you, Ayanokoji-kun.”</p><p>“It’s true some parts of that are true for me too, but you’re only halfway there. Because you possess human feelings, you can’t help but understand a part of them.” </p><p>We have many common points, but also quite a few differences. </p><p>“I don’t understand. What are you trying to say, I wonder? Are you saying I should have been weaker? Was I supposed to behave in a selfish way because I wanted Masumi-san to remain?” </p><p>“A normal leader wouldn’t be allowed to make a selfish decision. But that’s what you should have done, while keeping winning in the future in mind. Allowing Kamuro to remain here was the right choice in order to make you stronger. You should have come up with another reason to expel a different student, like by OAA or something else.”</p><p>However, her own pride got in her way.</p><p>After an unexpected loss, she feigned calmness and made the erroneous choice of deciding it’s fine for anyone to disappear.</p><p>A part of herself that she lost won’t come back.</p><p>From now on, Sakayanagi has to keep fighting while partially missing something.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Her presence never had any influence on me. I will never lose again.”</p><p>“You probably will. If you challenge the finals like this, that will be a repeat of today.”</p><p>Sakayanagi doesn’t accept it, but the situation has greatly changed.</p><p>“I see, I understand your aim. You want me to have received some damage. So, you want to make me believe this matter has weakened me. That’s why you’re trying to psychologically shake me up , am I wrong?” </p><p>“Why would I want you to have gotten weaker?” </p><p>“It’s inconvenient for you if Class-A is surpassing the others, isn’t it? You want to enter Year-3 while putting the 4 classes in a situation of close competition, in order to create your own ideal developments. That’s your objective, is it not?” </p><p>“You’re not completely wrong, but that’s not enough.” </p><p>“What am I wrong about?”</p><p>“At this time, whether Class-A is in the lead or not isn’t a big issue for me. My objective is to make each class rise up to their full potential. For that, I will intervene with anybody I have to, whether it’s Ryuen, Ichinose, or you.”</p><p>“I don’t like that. It sounds like you’re saying I need to receive your help.”</p><p>“That’s why I’m here. Helping you is why I’m standing here.”</p><p>Sakayanagi’s eloquent opposition came to an end here. </p><p>Sakayanagi is smart in the first place. </p><p>She understood from the start. She just pretended not to.</p><p>“Your mistake is not seeing that Kamuro’s presence was a lot more important than it appeared to be on the surface. You thought that she was no different from any other student, no, you convinced yourself of that, and made your decision by something trivial like a lottery.”</p><p>It’s no use crying over spilled milk. </p><p>She should have been honest with herself, even if it meant antagonizing others.</p><p>Of course, her conceit and carelessness in believing she could not be defeated also contributed to this error.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>No longer able to look me in the eyes, Sakayanagi averted her gaze.</p><p>She then looked far off in the distance and quietly sighed.</p><p>“I spent primary and middle school years in compulsory education, and, frankly, I never made one friend. I could never stay in step with someone I deemed to be childish and on a lower level of intelligence than me.”</p><p>She reflected on her childhood, saying she was always like this.</p><p>“It’s the same in this school. It’s the same with Masumi-san, Hashimoto-kun, and Kitou-kun too. I positioned them close to myself, but that’s only because they’re reliable workers. I never thought anything more or less than that about them. I thought they were the same as strangers.” </p><p>Sakayanagi spent her student life not recognizing those by her side as her friends.</p><p>However, boundaries between friends and strangers are blurry. No one can measure the true line.</p><p>“That’s why I thought it didn’t matter who goes away, but…” </p><p>Her words stopped there.</p><p>She can see the true answer, which she can’t ignore any more. </p><p>“It appears that, without realizing it, I started seeing Masumi-san as a friend.”</p><p>She used the word ‘friend’ again, but it sounded a lot heavier now compared to earlier.</p><p>The word’s meaning greatly changes depending on whether she admits this from the heart, or not.</p><p>She had simply convinced herself that someone wise like her would never be swayed by someone like that.</p><p>“...At any rate, this isn’t like me, huh?”</p><p>“Maybe so, but I see something now. Now that you’ve gotten weaker by losing Kamuro, you will become even stronger than before.”</p><p>I hope that this affair is on a level where she can face forwards and stand back up again.</p><p>“You’ve always been giving people advice like this behind the scenes, right? That’s why everyone’s showing growth.”</p><p>“It isn’t enough yet, but yes.”</p><p>Without saying anything more, Sakayanagi slowly and gently lowered her head.</p><p>She couldn’t stay here with me any longer. </p><p>That’s what I felt from her gesture.</p><p>I saw her off while looking at her tiny back, and sat back down on the bench.</p><p>“In the end, Kamuro’s expulsion turned into a positive factor.” </p><p>No other student could have affected Sakayanagi’s emotions in this way.</p><p>Plus, without me even controlling the field, the classpoints were condensed all across the board.</p><p>This is proof that each class has gotten stronger and is able to fight better.</p><p>After this, Sakayanagi will have to think well, notice some things and show some big growth.</p><p>She should be beginning to face the emotions that she had never felt before.</p><p>Ryuen unmasked himself and moved forward.</p><p>He isn’t changing his previous way of doing things, but instead further channelling himself on that uniqueness.</p><p>He will continue mercilessly showing his power against his surroundings.</p><p>There are around 2 months until the finals.</p><p>“I should start getting on with my preparations too.”</p><p>Karuizawa Kei.</p><p>Ichinose Honami.</p><p>Then, my class.</p><p>I will begin moving in order to make sure that the school life we have remaining will be left in the memories of those around me.</p><p></p></div>
