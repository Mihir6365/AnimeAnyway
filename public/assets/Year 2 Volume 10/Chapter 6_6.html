He will never stop until then. </p><p>Immediately after the second half began. </p><p>Ryuen, who had been targeting Sakayanagi’s mainline throughout every turn so far, stood up. </p><p>“Now then, let’s begin. Move.” </p><p>“Hey, wait, what!?” </p><p>Ryuen pushed the teacher in charge, Hoshinomiya away, and sat down on the teacher’s seat. <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 10/Images/image6.webp" alt=""></p><p>“The second half. The score difference is only 10 points. In other words, we can catch up if we get a perfect score a few times. You guys aren’t going to disappoint me, are you?” </p><p>The leader pressured the other students, implying that he would not forgive anyone for making a mistake, no matter what subject they face. </p><p>Of course, things would be all too easy if such threats alone were enough to increase the ratio of correct answers. </p><p>“Are you kidding me? This isn’t just about this class. Other classes have to know that it’s going to be difficult to get a perfect score too, Ryuen. If you’re supposed to be our leader, then you have to make sure you can protect as many students as possible.” </p><p>Tokitou was not afraid to voice his frustration, even as most of the other students were unable to say anything back. </p><p>“Heheh. Yeah, I know it’s the end for you if you get a question wrong for the second time. If you get eliminated, someone rebellious like you will be nominated for expulsion pretty quickly.” </p><p>“...” </p><p>“I was lying when I said I expected you guys not to disappoint me.” </p><p>Ryuen turned around, and checked to see if the display on the monitor had changed. </p><p>Sakayanagi finishing her nominations was announced, and it was now Ryuen’s turn to answer with his 5 protection slots. </p><p>His opponent’s chosen genre is Sports. Further, she spent 2 points to choose difficulty 3. </p><p>She won’t give the Ryuen class even 1 point. </p><p>The students felt desperate in the face of this merciless attack from Class-A. </p><p>However, Ryuen alone was laughing, as if he enjoyed this development. </p><p>“I choose Katsuragi, Shiina, Tokitou, Yamura, and Ibuki. Make it quick.” </p><p>He showed no concern for the genre or difficulty. </p><p>He immediately gave the 5 names, as if he didn’t even look at the genre and difficulty. </p><p>“H-Hey, stop ordering your teacher around… Good grief.” </p><p>Hoshinomiya said frantically, as she finished typing the 5 names given to her by Ryuen. </p><p>Perhaps Ryuen wanted to avoid being tricked by Sakayanagi’s strategy by refusing to think about his moves. </p><p>This is what some of the students were thinking as the results were displayed. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Defender Successful Protections: </p><p class="italic">Katsuragi Kouhei, Shiina Hiyori, Tokitou Hiroya, Yamura Takeji, Ibuki Mio</p><hr /><p>“W-What..?” </p><p>Tokitou was still standing around after Ryuen glared at him, but he was astonished at the results. </p><p>Perhaps the immediate response was effective, as the protections were a perfect success. </p><p>“Gambling’s a nice thing, ain’t it? You just throw the dice at random.” </p><p>Turn 12. </p><p>Ryuen immediately gave his 5 names for the protection slots again. </p><p>As a result, every protection succeeded again, displaying an astonishing pursuit from Ryuen. </p><p>Turn 13 and turn 14 went the same way. </p><p>Even when Sakayanagi changed her targets, Ryuen’s protections continued hitting the target like guided missiles. </p><p>“Heheh. Looks like you have no idea what to do now, Sakayanagi.” </p><p>Since the start of this special exam, Ryuen had been paying attention to a completely different point than the other leaders. </p><p>How much can a beast hide its smell? </p><p>How long can it chase its prey with fangs readied, while not letting her realize what’s happening? </p><p>That was all he thought about. </p><p>The other classes couldn’t do anything now. </p><p>Ryuen was confident after pulling through the first half, and now he was determined to go on the offense to turn the tables around. </p><p>“What’s happening..!?” </p><p>There’s certainly something at play here. </p><p>However, even the teacher in charge, Hoshinomiya, could not understand what the trick was. </p><p></p></div>
