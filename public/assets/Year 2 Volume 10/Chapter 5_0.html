    <h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
On Thursday morning, the day preceding the special exam, we were granted an unexpected day off. 

</p><p>Usually, falling asleep posed no challenge, but I, Hashimoto, experienced an unusually restless night.

</p><p>“Lack of sleep really takes its toll... So sleepy…”

</p><p>Struggling to lift myself up, I noticed a message from Kito on my phone.

</p><p>[It appears the princess has finally settled on a strategy.]

</p><p>Even on the eve of the exam, it seemed they were finally convening the class leaders for a discussion. 

</p><p>However, I doubted they would divulge detailed information about the strategy. 

</p><p>Sakayanagi always operated independently, sharing only essential information with the students she utilized as her pawns.

</p><p>“Tsk…”

</p><p>In addition to Kito's message, I found dozens of messages from the girl I was currently dating. 

</p><p>I recalled exchanging messages with her until late into the night, but eventually gave up due to the conversation’s nature.

</p><p>[Where should we go next?]

</p><p>[I'm craving this and that.]

</p><p>[What are your likes and dislikes?]

</p><p>[I miss you and feel lonely.]

</p><p>It all seemed so trivial.

</p><p>[Apologies, I fell asleep. I'll make it up to you next time.]

</p><p>With a cute emoticon, I sent back the somewhat indifferent response, assuming it would suffice to satisfy her.

</p><p>If she persisted, I could simply end things with her, but there were still some details I needed to gather. 

</p><p>Regardless of the class or the triviality of the information, there was never too much to know. 

</p><p>Let's set aside thoughts of that woman for now and focus on the matter concerning Sakayanagi. 

</p><p>It was directly linked to the reason I struggled to sleep last night—the question of how we should approach the special exam.

</p><p>And even before that, we needed to consider our preparations. 

</p><p>With the year-end exams looming closer, my anxiety escalated day by day. 

</p><p>The prospect of potentially losing to Ryuen in a direct clash with significant class points at stake haunted me. 

</p><p>This was a scenario I absolutely had to avoid. 

</p><p>I must do everything within my power to prevent it, mustn't I?
