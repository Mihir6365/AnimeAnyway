    <h3>Part 2</h3><p>
I was heading to Class-D in order to check up on Ryuen, who is probably boiling with delight right now, and spotted Hiyori when I arrived near the classroom.

</p><p>She seemed to be looking downstairs through a window.

</p><p>I felt curious when I noticed the stiff expression on her face, unlike her usual soft smile, and I looked downstairs from the same window as well.

</p><p>It’s Ryuen and a few of his followers. The one standing out is Ishizaki, jumping around and swinging his hands to display his joy.

</p><p>Then, I noticed Katsuragi, who was ignoring the others’ flashy demeanour and heading towards Keyaki  Mall. 

</p><p>I did catch a side glimpse of his face, and he had his usual stern expression without any softness on his face. 

</p><p>“I guess they’re enjoying the taste of victory.” 

</p><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they lived it up in Keyaki Mall for today.

</p><p>“It looks like it.”

</p><p>Hiyori agreed with my words in a natural tone of voice.

</p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to join them?”

</p><p>“They did invite me, but I refused today.”

</p><p>“Why?”

</p><p>“I guess I just don’t feel like celebrating, for some reason.” 

</p><p>Hiyori is probably the only one not smiling among the joyous students.

</p><p>“Looking at Ryuen’s way of fighting, and his way of thinking today, I feel a little uneasy.”

</p><p>“He came first in a race where the odds were stacked against him. I don’t think you could ask for a better result than this.”

</p><p>“If you look at the results alone, sure.  But…”

</p><p>Hiyori hesitated to put it into words for a moment, but continued after a few seconds.

</p><p>“I'm still not sure if he can keep winning by doing this every time.”

</p><p>“Yeah, it wasn’t a frontal attack. He stamped down on the skills of his class.”

</p><p>Ryuen honed his ability to bet on the bizarre as an individual, but that’s all. 

</p><p>“It worked out this time, but we can’t build up from this to help us win next time. I’m not saying he should have lost, but we lost an important chance for growth.”

</p><p>“You may be right.”

</p><p>However, fresh blood may need to flow in order for that to happen.

</p><p>“He’s both an important piece for our rise to Class-A, but also an impediment. That’s a problem, isn’t it?”

</p><p>Hiyori can clearly see the weaknesses of her class. 

</p><p>A strength that depends on Ryuen’s presence. 

</p><p>On the other hand, there is also a weakness born from Ryuen too.

</p><p>“There’s a student who’s noticed this, so there’s still hope.”

</p><p>I just wanted to do a brief victory interview, so I have no intentions of pushing further and bothering her.

</p><p>Hiyori was heading for the library, and she invited me along, still with a worried expression, but I decided to refuse for today.

</p><p>Because I wanted to check up on the Ichinose and Sakayanagi classes too.

</p><p>As for the Ichinose class, things are mostly the same without any changes for the better nor for the worse. 

</p><p>On top of naturally avoiding last place, they also created a concrete guarantee for the students by keeping eliminations at 0. 

</p><p>A style of fighting where you refuse to abandon anybody has its own risks, but the class got 2nd place as a result.

</p><p>She read Horikita’s aim and acted to create 5 students in risk of elimination. 

</p><p>Then, she allied with Ryuen in the second half, which should have been negotiated for at an earlier stage, and had 0 eliminations. 

</p><p>Further, she also assisted Horikita to make sure Sakayanagi would sink to last rank.

</p><p>I can say that she made the best moves possible for a class standing in the middle of the pack.
