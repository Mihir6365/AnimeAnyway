They didn’t give up the first rank for 10 turns during the first half. However, we have to focus on the Special Test without letting that distract us too much. All we can do to earn more points is to solve the problems as they come.” </p><p>Horikita is attacking the Sakayanagi class, which is seen as the most dangerous one among the other 3. </p><p>She successfully protected many students while under attack by Ryuen during the first half, and the students also had a very high rate of correct answers. </p><p>“How will we attack?”</p><p>Horikita looked around the classroom before replying to Sudou.</p><p>There might be students here with a connection to Sakayanagi.</p><p>If so, she naturally can’t talk about her strategy out loud so easily.</p><p>“Perhaps you remember that I asked everyone for their opinions during the preparation period. I’ve sorted the information I gained then, and found gaps in our opponent’s defenses.” </p><p>Simple is best.</p><p>It seems she will try to target each student’s weakness instead of focusing on a battle of prediction. </p><p>However, even in comparison to the Ichinose Class, I have the impression that there is very little information about this class going around, and I’m sure they paid extra attention to making sure nothing would leak out after the special test’s announcement. </p><p>If so, then it is no easy task for someone to find out about the class’s strong and weak points. </p><p>Horikita alone knows how effective the information her opponents did find out would be. </p><p>Horikita is attacking the Sakayanagi Class on the beginning of turn 11.</p><p>She spent 1 point at the start to choose the Literature genre at difficulty 2. </p><p>While 1 student was unfortunately protected, 3 students out of the 4 who had to challenge the difficult subject got their answers wrong, so Horikita was able to stop her opponent from gaining more than 2 points. </p><p>If we get 3 points in exchange for the 1 point she spent in order to raise the difficulty, we’ll be even. If we score 4 or more, we’ll be ahead. </p><p>It’s Sakayanagi’s turn to attack now, but she might feel a little pressure. </p><p>She suddenly spent 2 points to choose Sports at difficulty 3.</p><p>She’s mercilessly attacking Ryuen, who is already at the bottom rank.</p><p>“It looks like she’s trying to drive Ryuen down to the bottom as much as she can… Very aggressive.” </p><p>She started the second half off in a strange way, not caring about the point difference between her and Class-B. </p><p>Immediately afterwards, however, the class sounded very surprised when they saw the results on the monitor. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Defense Successful Protections: </p><p class="italic">Katsuragi Kouhei, Shiina Hiyori, Tokitou Hiroya, Nomura Takeji, Ibuki Mio </p><hr /><p>For the first time in this special test, a class gained a perfect score of 5 by protection slots alone.</p><p>Choosing difficulty 3 came to naught after everyone was protected. That was a big blow. </p><p>On the other hand, while temporarily, Ryuen caught up to Ichinose with 24 points after his slow start. </p><p>“Even if they have the most eliminations at 4 students… This result is still an overkill.” </p><p>This must be a shock, as I’m sure everyone expected Ryuen to keep falling behind. </p><p>It looked like this momentum would carry forward, but during Ryuen’s attack on the Ichinose Class, she successfully protected 3 students. </p><p>However, one student got the answer wrong, so she stopped at 4 points resulting in a total of 28. </p><p>This class is still waiting to defend, but the gap was closed in an instant. </p><p>I wonder which genre and targets Ichinose will choose for her attack.</p><hr /><p class="bold">Genre: </p><p class="italic">Sports <p class="bold">Difficulty:</p></p><p class="italic">1 <p class="bold">Defender Successful Protections: </p><p class="italic">Wang Mei-Yu, Shinohara Satsuki. </p><p class="bold">Attacker Targets: </p><p class="italic">Ayanokoji Kiyotaka, Miyamoto Soushi, Karuizawa Kei </p><hr /><p>The first name on the Ichinose Class’s target list is my own. </p><p>This could be a coincidence or intentional, but Kei’s name is also in the list. </p><p>I can’t say whether I’m good or bad at the subject of Sports at difficulty 1. </p><p>I’m confident I can make a good guess based on history and rules, but this will be a disadvantageous development for me if the question is about a current event. </p><p>On the other hand, however, as she watches TV, it is possible that Kei may solve a question regarding worldwide events. I’ve heard during a few conversations that she often watches volleyball matches. </p><hr /><p class="italic">“When there are less than one out and the runners are on first, second, and third base, what do you call a fly ball hit by the batter that can be caught if the infielder performs normal defensive manoeuvres?” </p><hr /><p>It looks like the question is about a rule.</p><p>Thankfully, I have learned a suitable amount of rules for a variety of sports, so I can answer this without much difficulty. </p><p>The correct answer is ‘infield fly ball’.</p><p>However, leaving Miyamoto aside for now, I don’t believe Kei can answer this question. </p><p>I would like to think that this is something she learned while studying in the last few days, but… Me and Miyamoto were the only ones to answer correctly, and Kei answered incorrectly. </p><p>Still, this is the first time for her.</p><p>There is no need to panic yet, but she looked very anxious as she returned to her seat. </p><p>On the other hand, Miyamoto celebrated with Ike and the others and high-fived. </p><p>From what I heard during their conversation, it looks like Miyamoto learned about baseball rules from a game, and that this same game helped her out a few other times today. </p><p>You never know what kind of knowledge may come in handy.</p><p>That makes it 4 points. We temporarily passed the Sakayanagi Class and placed first. </p><p>Continuing on, turn 12.</p><p>The Sakayanagi Class easily scored 4 points after 4 students solved their problems correctly, but what surprised everyone the most was the Ryuen Class again. </p><p>The 5 names of the successful protections floated up on the screen like a replay. </p><p>In other words, they earned a perfect score again by protection slots alone. </p><p>“Come on, isn’t that way too much good luck?”</p><p>Ike shouted while holding his head, as he had already made up his mind that the Ryuen Class would remain in last place. </p><p>“...Are you sure we can just call it luck?”</p><p>Horikita’s voice sounded heavy as she looked at the monitor from the seat next to mine. </p><p>It’s no wonder. Getting a perfect score with protections two turns in a row is very unlikely. </p><p>If he gets another perfect score in the next turn… While the shock lingered, during the next attack targeting Ichinose, two students got protected and two answered correctly. </p><p>Next, it’s time for the Ichinose Class to attack.</p><hr /><p class="bold">Successful Protections:</p><p class="italic">Ishikura Kayoko, Sudou Ken <p class="bold">Attacker Targets:</p><p class="italic">Ayanokoji Kiyotaka, Matushita Chiaki, Karuizawa Kei </p><hr /><p>Me and Kei were targeted again for the second time in a row. </p><p>We stood up the moment we saw our names, and Kei spoke out while seeming a little upset. </p><p>“Are they targeting me!?”</p><p>“Calm down. Being named two times in a row doesn’t necessarily mean they’re focusing on you.” </p><p>Kei is right to be frantic.</p><p>If this is because they’re just targeting someone they deem to be weak, then that would be fine as it was. </p><p>However, the opponent is Ichinose. Kei should be able to guess that Ichinose might attack her because of personal feelings. </p><p>The issue is that including me in her targets makes this very evident, but… Whether her personal feelings are involved or not, we should rather see this as her trying to shake us up. </p><p>Still, it’s a solid move.</p><p>Horikita will not use a precious protection slot on me.</p><p>Perhaps a part of this is that Ichinose can also guess this.</p><p>Horikita might have protected Kei if it was a problem relating to academic studies, but the genre is News. </p><p>Horikita probably ignored Kei, as there’s plenty of chance of her solving the problem correctly. </p><p>On the other hand, I should be cautious here as I’ve answered incorrectly once already on the same genre during the first half. </p><hr /><p><label style="cursor: pointer; color: blue;" for="toggle2" class="italic">“What does it mean to ‘bubble’?” </label></p><input type="checkbox" id="toggle2" style="display: none;"><p class="note2" id="example-note2">TL Note - The word here is impossible to translate to English and still make sense as a question like this, it's a Japanese verb that means 'to drink bubble tea'. </p><hr /><p>I froze up when I saw the question.</p><p>What, uh, what is it? To bubble? Bubble. Bubble..?</p><p>The time ran out as I was frozen and it ended with me not writing anything down for an answer. </p><p>Most of the news questions that the other students received were related to politics or annual events. </p><p>So why did I get such a curve-ball of a question?</p><p>After that mysterious question, this time, I answered incorrectly and Kei answered correctly. </p><p>She seems to be relieved that she didn’t come within reach of elimination, so she should be calming down for a while. </p><p>Matsushita also easily gave the correct answer, and we secured 4 points. </p><p>On the other hand, as I answered two questions incorrectly, my name is now on the list of elimination candidates. </p><p>By the way, it seems the correct answer was ‘to drink bubble-tea’.</p><p>“I can’t believe it… You know even less about the world than I thought, huh?” </p><p>Horikita spoke to me with an astonished look on her face as I returned to my seat, and all I could do was hunch down. </p><p>Turn 13, the Horikita Class’s attack.</p><p>The genre is Kanji, difficulty 1. But then, unexpectedly, Horikita stopped talking. </p><p>She smoothly targeted 4 students, but seemed to be hesitating for the 5th name. </p><p>It must be very difficult to sort all the information in her head at this stage. </p><p>Who would be good at the genre, and who would be bad at it?</p><p>Perhaps she already used up all the information she had on Class-A.</p><p>There’s still some time left. Horikita breathed to calm herself down.</p><p>Then, a hand of salvation reached out to her.</p><p>“You should name Satonaka.”</p><p>A student muttered with disinterest.</p><img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 10/Images/image5.webp" alt=""><p>It’s someone who’s had a lot of free time on her hands as she was never targeted even once during the special test: Kushida. </p><p>“Thanks, Kushida-san. I’ll choose Satonaka for the 5th target then, sensei.” </p><p>She didn’t even ask for a reason, and showed complete trust in Kushida’s advice. </p><p>As a result, Satonaka was not protected, and also answered the question incorrectly. </p><p>“How did you find out that Satonaka wasn’t good with Kanji?”</p><p>Kushida clapped with admiration.</p><p>“What do you mean? You can learn of something like that very easily.”</p><p>Kushida said it was no big deal, and looked in a random direction with disinterest. </p><p>“You’ve been helping me out a lot. Thanks.”</p><p>“It’s no big deal.”</p><p>Kushida didn’t seem to be happy about receiving a compliment from Horikita. </p><p>However, seeing as her standing in the class isn’t very good right now, it’s not a bad thing for her to make a visible contribution like this. </p><p>Perhaps Kushida is one of the reasons Horikita is challenging the second half with such confidence. </p><p>Kushida Kikyou has an exceptional information network.</p><p>Not just because of her friends, but she is also actively looking to learn about everyone’s weaknesses. </p><p>That’s why she has an exceptionally good memory when it comes to the other students’ weak points. </p><p>She is only showing a part of that here, but I’m sure Horikita already received a lot of information from her beforehand. </p><p>It must be very reassuring for her.</p><p>Turn 13, Ichinose’s attack.</p><p>This is our third turn as defense, and Horikita chose to protect Karuizawa here. </p><p>It seems she is ignoring the possibility of protecting me despite the risk of elimination. </p><p>However, it seems she made a correct guess as Karuizawa’s name was displayed on the successful protections list. </p><p>I’d expect her to be glad she avoided the problem, but Kei clearly looks displeased. </p><p>“...They’re trying to eliminate me… It’s obvious they’re focusing on me, right!?” </p><p>“Yes, it does seem that way… a little.”</p><p>Sudou replied in agreement. However, assumptions will only lead to needless chaos. </p><p>“She’s not the type of person to try and drop a certain student.”</p><p>“That’s because..!”</p><p>Kei was about to argue back, but she stopped.</p><p>“At any rate, I don’t know what they’re trying to do, but I doubt you will be targeted again after successfully being protected.” </p><p>“...Mhm…”</p><p>“However, it’s a different story if she targets you 3 times in a row like how Koenji-kun was targeted during the first half. What is Ichinose-san thinking, I wonder?” </p><p>The next turn. Turn 14, Ichinose’s attack.</p><p>“...What should we do?”</p><p>Horikita seems to be hesitating on how to use the protection slots.</p><p>There’s no way Kei will be targeted a 4th time.</p><p>That’s how it should look, but perhaps Horikita should be wary of the possibility of Ichinose trying to undercut her. </p><p>“Why not protect her one more time just to see what happens? I think they’ll target her again.” </p><p>Kushida gave advice to Horikita while she was thinking.</p><p>“Is that what you think after seeing everything so far?”</p><p>“That’s not it. That’s what I think after seeing Ichinose-san so far.”</p><p>Kushida is taking into consideration not the events of the special test alone, but also Ichinose Honami’s way of thinking. </p><p>“You’re right, it might be the safest choice to protect her again here.” </p><p>Kei isn’t at risk yet, but Horikita wants to earn an easy point if they will target her again. </p><p>Then, the successful protections were displayed, and Kei’s name was on the list again. </p><p>She was targeted 4 times in a row, and passed Koenji’s record of being targeted 3 times in a row during this special test. </p><p>Despite some inexplicable points, she seems pleased that she is in a fierce competition against another class. </p><p>However, the situation started taking a turn for the worse.</p><p>Both the Horikita and the Sakayanagi classes are continuing to earn points with a good balance of attacks and protections, but the Ichinose Class is successfully protecting students at a very high rate after entering the second half. </p><p>However, the Ryuen Class is showing even more vigour than them.</p><p>Sakayanagi continued to choose eccentric genres in order to oppose Ryuen, but Ryuen still got 4 perfect protections in a row without a turnaround. </p><p>This is certainly an abnormality that cannot be explained by luck alone. </p><p>However, there is nothing else for Horikita to do in this situation.</p><p>All she can do is to stay calm and collected, and continue earning points. </p><p></p></div>
