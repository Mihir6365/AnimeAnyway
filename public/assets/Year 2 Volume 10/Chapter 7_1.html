Those inexplicable consecutive nominations were a lifeboat from Ichinose-san, in her own way.” </p><p>Ichinose nodded while apologizing and showed agreement to Horikita’s words. </p><p>“Huh? What is that supposed to mean..?” </p><p>“She was trying to give us points, in her own way. Isn’t that right?” </p><p>“I thought about contacting you with a chat app or a phone call, but I figured you’d find it strange if I told you I was going to give you points. So, I chose to consecutively nominate you instead to send the message in an easier way to understand. Then, Horikita-san noticed what I was doing and contacted me herself.” </p><p>Horikita contacted Ichinose, instead of the other way around. </p><p>This was an important point, which Ichinose made sure to explain. </p><p>“I was only able to protect all those students afterwards because Ichinose-san told me the names beforehand.” </p><p>“Why would she need to do something like that..?” </p><p>“In order to defeat Class-A, right? We turned this into a fight where classes below rank 2 would not lose.” </p><p>“Yes. We had no choice but to fight Sakayanagi-san head-to-head from the start. That’s why I called it a lifeboat.” </p><p>The 6 point difference might have quickly turned around if not for Ichinose’s help. </p><p>“B-But why me?” </p><p>“You’re at the center of the girls, so isn’t it obvious Horikita-san would want to protect you from being eliminated? That’s why I always intended on continuing to name you. But when I realized it must have made you feel uneasy, I rushed over here right away. I’m really sorry!” </p><p>Kei calmed down for the moment after Horikita showed her a message to support Ichinose’s explanation. </p><p>Ichinose apologized to Kei a few times again, and left after saying her classmates were waiting for her. </p><p>After that, the students thanked Horikita while she was looking at the rankings and started leaving. </p><p>I’m also going to talk to her. </p><p>“We lost this time. I’m sure that there was some kind of deal between Ryuen-kun and Ichinose-san during the second half… I have no proof of course, so this is nothing but conjecture. He gave Ichinose-san the points she needed to take 2nd place and avoid any eliminations.” </p><p>“Yeah. But that’s not the important part.” </p><p>Horikita nodded and stood up. </p><p>“If two classes joined hands together, then they fundamentally had to have started from the first half. That’s when they can first assist each other and share their victory. That’s why I was relieved by the end of the first half when there wasn’t any signs of something like that happening.” </p><p>“You’re not alone in that. Even Sakayanagi couldn't predict this.” </p><p>It’s not certain at what stage Sakayanagi and Ichinose joined hands, but it has to be after the special test was announced. </p><p>After that, they remained hidden underwater while quietly moving ahead with their preparations. </p><p>“But the starting point of it all was when Ryuen knew all of Sakayanagi’s targets beforehand.” </p><p>“Someone leaked information to him from Class-A… That’s the only way to explain it.” </p><p>“That’s right.” </p><p>“They must be really off-the-rails student. I can’t even imagine so concretely betraying my own class. On top of that, it isn’t Class-D or Class-C we’re talking about here. It’s Class-A, where the student stayed ever since enrollment. Just what kind of compensation would be worth doing something like this?” </p><p>“I’ll give you 20,000,000 points to betray your class. It has to be something like that.” </p><p>No, it’s still doubtful that this would be enough for anyone to betray their class. </p><p>Getting 20,000,000 points, which allows one to freely move classes is an important goal, but there’s still over a year left until graduation. </p><p>Any betrayal would soon come out in the open with such a massive transfer of points, and the betrayer would be begrudged by the entirety of Class-A. </p><p>The betrayer will also be envied by students from the other classes. </p><p>If they are targeted in the next special tests and face expulsion, they will have to spend their private points instead of getting to keep them. </p><p>That would be a complete disaster. </p><p>In other words, I can say that the betrayer was looking for something special that is out of the ordinary. </p><p>“I definitely don’t like this development, but I can’t complain. It’s a shame that we couldn’t get first place, but we finished without suffering much damage thanks to Class-A taking last place. But it’s still frustrating.” </p><p>Horikita frankly spoke her feelings after we entered the corridor and went away from the other students’ eyes. </p><p>“You can just bring that frustration to the next special test.” </p><p>“You’re right… That’s what I’m going to do.” </p><p>“I’m going to check on the Ryuen Class. What are you going to do?” </p><p>“...I’m leaving for now. I’m not confident that I can stand his provocations right now.” </p><p>Indeed, I can’t deny the possibility of an excited Ryuen trying to instigate her. </p><p></p></div>
