    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
The students who didn't have their lunches with them hurriedly rushed to markets and convenience stores. 

</p><p>Then, they returned to the classroom. 

</p><p>About 10 minutes after lunch break started, all 37 students, excluding Koenji, gathered in the classroom. In order to discuss the upcoming Special Test, of course. 

</p><p>The idea was to make the most of this time by discussing and eating at the same time.

</p><p>There are a few important topics, but one of them is to come to a thorough understanding of the Special Test, as Horikita said. 

</p><p>Then, there’s the leader election. 

</p><p>I can guess that there will be few who would oppose Horikita if she nominated herself, as she has been acting as a real leader for the class so far, but she’s not saying anything about that yet as the discussions have just started.

</p><p>She’s certainly not the type to avoid responsibilities, but she probably wants to hear the class’s opinions first. 

</p><p>It’s not a certain thing that there won’t be any other students nominating themselves. 

</p><p>However, even if Horikita doesn’t raise her hand, there will be those who push for her to become the leader.

</p><p>“Horikita-san. I want to ask one thing before we get too deep into this discussion. Will you accept if we ask you to take on the leader’s role in this Special Test?”

</p><p>Yousuke took the initiative to ask what all his classmates wanted to ask. 

</p><p>He’s probably doing this for the class, trying to quickly make Horikita, who could probably get a result of at least 70 to 80 points, the leader instead of someone unexpected.

</p><p>However, he could also have a completely different motive.

</p><p>Because he still has strong negative feelings towards Horikita, who changed the class policy during the Unanimous Special Test and caused disorder. 

</p><p>Of course, he doesn’t make any of this felt, though.

</p><p>“I won’t refuse if numerous people point at me. However, according to the rules of this Special Test, the leader takes on a massive responsibility and, at the same time, avoids the risk of being eliminated or expelled. I think I’d like to hear the others out if there is anyone who wants to nominate themself.” 

</p><p>On the other hand, Horikita isn’t rushing for a conclusion. 

</p><p>She’s being very prudent with her decisions, precisely because she understands the contents of the Special Test. 

</p><p>The leader will have the responsibility of coming up with a strategy and instructing others, but they will also have the privilege of avoiding expulsion. 

</p><p>There is nobody among the 37 students here who would want to be expelled.

</p><p>In which case, there could be those who want the expulsion avoidance and try to show themselves to be more capable than Horikita. 

</p><p>However, most would not do that. 

</p><p>This is just an if.

</p><p>The reality is that everybody will want to elect a safe leader. 

</p><p>If they do nominate themselves just for the sake of self-protection, their classmates will naturally not accept this. 

</p><p>In the end, what will be required of the leader is responsibility, and the resolve and confidence to make the class win.

</p><p>“Does anyone here want to become the leader? If so, would they like to tell us?”

</p><p>Horikita asked while looking around the class after moving over to the teacher’s desk.

</p><p>The classroom immediately became quiet as the students simply looked at each other.

</p><p>After waiting for a nominee for around 30 seconds, Yousuke nodded. 

</p><p>“Correct answer. I don’t think the leader’s privilege of avoiding expulsion is that great of a blessing. If there are no other students who would take on the heavy responsibility for the class, I’d certainly want to leave it to Horikita. How about it?”

</p><p>Yousuke quickly tried to reach a decision, showing that there were no other candidates.

</p><p>His urgency is certainly something to make note of, but the election of a leader is very important.

</p><p>Horikita waited for a reply for a while, and she reacted a little late, perhaps because she was looking at her phone screen.

</p><p>She was still listening, though, and she started speaking after closing the screen.

</p><p>“Yes, I’ll accept, of course. I showed some restraint in order to hear the others’ opinions, but I was always intending on taking on the leader role. If there are no objections, then—”

</p><p>“Wait a bit.”

</p><p>It’s going to be Horikita. 

</p><p>That was the thought in everyone’s minds, but Maezono unhesitatingly raised her arm.

</p><p>“I think that, err, maybe there is a little room for argument here.”

</p><p>Yousuke’s expression stiffened for just a moment, but he didn’t break his smile.

</p><p>He usually doesn’t show gaps like this, so this is unlike him. I suppose he’s wary in the face of a Special Test that brings the risk of expulsion with it.

</p><p>“I do think that Horikita-san would be reliable. It’s also great to have a leader who is fine with taking on a heavy responsibility. But… We can’t lose this Special Test no matter what, right? If we get last place and there are eliminations, there’s going to be expulsions in our class. That’s precisely why we have to choose the leader with the biggest chance of bringing us victory, isn’t it?”

</p><p>Yousuke would immediately oppose it if she looked like she just wanted to become the leader for her own safety, but she’s instead putting Horikita’s ability into question.

</p><p>“Indeed, Maezono is right in saying that picking the leader with the greatest chance of winning is the best choice. So, don’t you think Horikita-san is good enough to make the right decisions for a victory?” 

</p><p>Seemingly trusting Horikita the most with the responsibility, Yousuke quickly gave his reply.

</p><p>“I’m not doubting Horikita-san’s abilities. I just think there’s room to argue if she’s still the best choice. Isn’t there anyone else in this class who can make correct decisions?” 

</p><p>She’s not pointing at anyone in particular, and instead asking the class, including Yousuke.

</p><p>Yousuke nodded a few times without breaking his smile, but he started sounding a little choked up while replying.

</p><p>Because while Maezono’s question isn’t that strange, it was troublesome.

</p><p>Yousuke doesn’t want to mishandle things and create an awkward atmosphere.

</p><p>Then, Ike spoke up, not having thought that deeply about Maezono’s surprising reaction.

</p><p>“Do you have anyone in mind, then? Because I don’t.”

</p><p>“Calm down. This is just my personal opinion, but can I say something?”

</p><p>Speaking up to Yousuke, it seems Maezono has someone in mind.

</p><p>Nobody has the right to stop her from speaking, so Maezono continued.

</p><p>“Horikita-san changed her opinion when things were going towards Kushida-san’s expulsion back during the Unanimous Special Test, right? I just couldn't help but wonder why she didn’t stick to the plan when she was supposed to. The leader’s going to make all the decisions this time, right? We can’t ignore that the leader will decide who among the eliminations will be expelled. Oh, just let me say that I don’t think she made the wrong decision, though. It didn’t solve all the problems, but Kushida-san remaining in the class was a big plus for us.”

</p><p>She politely made sure to note that it isn’t as if she pointlessly hates Kushida.

</p><p>Of course, I’m sure Kushida was annoyed just by the fact that her name was said.

</p><p>Still, there is room to wonder if that smile is a warm one or not…

Maezono is not saying that she doubts Horikita’s excellence, but she’s questioning whether her abilities are worth trusting Horikita.

</p><p>“The part about the leader’s skill to make decisions is important. Leaving aside the question of if there is anyone else fit for the job, I’m just asking if Horikita-san is the best person to leave this Special Test in the hands of.” 

</p><p>She again emphasized that she just wants to think with the class and make sure she is the right choice.

</p><p>As things are, if I am asked whether Horikita’s skills to make the right decisions are flawless, it’s a no.

</p><p>So I think this should be a welcomed question. 

</p><p>This discussion is important for Horikita also. 

</p><p>This will be an opportunity to grow and get some opinions from those around her.

</p><p>However, I’m surprised to see someone like Maezono so openly questioning Horikita’s abilities.

</p><p>“I see… What you’re saying is painfully true. It’s true that I was lost at that time. Then, I ignored the opinion of many of my classmates and changed things purely based on my own opinion. This is all true.” 

</p><p>Hasabe’s face trembled a little as she had an intense expression, but she didn’t do anything like glare at Horikita. 

</p><p>I’m sure she now understands Horikita was in a very difficult situation too back then. 

</p><p>“I am unskilled in many aspects. I also can’t declare with certainty that I’m the best choice. However, nobody else is currently nominating themselves to be the leader.”

</p><p>“Then we can nominate one ourselves. If we ask the others, maybe we’ll find a more suitable candidate. It’s worth asking, isn’t it?”

</p><p>“I see, nominate. Indeed, I’m sure there are those in the class who think it’s better if the leader is someone other than me. However, I did ask the class once. I told you all to raise your hand if someone wants to be the leader. Is this a good decision to leave in the hands of those who won’t nominate themselves?”

</p><p>“Well…”

</p><p>“Or perhaps we should ask the only person who didn’t participate in this discussion, Koenji-kun? He’s sharp and able in his own way, and I think he’d also make the right decisions.”

</p><p>Horikita replied, decisively dealing with Maezono’s opinion. 

</p><p>Indeed, I’m sure she believes Koenji as someone capable of immediately answering any question.

</p><p>Mezono looked annoyed for a second, she stayed quiet.

</p><p>“You have the right idea. I agree with you in that we must look for someone who can make stronger, more agile and better decisions. So let me ask the class after what you said. I want someone with the confidence to lead our class to victory in this Special Test to raise their hand. I will gladly give up the leader position if there is someone I deem to be a better choice than me.” 

</p><p>It’s obvious I’m the person she’s trying to hint towards, and a few people did look at me, but I showed no reaction, of course.

</p><p>Because I’m not going to steal Horikita’s opportunity to grow and gain experience.

</p><p>Horikita also knows better than anyone that I will not nominate myself.

</p><p>So she’s trying to get it over while making it look like she’s looking for someone with decisive power in the class.

</p><p>Hidden talent alone isn't good enough to win a fight.

</p><p>This Special Test can’t be left in the hands of someone who doesn’t raise their own hand.

</p><p>“Horikita-san is right. We can’t make someone the leader if they aren’t nominating themself, can we?”

</p><p>Maezono’s remark turned out to be a needless one after the situation resolved itself with her going back on her own opinion, but she isn’t being criticized. 

</p><p>It’s important to put an end to the bias among the students that Horikita should always be the leader.

</p><p>Is Horikita the best choice for a leader in this situation, or not? 

</p><p>I don’t think there’s any need to worry about that, as she reaches the answer while confirming that each time. 

</p><p>The time she completely erased any doubt of this is the time she became a leader of the class accepted by everyone. 

</p><p>“Looks like we can finally move forward. Let’s continue talking about the Special Test. You can also continue eating, as I’ve noticed your hands have stopped.”

</p><p>Most students had completely stopped eating because of the stressful atmosphere. Some also frantically shoveled food into their mouths after hearing Yousuke’s remark instead.

</p><p>After that, Horikita started explaining the Special Test’s contents and rules again while centering the explanation around Yousuke.

</p><p>Yousuke ate when Horikita talked, and Horikita ate when Yousuke talked.

</p><p>Including the things we couldn’t ask during Chabashira-sensei’s explanation, when we entered the latter part of the lunch break, all students had come to a deeper understanding of the Special Test.

</p><p>Then, when they started exchanging opinions, Sudou started firmly speaking as if he had been waiting for his chance. 

</p><p>“He’s not even here right now, but what are we going to do about Koenji? Are we going to protect him? That’s the promise, right?”

</p><p>Calling it an advance payment until graduation, Koenji individually earned first place in the Uninhabited Island Special Test. 

</p><p>In exchange, he earned the privilege of complete freedom. 

</p><p>This means that Koenji is under unconditional protection. 

</p><p>Naturally, Koenji would also be under risk of elimination and expulsion during this Special Test.

</p><p>This is the contract made just before the Uninhabited Island Special Test, and this is known to everyone in the class as it was already explained by Horikita after the Special Test.

</p><p>“That’s a timely topic. I just got a nice e-mail from him. ‘I shouldn’t even have to tell you this, but you guys are gonna have to protect me from expulsion, okay?’” 

</p><p>She turned the screen to her classmates and showed them the message.

</p><p>“This is the worst! That means our protections are forced to go down to 4!”

</p><p>If the other side notices that we are constantly protecting Koenji, they will naturally avoid naming him. 

</p><p>However, there is no guarantee he will not be attacked, so the class has to protect its contract with him.

</p><p>“Don’t jump to a hasty conclusion. We can’t say for certain that it’s necessary to constantly protect him. I’ll think about a countermeasure. I won’t talk about the details now, but there’s no need to feel anxious.” 

</p><p>The class can’t have a simple talk about its strategy right now.

</p><p>Contrarian opinions will take up time, and there isn’t enough of it during this lunch break. 

</p><p>Horikita, considering the remaining time, emphasized the important topics and only accepted questions relating to them.

</p><p>Horikita also noted that any discussions that could relate to strategies should be done carefully with information leakage in mind, and that ideas which came up would be listened to, but she forbade discussing strategy in this crowded classroom with people passing by the corridor and where she can easily be recorded.
