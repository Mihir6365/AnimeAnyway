I’m just thinking about something that drew my attention during the test.”</p><p>I didn’t expect her to bring that up again right away“I’m kidding. I wasn’t expecting you to ask to talk to me, though. Do you want advice?”</p><p>“No, it’s nothing like that, but did you notice the order in which the names were displayed while the attacker named their targets?”</p><p>“Was there an order to it..? I didn’t pay much attention to that, to be honest.</p><p>They weren’t ordered alphabetically or by gender, were they?”</p><p>“I’d have to ask the attacking side from other classes to make sure, but there was no rule by which you chose the names. In other words, the names were exactly in the order announced by the leader.”</p><p>“I see, you may be right about that. So?”</p><p>“What drew my attention are Sakayanagi’s namings on the 2nd and 4th turns during the first half. She kept targeting Koenji and continued for 3 turns after that, and he was the first name every time.”</p><p>“So you’re saying she decided on targeting Koenji-kun until turn 2, and that she continued targeting him after that as well when he correctly..? Yukimura-kun also got it wrong on that turn 2, didn’t he?” </p><p>“That’s right. Koenji is also a threat if you look at his innate talent, but Keisei is definitely a bigger obstacle based on overall ability. However, Sakayanagi didn’t even name Keisei on turn 3 either.” </p><p>“I figured she just made the wrong guess back then, you know? Maybe she had to decide I would protect Yukimura-kun because I think he’s important, right?”</p><p>“True, maybe she missed the attack target because of that thought in relation to Keisei. However, that doesn’t explain Koenji. Even after he gave the correct answer on turn 4 despite getting it wrong back to back on turn 2 and turn 3, she didn’t show his name after turn 5 even once during the first half. I’d understand if he was being guaranteed under protection, but he solved the problem himself on turn 4. In other words, she should have noticed that we haven’t protected him even once.”</p><p>“Sakayanagi-san targeted Koenji alone early on. After putting him in reach of elimination after two asssignments, she then stopped her attacks after he gave just one correct answer. That’s the weird thing, isn’t it?” </p><p>It’s best to cause as many eliminations as you can. </p><p>She should have attacked Koenji when there was very little chance for him to be protected.</p><p>“Maybe she was wary of the volume of his knowledge?”</p><p>“Then there would be no need for her to purposefully target Koenji at the start. That contradicts with her naming him 3 times in a row.” </p><p>“...So Sakayanagi-san knows about the contents of the contract between me and Koenji-kun?”</p><p>“That’s the most obvious conclusion. While we have the contract, Koenji doesn’t take anything seriously. Besides, she should have also considered that you wouldn’t protect him until he fails 2 times.” </p><p>Of course, the possibility of Koenji answering correctly or Horikita protecting him from the start was never 0, but in that case, she should have quickly given up on targeting Koenji after turn 3.</p><p>“But why didn’t she target him again after turn 5? I made the choice not to protect him, right?”</p><p>“That’s precisely because you made that choice. After missing the target because of Koenji while trying to cancel a protection, she didn’t see any point in trying to eliminate Koenji. In fact, she should have thought of it as a loss for her.” </p><p>“Even though we’d lose 1 more point if he was eliminated?” </p><p>“That’s right. You said it yourself before the test. You said that you had a way to make the wound as shallow as possible in case we drop down to last rank. That was going to be by expelling Koenji, wasn’t it?” </p><p>“...She knew.”</p><p>“That your contract with Koenji is to not expel him. That to let him be ‘free’. You didn’t force Koenji to do anything in this Special Test, so on paper you’re protecting the ‘freedom’ promise. Then, the protection from expulsion. Even if this ends with Koenji as the only elimination, it can be solved by using a protection point.” </p><p>Since his victory at the Uninhabited Island Special Test, Koenji has a protection point in his hands. In other words, he has the privilege to cancel an expulsion.</p><p>“That’s right. I never promised I’d protect Koenji’s protection point. As long as he isn’t expelled, our contract will be fulfilled. He has no right to begrudge me.”</p><p>Even if she loses 1 point because of the elimination, even if someone else is eliminated afterwards, it would turn out fine just by stripping Koenji of his protection point. </p><p>In other words, that would mean there is no risk of someone being expelled even if the class ends up in last rank. </p><p>“I bet I made everyone in class feel uneasy since I didn’t protect him, though.”</p><p>“Koenji would see what you’re trying to do if you explained it to the class.” </p><p>“Yes. Well, I think he already noticed it from the fact that I didn’t protect him. Things would be a lot better for me in the second half if I could have dropped him at an early stage.” </p><p>That’s why Koenji solved the problem correctly himself.</p><p>Because he doesn’t like the idea of his protection point being used up.</p><p>“Based on Sakayanagi’s character, it’s reasonable to think that Sakayanagi didn’t want the ‘pressure of someone being eliminated’ to go away.”</p><p>“We can clearly see her character in all of her moves. But why didn’t Koenji go for a correct answer right from the 1st problem, though?”</p><p>“I know the answer to that one. I think he figured even starting from the 3rd time wouldn’t be too late. At any rate, what I wanted to say is that there might be a student leaking information outside of the class.” </p><p>This is something that relates not just to this test, but the ones in the future as well.</p><p>“Thanks. I think we should pay attention to that, particularly from now on.”</p><p>“Our talk is over. By the way, what will you do for lunch?”</p><p>“I didn’t have any time to make a lunch box, so I might take this opportunity to go to the cafeteria. What about you?”</p><p>“I’ll do that too, then. Kei’s probably somewhere staring at her phone anyway.”</p><p>After I replied while looking at the classroom’s direction, Horikita nodded.</p><p>Kei is still unhurt since she was not targeted even once during the first half.</p><p>Of course, I can’t say this makes her safe as she’d be eliminated in 3 questions at most.</p><p>She’s probably trying to force some more knowledge into her head in order to avoid that.</p><p></p></div>
