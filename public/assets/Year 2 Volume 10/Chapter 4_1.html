    <h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>
We didn't exchange many words on our way, and before long, we reached the designated cafe. 

</p><p>Since it was a weekday, the cafe was relatively empty, allowing us to choose our seats freely. 

</p><p>After inquiring about Horikita's drink preference, I gestured towards a seat by the window and let her sit first. 

</p><p>I silently queued behind two individuals already waiting at the counter. 

</p><p>Horikita, settled in her seat, glanced at me with a hint of restlessness. 

</p><p>She was likely uncertain about the topic of our impending conversation.

</p><p>How to broach the subject— strategy, thought process, priorities, and secondary considerations. 

</p><p>I wasn't keen on delving into the details, instead, I preferred to entrust these matters to Horikita, the leader.

</p><p>So, why did I arrange this private moment with Horikita? 

</p><p>It was to impart new strength to her, a responsibility I had decided to bestow upon her as the special exam drew nearer. 

</p><p>Now was the perfect moment, as her mind continued to grow and mature. 

</p><p>With a deep understanding of herself, the class, and having formed a friendship, she was ready for the next phase.

</p><p>When my turn arrived, I ordered two blended coffees and waited by the counter for them to be prepared. 

</p><p>After approximately two minutes, as the extraction seemed to be complete, two cups of coffee were brought over. 

</p><p>I grabbed the handles and made my way back to where Horikita was patiently waiting.

</p><p>“Thank you. About the money—”

</p><p>“Don't worry about it. You covered the karaoke, and you treated me to lunch the other day.”

</p><p>“In that case, I'll gladly accept your offer.”

</p><p>We both slowly enjoyed the hot, flavorful coffee. 

</p><p>As I observed Horikita exhale, I noticed the fatigue etched on her face. 

</p><p>It seemed she was constantly engaged in mental activity, whether it was a weekday or a holiday.

</p><p>“...Is there something on my face?” 

</p><p>She seemed displeased with my prolonged gaze and shot me a glare.

</p><p>“No, I was just reflecting. Your hair has grown quite long, hasn't it?”

</p><p>Even as a diversion, it proved effective, particularly if the person was concerned about their appearance. 

</p><p>Horikita ran her fingers through her hair and let her gaze wander.

</p><p>“It's been almost a year since I last cut it short. Time flies, doesn't it?”

</p><p>“You were in tears at the time.”

</p><p>“What if there was a tragic accident here, and I accidentally spilled hot coffee on your shirt?”

</p><p>“I'd definitely get burned, and it would definitely be intentional, not an accident.”

</p><p>“You'd dodge it if I tried to splash the coffee on you, right?”

</p><p>Horikita had witnessed a similar incident at karaoke with Ryuen when I narrowly avoided being splashed with orange juice by surprise. 

</p><p>If she wanted to ensure a direct hit, grabbing me would be the right move, but spilling coffee would result in far worse damage than orange juice.

</p><p>“Why are you trying to move? I wouldn't cause such trouble for the cafe.”

</p><p>“Please prioritize avoiding major burns to your classmate instead.”

</p><p>“You're really... peculiar, aren't you?”

</p><p>“Which part of this conversation makes me the peculiar one? You're the one who's peculiar.”

</p><p>In truth, I often found myself at the mercy of Horikita's peculiar behaviour.

</p><p>“I'm not peculiar. I just... sometimes my seriousness is misplaced.”

</p><p>Depending on how you looked at it, one could argue she in fact was peculiar, but I would never say it out loud.

</p><p>“So? This isn't what you wanted to discuss, right? We were supposed to talk about the special exam…”

</p><p>Indeed, it was time to delve into the main topic.

</p><p>“There's no need to be overly cautious about our surroundings right now, but we shouldn't casually reveal the details of our strategy either. What I'm interested in is slightly different. I want to understand your mindset going into this special exam.”

</p><p>“Um, I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'mindset.'”

</p><p>“I mean your approach to winning the exam. The level of determination you have and the willingness to make tough decisions. Those are things you can share with anyone, like you do with Yosuke and the others every day, and occasionally with the group led by Ike. But what I want to discuss here is something that can only be done between you and me, at least for now. This special exam is fraught with the issue of expulsions. Looking back, you can see it clearly, but I want you to reflect on the changes happening within you now compared to during the unanimous voting exam.”

</p><p>By referencing specific instances from the past, Horikita grasped the essence of what I meant by 'mindset.'

</p><p>“It seems like you're not mistaken when you say this is a conversation only we can have…”

</p><p>The act of revealing one's innermost thoughts. 

</p><p>While relying on companions was crucial, it wasn't easy for the leader to show vulnerability.

</p><p>“Should I assume that you'll correct me if you think my mindset is off?”

</p><p>“Whether I can provide appropriate advice or not is another matter, but I do intend to share my personal perspective.”

</p><p>Upon hearing this, Horikita straightened her posture and met my gaze. 

</p><p>I anticipated her to start speaking, but she instead narrowed her eyes and placed a hand over her mouth.

</p><p>“That's suspicious.” 

</p><p>She blurted out, appearing flustered as if she hadn't meant to vocalize her thoughts.

</p><p>“I'm sorry. That was rather straightforward of me, wasn't it?”

</p><p>“Am I really that suspicious?”

</p><p>“Well, you being concerned about me is, um, sort of unsettling, don't you think?”

</p><p>“I understand your perspective, but 'unsettling' might be a bit too extreme.”

</p><p>“Yeah, you're right. Um, let me gather my thoughts.”

</p><p>With that, she composed herself once more.

</p><p>“I want to ask you directly. Have you decided what to do if we end up in last place in this special exam?”

</p><p>She didn't want to expel anyone. 

</p><p>But she knew she'd have to make that choice. 

</p><p>While the circumstances were different, it mirrored the decision she had to make during the unanimous voting exam.

</p><p>“Answering that question right away is quite a challenge, isn't it?”

</p><p>“Absolutely.”

</p><p>“Since that day, I've been wrestling with it constantly. There are moments when I feel a pang of guilt and regret, despite firmly believing I made the right decision. It's a rather sobering thought.” 

</p><p>She admitted, her gaze drifting downwards.

</p><p>“I can't predict the future with certainty. Every member of the class is gradually evolving, day by day. Even if we were to rank them based on their abilities, those rankings would likely fluctuate.”

</p><p>I couldn't argue with her on that point. 

</p><p>Some days, Ike would be at the bottom, while on other days, it might be Hondo. 

</p><p>Given our collective efforts to avoid being at the bottom, it's only natural that we can't decide who to expel in the future.

</p><p>“But the upcoming special exam presents a different challenge. I'm approaching it with two options in mind in case we find ourselves at the bottom. One option is less painful, while the other is more bitter. However, given the various obstacles, there's no guarantee that the less painful option can be realized…”

</p><p>Her contemplation on the matter was evident.

</p><p>“If we end up in last place, we can't simply avoid choosing someone to expel. There's no fairy tale ending where we lose without anyone bearing the consequences. With the limited Private Points we have, the reality is that we're faced with two choices.”

</p><p>The latter, more bitter choice would involve reluctantly expelling someone. 

</p><p>As a leader, it's her responsibility to make that decision, even if it's one she'd rather avoid.

</p><p>“Regardless of the outcome, I've established my own criteria to make a decision without hesitation.”

</p><p>There was no need for pretense in this scenario. 

</p><p>If she were bluffing, it would reveal much about her character. 

</p><p>Observing Horikita's sincere and straightforward gaze, it was evident that she was prepared to make a decision, regardless of the choice she faced.

</p><p>“I see. It appears you won't be at a loss if we end up in last place.”

</p><p>“Perhaps I shouldn't entertain the thought of losing from the start, but given the risk of expulsion, I can't help but contemplate the decision in advance. It may seem shameful, and you might laugh at it…”

</p><p>“What's there to laugh about?”

</p><p>“True... but... typically, you don't anticipate losing from the outset…”

</p><p>“If your ultimate goal is victory, regardless of whether you finish first or last, there's no fault in it. You've considered the implications of finishing last because you care about the class. That's all there is to it.”

</p><p>“...Thank you…”

</p><p>There was no need for gratitude, yet she found herself in a position to heed my counsel. 

</p><p>Perhaps that was why Horikita remained direct.

</p><p>“I'm relieved my concerns were unfounded. If something goes awry, I trust I can rely on you.”

</p><p>“You assisted me during the unanimous voting exam. Ah, is that all you wanted to discuss?”

</p><p>Unfortunately, the answer was no.

</p><p>“No, we're just scratching the surface of the main topic.”

</p><p>“Is that so... Then, what is it? If it's not about devising a winning strategy, are you inquiring about the aftermath of winning? No, that can't be…”

</p><p>“Winning this exam entails defeating other classes. And with victory comes the creation of a class at the bottom. There's a high likelihood that someone will face expulsion.”

</p><p>“I suppose so.”

</p><p>“But the identity of that 'someone' isn't for you to determine. It's self-evident, but you grasp what I'm implying, correct?”

</p><p>“Of course, each class leader will contemplate and decide.”

</p><p>“You learned how to cope with a dismissal from your own class following your past failure. But if I hadn’t intervened, we wouldn’t know the current state of the class.”

</p><p>“As humiliating as it sounds, that's the reality. It wouldn't be surprising if the class had disintegrated.”

</p><p>“Learning from mistakes is crucial, but continual failure isn't sustainable. There's no safety net guaranteed. Ultimately, consistently making the right decisions from the outset and steadily progressing is a true testament to one's abilities.”

</p><p>With a slightly cooled cup in hand, Horikita quietly savoured her coffee.

</p><p>“I couldn't agree more.”

</p><p>“Let's delve into specifics. There will inevitably come a time when we directly confront another class. In that scenario, your class will have three potential outcomes. One where we emerge victorious, another where we suffer defeat, and a third where neither victory nor defeat is achieved, but rather a draw. Which future do you prefer?”

</p><p>“There's no doubt about it. I want my class to emerge victorious; there's no alternative.”

</p><p>“Then, let's introduce a new condition to this future. Your class emerges victorious, but as a consequence, the defeated class faces expulsion. How would you decide in this scenario?”

</p><p>“I'm sorry, but we prioritize our victory. That's the correct decision, isn't it?”

</p><p>“So you would still prioritize your class's victory.”

</p><p>With my probing questions, Horikita's lips tightened slightly.

</p><p>“Is it wrong to prioritize winning, much like in this special exam?”

</p><p>“No one implied it was an error. Let's introduce one final condition. The specific class in question is Ryuen's class, and the individual expelled is Ibuki Mio. In this scenario, which of the three futures would you opt for?”

</p><p>Caught off guard by this unexpected scenario, Horikita momentarily froze after offering a series of instinctive responses.

</p><p>“...Ibuki-san?”

</p><p>“What's the issue? Which of the three options do you select? Victory, defeat, or a draw?”

</p><p>“Wait a moment. Ibuki-san has a close relationship with Ryuen-kun. It's hard to imagine she would be the primary candidate for expulsion. Is this hypothesis even plausible?”

</p><p>“Plausible? Your choice of words is curious. A hypothesis remains just that—a hypothesis.”

</p><p>“But—”

</p><p>“Ibuki's position and safety aren't assured. Given her OAA assessment, she's deemed expendable. Considering Ryuen's disposition, such a scenario is conceivable. Moreover, there's no certainty that Ryuen can designate the individual to be expelled. Unforeseeable mishaps could occur.”

</p><p>Presented with this assertive explanation, Horikita reluctantly spoke up.

</p><p>“...For the sake of our class's victory, it's only natural to prioritize winning, even if it means Ibuki-san is the one to be expelled.”

</p><p>“You're hesitating to respond immediately. It's evident you're reluctant to entertain a scenario where you're forced to choose.”

</p><p>“What exactly are you implying?”

</p><p>“I may not know your interpersonal dynamics, but it's evident that among the students from other classes, Ibuki holds a closer connection to you than most. And it's not solely about the degree of 'closeness' or 'distance.'”

</p><p>“If you're also considering relationships characterized by 'not close,' then yes, I won't refute that.”

</p><p>Maintaining eye contact, she endeavoured to convey an attitude of indifference. 

</p><p>Despite claiming not to refute it, the reality was, she couldn't. 

</p><p>Even if the individual involved remained oblivious, it was a reflexive response stemming from primal instincts. 

</p><p>Refusal to acknowledge it served as evidence that she recognized the inconvenience of doing so. 

</p><p>While visual cues might facilitate deception, auditory information demanded a higher level of finesse. 

</p><p>The more one attempted to control their behaviour, the more susceptible they became to verbal slips.

</p><p>“But in this special exam, the rule is different on how a student can be expelled. Thus, for the first time, a student we hadn't anticipated might face expulsion.”

</p><p>“You're suggesting that even Ibuki-san isn't exempt from this.”

</p><p>“If Ryuen were to designate Ibuki as a potential candidate for expulsion, and it became evident that he was likely intending to expel her if she were eliminated, would you still be willing to take a course of action that results in Ibuki's expulsion in order to secure victory?”

</p><p>Until now, Horikita had vehemently pursued victory, despite her inner turmoil. 

</p><p>However, her once unwavering resolve had been shattered for the first time. 

</p><p>The mere thought of indirectly causing Ibuki's departure by her own hand...

</p><p>If this were a year prior, Horikita might have executed such a decision without much hesitation. 

</p><p>However, circumstances had changed.

</p><p>She had grown acquainted with Ibuki, delving deep into her character and identity. 

</p><p>Despite their adversarial positions, Ibuki had undeniably transitioned into a friend.

</p><p>“Why... pose such a question?” 

</p><p>She countered, deflecting the query with a forceful return.

</p><p>“In this special exam, it presents an opportunity to eliminate students deemed undesirable, but it also serves as the battleground for the expulsion of those perceived as expendable. When you recognize the potential strategic advantage gained by targeting Ibuki, are you capable of leading decisively as a leader? That's what I aim to ascertain. I believed initiating this discussion now would prove beneficial.” 

</p><p>Attempting to address it on the day of the exam, amidst the pressure and time constraints, would undoubtedly prove challenging.

</p><p>“So, you’re suggesting... I should mentally prepare for the possibility of losing someone like Ibuki-san, or someone in a similar situation?”

</p><p>“No, my intent is to emphasize awareness. Your focus primarily lies on your own class, leaving you with a limited understanding of the other classes. Your considerations may have been cursory, thinking, ‘I wish to eliminate this individual, but I don't want that other person to face expulsion.’ Have you approached this special exam with a clear comprehension of what lies ahead?”

</p><p>“Well... no, I haven’t. My focus has been primarily on minimizing potential losses in case of defeat, identifying potential candidates for expulsion from our own side in an emergency, and strategizing for the class’s victory.” 

</p><p>Admitted Horikita, conceding the point with a sense of resignation. 

</p><p>She likely hadn’t given thorough consideration to whom she might have to face off against. 

</p><p>Even if she had contemplated it, the prospect of targeting someone directly would pose challenges. 

</p><p>As the leader, her inclination would naturally be to retain the most capable students, given the likelihood of multiple eliminations. 

</p><p>Consequently, she hadn’t dwelled on the matter further.

</p><p>“If you stop at that point, you’ll struggle to adapt to changing circumstances,” I remarked.

</p><p>“So, what should I do to address this issue?” she inquired.

</p><p>“As I mentioned, simply being aware of it is crucial. Everyone has their own approach to battle. Ryuen adopts a ruthless stance toward his enemies, targeting their most skilled individuals. Sakayanagi tends to focus on individuals she dislikes, irrespective of their strength or weakness. Totsuka serves as a prime example. Conversely, Ichinose doesn’t prioritize expulsion of the opposing party. Each person possesses distinct tendencies, strengths, and weaknesses.”

</p><p>“But I’m uncertain about which approach suits me best…”

</p><p>“That’s precisely what this battle is intended to reveal. Whether your strategy leans toward defeating the enemy or safeguarding your own interests, being cognizant of both aspects will guide your path. Don’t engage in battle aimlessly. Stay mindful. By doing so, you’ll perceive significant shifts in the world around you.” 

</p><p>As Horikita closed her eyes, murmuring softly to herself, I observed her silently, awaiting signs of comprehension.

</p><p>“To be frank, I’m not sure I can sustain that level of awareness at present.” 

</p><p>“I understand.”

</p><p>“But I’ll keep reminding myself of it until the special exam arrives. And if that doesn’t suffice, I’ll continue doing so even afterward. I’m uncertain how far I can go... I’m sorry. I feel inadequate...” 

</p><p>“There’s nothing amiss. You’re already beginning to be aware. I’ve initiated that awareness.” 

</p><p>It was merely a matter of time for it to become fully realized— whether that happened today, tomorrow, or a bit later.

</p><p>My analysis of Horikita Suzune, the individual, was nearly complete. 

</p><p>She was a person with above-average competence, capable of earning recognition in society. 

</p><p>With qualifications to lead a fulfilling life on the lengthy journey ahead. 

</p><p>However, she might not achieve extraordinary feats or leave behind a legacy for future generations. 

</p><p>Her talents were not exceptional enough to surpass the numerous abilities of others.

</p><p>Yet, this was not the broader society; it was a school— a realm where young, inexperienced individuals are gathered. 

</p><p>In this miniature, nurturing environment, she possessed the potential to exhibit unimaginable abilities. 

</p><p>This newfound perspective, instilled by Horikita Manabu, enabled me to recognize her latent brilliance. 

</p><p>Without his guidance, I might have overlooked her shining potential.

</p><p>“That’s all I wanted to say.”

</p><p>Horikita gazed directly into my eyes, her stare unwavering.

</p><p>“What exactly are you?” 

</p><p>“What do you mean?” 

</p><p>“That's precisely what I mean. I find you quite puzzling…”

</p><p>“Do you feel the need to understand?”

</p><p>“Well, as the appointed leader, it wouldn't hurt to familiarize myself with my classmates. Even for upcoming special exams, having insight could be advantageous.”

</p><p>Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of individuals in specific challenges could indeed prove beneficial.

</p><p>“So, do you comprehend Koenji?”

</p><p>“I wouldn't say I fully understand him, but I believe I have a sense of him. Am I mistaken?”

</p><p>“...You're spot on.”

</p><p>I mentioned Koenji to shift the focus away from myself, yet it was straightforward to discern his character.

</p><p>“You initially showed little interest in reaching Class A, and you were generally reserved and aloof. But then, you began dating Karuizawa-san, and you started contributing to the class, knowing it would draw attention. Your actions lack consistency.”

</p><p>“Perhaps you could view it as personal growth? A once timid middle schooler embarks on his high school journey, gradually gaining confidence. Eventually, he sets his sights on Class A and becomes enthusiastic, leading to his current state—something like that.”

</p><p>“I don't see it that way. You defy conventional categorization. I'm convinced of that. There's always a deeper motive behind your actions. Because…”

</p><p>As soon as she uttered 'because,' Horikita faltered, unable to continue.

</p><p>“...How does one develop such a personality, I wonder. What were you like as a child?”

</p><p>“Changing the subject, huh? Even if you ask about my childhood, I'm still young, as you can see.”

</p><p>“That's not what I'm asking. I mean when you were much younger. Which elementary school did you attend?”

</p><p>“You wouldn't recognize it even if I told you.”

</p><p>“That's not necessarily true, is it? I might unexpectedly be familiar with the area.”

</p><p>“I've already touched on something similar before. I'm not inclined to revisit it.”

</p><p>“...Is that so? Apologies, but I don't remember. Could you please tell me again?”

</p><p>Despite my attempts to avoid it, Horikita persisted with her questioning.

</p><p>“It's not something I'm comfortable sharing. There are certain aspects I prefer to keep private.”

</p><p>I made it clear that I was uncomfortable with further inquiries, and Horikita seemed to reluctantly understand.

</p><p>With a lot of information to process, Horikita's mind appeared notably fatigued.

</p><p>“You should take a break to relax.” 

</p><p>I suggested to Horikita, who seemed indecisive about her next move.

</p><p>“Yes, you're right…”

</p><p>Before we could leave, we needed to finish our drinks.

</p><p>I also picked up my barely touched cup of coffee, and we both drank almost simultaneously.

</p><p>The liquid that touched my tongue was lukewarm.
</p>
<img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 10/Images/image2.webp" alt="illustration 1">
<p>“It's gotten cold.”

</p><p>“It’s gotten cold, hasn't it?”

</p><p>“Don't copy me.”

</p><p>“Please don’t copy me.”

</p><p>It was a trivial exchange, yet the sense of being in sync was oddly amusing.

</p><p>“Eh—?”

</p><p>While it might be an overstatement to say she was startled, Horikita widened her eyes and emitted a sound.

</p><p>“What's the matter?”

</p><p>“It's just... I noticed... you smiled a bit…”

</p><p>“Huh? And what's wrong with that?”

</p><p>“It's just that it feels like I haven't seen that expression on your face in the past two years…”

</p><p>“How rude. I'm not a baby who's just learned to smile.”

</p><p>Similar remarks had been made before, and there were numerous occasions where I consciously attempted to smile. 

</p><p>It shouldn't be such a rare occurrence. 

</p><p>Well... But…

“You're correct, it might have been a rare moment.”

</p><p>In that instant, I couldn't recall ever consciously trying to smile. 

</p><p>It was the expression of an involuntary emotion. How many such instances had I experienced thus far?

</p><p>Neither an intentional act nor a response to the atmosphere, simply being genuine.
</p><p>Understanding the difficulty of that, it became intriguing.

</p><p>It felt as though a splash of color had been added to a blank canvas.

</p><p>Not in front of Kei, nor in the presence of a friend like Yosuke.

</p><p>I couldn't explain why that expression emerged in front of Horikita.

</p><p>“I wonder why I smiled. Would you happen to know if you were the one who smiled?”

</p><p>I had hoped for a clear answer from Horikita. 

</p><p>I inquired if it was due to a humorous moment, meeting her gaze directly. 

</p><p>However, Horikita avoided eye contact and hastily responded.

</p><p>“I... I wouldn't have a clue even if you asked me with such a serious expression.”

</p><p>“So, it wasn't because something particularly amusing occurred, right?”

</p><p>“...As I mentioned, I wouldn't be able to tell you even if you asked.”

</p><p>Horikita, now looking away, raised her voice slightly and sighed.

</p><p>“Because of your peculiar way of thinking, I feel foolish for laughing as well…”

</p><p>She quickly finished her coffee and rose from her seat.

</p><p>“Are we finished with our conversation? I have some plans, so I should get going.”

</p><p>“Didn't you mention you didn't have any plans?”

</p><p>“I just remembered I do have plans.”

</p><p>With that, she picked up her empty cup.

</p><p>“I'll contemplate it on my own. About the upcoming special exam and everything else.”

</p><p>“That's fine.”

</p><p>She was about to leave but paused as if recalling something.

</p><p>“Oh, right, my apologies. There's something I need to discuss with you.”

</p><p>“Is it regarding the categories to exclude in the special exam?”

</p><p>“That's correct.”

</p><p>“What about our other classmates?”

</p><p>“I've gathered input from everyone except you. We really need to make a decision soon.”

</p><p>While I had been taking it easy, it seemed that Horikita had already finalized the arrangements with the others.

</p><p>“Well, you probably won't need to exclude anything, but what are your thoughts?”

</p><p>“Entertainment, music, and subculture.”

</p><p>“Those categories aren't related to studying. Same choices as mine.”

</p><p>“There were other categories I was uncertain about, but I opted to exclude those where I lack proficiency.”

</p><p>News, lifestyle, and food.

</p><p> I likely didn't have much knowledge in those areas. 

</p><p>However, the three categories I excluded were considered more challenging.

</p><p>“Alright, I'll note those down for you.”

</p><p>“Thank you.”

</p><p>Unexpectedly, this appeared to be an opportunity for self-reflection.
