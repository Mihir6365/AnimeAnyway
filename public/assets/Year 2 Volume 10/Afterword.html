    <h1>Afterword</h1><p>
It’s really warm right now, isn’t it? This is Kinugasa, of course.

</p><p>I believe that people sometimes randomly awaken to various hobbies and interests. 

</p><p>I started cooking a little while ago, and I’ve been increasing my repertoire while making many trial-and-error attempts to cook delicious dishes, and even getting carried away and buying my own kitchen knife, even though my only hobby used to be watching baseball games.

</p><p>I was impressed that I could get new hobbies even at my age, but then I noticed another change in my hobbies… 

I started buying my child large blocks and stuffed animals as they started growing up, which of course led to more trips to the toy store, and I ended up picking up a pla-rail after getting interested in it. 

</p><p>I knew nothing about trains, but I thought, ‘Huh? It’s so fun just moving it around’, and ended up buying the toys, buying rails and making original courses, and buying radio-controlled trains… 

I also became interested in mini 4-wheelers, nerf, board games, etc… 

This is bad. 

</p><p>There’s way too much stuff I like. 

</p><p>I used to buy toys only for my kid, but before I knew it, I started buying them for myself to play with. 

</p><p>My favourite toy recently is a toy named Bottle-Man that shoots bottle-caps. I remembered that I used to love a toy called B-Daman, (Bottle-Man’s predecessor?) and started collecting them. 

</p><p>I used to be a minimalist and never had a habit of collecting things, so I never thought I’d end up like this… I think B-Daman was a lot more interesting, but that’s probably because I’m now an adult.

</p><p>Personally, I want to get my hands on some LEGO, which is something I really wanted as a kid, but I’m afraid that I’m going to get obsessed with it if I do.

</p><p>Someone stop me! (Give me a push!)

</p><p>Okay. I’ll end my personal report with that, and talk a little about my work.

</p><p>The second term and the winter vacation are finally over, and we’ll be starting the third semester arc from the next volume.

</p><p>Unlike the second term, which was rather long, the third term will end with the same or just a little fewer number of volumes as the first term arc.

</p><p>Well then, everyone, take care in the coming hot season not to get heat stroke.

</p><p>Let’s see each other again when it gets cooler.
