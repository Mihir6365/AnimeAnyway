    <h1>Afterword</h1><p>
It’s really warm right now, isn’t it? This is Kinugasa, of course.

</p><p>I believe that people sometimes randomly awaken to various hobbies and interests. 

</p><p>I started cooking a little while ago, and I’ve been increasing my repertoire while making many trial-and-error attempts to cook delicious dishes, and even getting carried away and buying my own kitchen knife, even though my only hobby used to be watching baseball games.

</p><p>I was impressed that I could get new hobbies even at my age, but then I noticed another change in my hobbies… 

I started buying my child large blocks and stuffed animals as they started growing up, which of course led to more trips to the toy store, and I ended up picking up a pla-rail after getting interested in it. 

</p><p>I knew nothing about trains, but I thought, ‘Huh? It’s so fun just moving it around’, and ended up buying the toys, buying rails and making original courses, and buying radio-controlled trains… 

I also became interested in mini 4-wheelers, nerf, board games, etc… 

This is bad. 

</p><p>There’s way too much stuff I like. 

</p><p>I used to buy toys only for my kid, but before I knew it, I started buying them for myself to play with. 

</p><p>My favourite toy recently is a toy named Bottle-Man that shoots bottle-caps. I remembered that I used to love a toy called B-Daman, (Bottle-Man’s predecessor?) and started collecting them. 

</p><p>I used to be a minimalist and never had a habit of collecting things, so I never thought I’d end up like this… I think B-Daman was a lot more interesting, but that’s probably because I’m now an adult.

</p><p>Personally, I want to get my hands on some LEGO, which is something I really wanted as a kid, but I’m afraid that I’m going to get obsessed with it if I do.

</p><p>Someone stop me! (Give me a push!)

</p><p>Okay. I’ll end my personal report with that, and talk a little about my work.

</p><p>The second term and the winter vacation are finally over, and we’ll be starting the third semester arc from the next volume.

</p><p>Unlike the second term, which was rather long, the third term will end with the same or just a little fewer number of volumes as the first term arc.

</p><p>Well then, everyone, take care in the coming hot season not to get heat stroke.

</p><p>Let’s see each other again when it gets cooler.
</p><p></p> <p>
Corona, the flu, a fracture, and a hernia in my neck. 

</p><p>I’m the Kinugasa full of wounds after facing a rush of problems in this year alone. 

</p><p>I’m still alive and well. I’m Kinugasa.

</p><p>But the numbness and pain in my back from the hernia is severe and likely to linger, and although I’m happy I was able to write this manuscript before the onset of the hernia, but I don’t think I can guarantee it won’t affect me at all in the future…

I struggle daily when sitting on a chair for an hour at a time is my limit.

</p><p>Well, it’s no help to talk about such gloomy things, so let’s switch to a brighter subject.

</p><p>Congratulations to the Hanshin Tigers for winning the league championship after 18 years!!!

</p><p>Thank you for the inspiration! Thank you for the excitement! Toraho!!! [TL Note - A cheer used by the fans of Hanshin Tigers (baseball team). 'Tora' means 'tiger'. ]

</p><p>Yes. At least let me say that much. 

</p><p>It’s okay, right? I mean, it’s been 18 years. 

</p><p>I bought a lot of stuff, you know. 

</p><p>A hat and a shirt I wear everywhere. 

</p><p>That’s okay, right? I mean, it’s been 18 years. 

</p><p>And this old man also buys seals, stickers and towels.

</p><p>The afterword will be 1 page this time, so… Sorry, I guess I have no space left to touch on Volume 10’s contents. 

</p><p>I’ll do my best next time. 

</p><p>I will not be defeated by the pain in my back..!
