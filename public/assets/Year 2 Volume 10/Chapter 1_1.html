    <h3>Part 1</h3>
   <p>
The winter vacation is over, but nothing fundamental has changed for the students, nor the teachers. 

</p><p>Chabashira-sensei arrived at the classroom and put her hands on the teacher’s table after a short greeting for the new year. 

</p><p>“The 3rd semester is starting now. They say time goes fastest until March after a new year, and we’re going to be through with this semester in no time. Be careful not to fall into your habits.”

</p><p>No one pointed it out, but the hair on the back of her head drew my interest a little. It’s very faint, but it looks like she has bed hair. 

</p><p>Maybe she woke up late this morning and had to come here in a hurry. This makes her warning to the students less convincing. 

</p><p>Chabashira-sensei finished the morning homeroom and was heading out when she stopped right before the door. She turned around, and said:

</p><p>“I forgot to tell you something. We’re holding the first student-teacher meeting of the school next month. Other than the students’ activities so far, it’s going to be centered around job-searching. Of course, we’ve already conducted interview surveys with your parents.” 

</p><p>I’m sure there are some students who decide their future by themselves, but most consider their parents’ advice as well. 

</p><p>This shows that the school is always working, even while the students aren’t here.

</p><p>“I didn’t expect this school to do something like that too. I never thought this would happen.” 

</p><p>Ike was the first one to make his remark before the other students. 

</p><p>No one is surprised. 

</p><p>“High school isn’t compulsory education, but they can’t just ignore the parents’ opinions and let the student decide their future all alone. I bet  there’s going to be a parent-teacher meeting too.” 

</p><p>Parent-teacher meeting. 

</p><p>Does that mean that it’s possible that man may make a visit here again? 

</p><p>No, he did say we’d never see each other at this school again, but who knows? 

</p><p>At any rate, the student-teacher meeting is happening next month. 

</p><p>Of course, they could just tell me that it’s pointless for me as I’m not free to decide on anything about my future.

</p><p>In that sense, I’m very grateful that Chabashira-sensei knows about my circumstances. 

</p><p>We’ll probably get it over with in an official manner, without any deep discussion. 

</p><p>On the contrary, the student-teacher meeting and the parent-teacher meeting are definitely going to be a big crossroads for the other students. 

</p><p>Will they continue straight on their own path, or choose a detour and look for another one? 

</p><p>Their parents and teacher should be able to show them tracks that they cannot see by themselves. 

</p><p>“You can come and ask me if there’s anything you want to know.” 

</p><p>After telling us what she needed to, Chabashira-sensei put her hand on the door. 

</p><p>Then, I saw her touching the back of her head as she closed the door behind her.

</p><p>It looks like she noticed her bed hair.
