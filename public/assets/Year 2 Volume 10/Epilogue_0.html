For Kamuro to come out?”</p><p>“It looks like you heard about her somewhere.”</p><p>“Kitou told me when I went to check up on Class-A.” </p><p>“He’s not the type who talks a lot, but I guess friendly relationships can be surprising.”</p><p>“I thought it might be tasteless, but I decided to visit anyway. It’s not as if we were very close, but this will be my last opportunity to see her. I figured I should at least say goodbye.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>In truth, I don’t care about saying goodbye to Kamuro. </p><p>However, Sakayanagi can’t refuse my presence here after I say this.</p><p>I stood by Sakayanagi and stared at the staff room’s door.</p><p>“I suppose you can understand what happened just by looking at the special test’s events.”</p><p>“Yeah. I can guess the origin of your defeat. Were you able to determine who it was?”</p><p>“Yes. I’m already finished with that work.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>If so, that issue will be sternly dealt with by Sakayanagi at a later date.</p><p>Kamuro delicately left the staff room by the time the sun was about to go down.</p><p>Maybe she didn’t expect to see anyone here, because she had a very surprised expression on her face.</p><p>“What are you two doing?”</p><p>“We were waiting for you. Is that alright?”</p><p>“It’s fine, but why?”</p><p>It seems Kamuro has accepted reality better than I expected.</p><p>“We’re going to leave each other today. I wanted to talk to you one last time.”</p><p>“Wait, are you telling me you have some semblance of conscience? Unlikely. What about you Ayanokoji-kun?”</p><p>“It’s an educational visit.”</p><p>“Huh..? Ugh. I don’t get it, as usual.”</p><p>“An unexpected student was expelled, it would be a lie to say I’m not curious.”</p><p>“I’m unexpected? Even though I’m someone who has no problems with shoplifting?”</p><p>“That’s in the past. At the very least, from a comprehensive point of view, you weren’t a human of low position among the class. I don’t know which method Sakayanagi made her choice by. It’s no wonder I think this was unexpected, is it?”</p><p>I didn’t touch on this part, but she was close to Sakayanagi.</p><p>“I had the expulsion decided by lottery.”</p><p>“That’s-”</p><p>“Do you think it’s unlike me?”</p><p>“Maybe. I’d like to ask how Kamuro feels, as she was expelled by the lottery.”</p><p>I didn’t know if she would answer so soon after her expulsion, but I’ll try asking.</p><p>“I’m impressed you can ask that with such a stupid serious face.” </p><p>Perhaps not expecting her feelings to be questioned, Kamuro started thinking after being surprised.</p><p>“It just feels strange. I’ve been living a normal student life until this morning. I was thinking about lame stuff like how to spend the next vacation. Then, a sudden expulsion. This was the only thing I never expected.”</p><p>It’s no wonder she didn’t feel a strong sense of danger, as she was not a student who could be abandoned straight away. </p><p>She probably didn’t expect Sakayanagi to lose either.</p><p>“This is my responsibility. I have done wrong by you.”</p><p>“No, you don’t need to go there.”</p><p>Kamuro quickly opposed Sakayanagi’s remark, which was close to an apology.</p><p>“I’m not going to make it your fault. I don’t expect you to do anything either. I was always fine with the possibility of being expelled like this.”</p><p>Kamuro’s behaviour was never good in the first place. </p><p>Perhaps she was already ready to deal with this, as she really seemed thoroughly laid-back.</p><p>Not wanting to keep chatting in front of the staff room, Kamuro started walking away.</p><p>Sakayanagi, even with her bad leg, chased after her with faster steps than usual.</p><p>We’re all going the same way anyhow, so I suppose it shouldn’t be a problem to walk together.</p><p>“I was waiting ready to receive one or two complaints, you know.”</p><p>“Don’t need it.”</p><p>“What are you going to do after school?”</p><p>“It looks like there are a few high schools that would accept me as a transfer student if I pass their test. My parents are pestering me about going to school, so that’s what I’ll do for now.”</p><p>It seems that Kamuro already decided on a path for herself in this short time.</p><p>The distance between Kamuro and Sakayanagi is gradually getting farther.</p><p>It’s difficult for Sakayanagi to catch up while Kamuro isn’t keeping to her pace. </p><p>She tried to hurry up and walk faster to catch up to her, but she leaned forwards and fell on knees with her hands on the floor after moving in a way she isn’t used to.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Kamuro turned around, sighed and came back to gently pick Sakayanagi up.</p><p>“I won’t be here from tomorrow, so you should find a replacement already.”</p><p>“I know… Kamuro-san.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Kamuro replied with an annoyed expression.</p><p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p><p>Sakayanagi was about to say something, but stopped.</p><p>Kamuro tilted her neck, then picked up the cane to give it to Sakayanagi and started walking away again.</p><p>Sakayanagi didn’t mind the danger and started chasing after her again.</p><p>“Isn’t there anything you want to say to me?”</p><p>She turned around again as she approached the front door.</p><p>“Huh? What, do you want me to blame you? Or ask you why you expelled me?”</p><p>“That’s not it. I just have a responsibility to hear you out.”</p><p>“How pointless.”</p><p>Kamuro stopped there, but hesitated when she looked at Sakayanagi’s eyes.</p><p>“Ugh. You know… You’re pretty wise, but also stupid sometimes, which I’m only now realizing.”</p><p>“I won’t allow you to call me stupid. What do you mean-” </p><p>“If you have a responsibility to hear me out, then shut up and listen.”</p><p>Sakayanagi lost a point there.</p><p>“Well, then. I have no lingering attachments to this school, but you need to promise me one thing.”</p><p>“Promise? To do what?”</p><p>“It’s not for me. Make sure that the guy who betrayed the class ends up on the same road. Can you promise me that?”</p><p>“Is that your wish?”</p><p>“Yes. That’s all. Can you do it?”</p><p>“I promise. I will never forgive the traitor. I promise I will deal with them. Of course, I will also not allow them to put the class in a situation where it will lose.”</p><p>Kamuro nodded once in reply to Sakayanagi’s declaration, and turned her eyes towards me behind her.</p><p>“It’s your responsibility to contact me and let me know whether she holds her promise or not, Ayanokoji.”</p><p>“It seems a little pointless to take on that responsibility, but I hear you.” </p><p>“Good, then. Sorry, but this is it for us. I’m not a student here any more, and you don’t need to look after me now, right?”</p><p>Saying that, Kamuro changed her shoes and ignored Sakayanagi who was taking a while to prepare, and walked out.</p><p>Then, she disappeared towards the dorms without turning around once.</p><p>I suppose that from tomorrow morning, Kamuro will no longer be in this school.</p><p>Including the person in question, it’s doubtful that most students in her class were ready for Kamuro’s expulsion.</p><p>“She acted like herself right up until the end.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“I’m going to take a while longer here. Please leave ahead.”</p><p>I also headed outside the school after Kamuro.</p><p>It seems like Kamuro wasn’t just a simple classmate for Sakayanagi, after all.</p><p></p></div>
