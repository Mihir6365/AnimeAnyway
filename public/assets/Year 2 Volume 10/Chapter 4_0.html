    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
        Having uncovered Mii-chan's benefactor during my day off, the weekend drew to a close.

    </p>
    <p>Despite the passage of Monday and Tuesday without Horikita seeking my advice, a certain boy proposed an
        unexpected plan on Wednesday afternoon, just two days before the special exam.

    </p>
    <p>“Man... I might have the best winning strategy...!”

    </p>
    <p>Ike exclaimed, rising from his seat and slamming his hands on his desk, drawing the attention of everyone in the
        class.

    </p>
    <p>However, rather than anticipation, skepticism filled the air as Ike's girlfriend, Shinohara, expressed surprise
        and doubt.

    </p>
    <p>“No way, Kanji? You Do? How? What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Seriously. Wait… Let me rethink a little...”

    </p>
    <p>Taking a moment to recalibrate, Ike began counting on his fingers before resorting to his phone for assistance.

    </p>
    <p>Despite the gradual departure of classmates who deemed the idea unworthy, Ike remained oblivious, nodding
        confidently as if he had completed his calculations.

    </p>
    <p>“This idea is foolproof! Can I share it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Let's discuss it seriously, but not here,” Horikita interjected, signalling her seriousness about the matter.

    </p>
    <p>“Uh, okay. It’d be bad if my foolproof strategy got leaked.”

    </p>
    <p>“Horikita-san, let’s go to the usual location.”

    </p>
    <p>Recognizing the need for discretion, Yosuke suggested moving to their usual meeting spot, hinting at their
        frequent secretive discussions in preparation for the special exam.

    </p>
    <p>“Those interested can join us, but let's keep the group manageable,” Horikita added, inviting participation while
        cautioning against overcrowding.

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara, Hondo, and Miyamoto were quick to raise their hands, but beyond them, there was little enthusiasm for
        Ike's idea.

    </p>
    <p>However, I found myself intrigued by what kind of strategy Ike was so confident about, prompting me to raise my
        hand casually.

    </p>
    <p>“You too? What made you change your mind all of a sudden? What’s the reason?”

    </p>
    <p>She demanded an explanation from me, unlike the others who seemed content with Ike's plan.

    </p>
    <p>“Can't I just be curious? Ike seems really sure about this winning strategy, and I want to know more.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. That's fair enough. I didn't have any other plans for today anyway.”

    </p>
    <p>She relented after considering my response.

    </p>
    <p>With that settled, the six of us left the school and made our way to Keyaki Mall, ultimately ending up at the
        karaoke.

    </p>
    <p>It was the ideal spot for a private discussion, equipped with snacks and a bar for drinks, all at a reasonable
        price.

    </p>
    <p>“Satsuki, sticking with your usual?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yep. And you, Kanji?”

    </p>
    <p>Ike and Shinohara seemed comfortable as they perused the menu and exchanged familiar banter.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, Horikita.”

    </p>
    <p>“What?”

    </p>
    <p>“Isn't it weird that you have to buy a drink at karaoke even if you're not singing? Shouldn't it be all about the
        music?”

    </p>
    <p>“Hmm, now that you mention it... But you think about the strangest things.”

    </p>
    <p>“Come on, Ayanokoji. It's probably just their one-drink policy.”

    </p>
    <p>Ike chimed in, having overheard our conversation. I didn't press further, not wanting to disrupt Shinohara's
        focus on Ike.

    </p>
    <p>I reached for the terminal to check the latest music trends.

    </p>
    <p>“Hmm... interesting.”

    </p>
    <p>I couldn't fully grasp it.

    </p>
    <p>While some song titles were familiar, many were unknown to me.

    </p>
    <p>It seemed that Asian songs from outside Japan were dominating the charts, showcasing a remarkably high level of
        quality.

    </p>
    <p>“Just your order left, Ayanokoji-kun,”

    </p>
    <p>With everyone else's orders placed, I settled on plum kelp tea.

    </p>
    <p>Horikita efficiently completed the orders, and we awaited their arrival, eager to avoid any interruptions during
        our discussion.

    </p>
    <p>Shortly after, our drinks arrived, and as I lifted my freshly served plum kelp tea to my lips, I realized it was
        scalding hot.

    </p>
    <p>“Ouch... Sorry, please continue,”

    </p>
    <p>After enduring everyone's scrutinizing stares, I redirected my attention to the conversation.

    </p>
    <p>The tip of my tongue was burning so hot that it was numbing. I would have to be careful while drinking.

    </p>
    <p>“Ahem, let's hear Ike-kun's idea,”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita prompted her demeanour to be serious and focused, signalling the importance of the discussion.

    </p>
    <p>Ike, in turn, appeared slightly tense as he began to present his unconventional plan.

    </p>
    <p>“To the point, then. Suppose we secure 68 points for our class. Would that be sufficient for victory?”

    </p>
    <p>After sharing a subtle wink with Shinohara, Ike presented an intriguing idea.

    </p>
    <p>“Sixty-eight points? Well, achieving that score could indeed put us in a favourable position for victory, but
        it's quite specific.”

    </p>
    <p>The unpredictability surrounding the exam tasks made it challenging to estimate each class's potential point
        accumulation.

    </p>
    <p>Despite this uncertainty, Ike asserted confidently that we could secure exactly 68 points, which left Horikita
        feeling uneasy.

    </p>
    <p>Sensing her skepticism, Ike took a swig from his soda bottle to wet his throat before elaborating on his freshly
        conceived solution.

    </p>
    <p>“It's a bit risky, but we could aim for precisely 68 points. Here's how: we simulate sickness right at the start
        of the exam. With our class consisting of 38 students, if we leave only five for defense, plus the leader, and
        eliminate the remaining 32…”

    </p>
    <p>“What? That would mean a 32-point deduction right off the bat! Are you even aware of the rules?”

    </p>
    <p>Hondo interjected, his frustration evident as he leaned forward and sighed heavily.

    </p>
    <p>Despite Hondo's skepticism, Horikita listened intently, recognizing the logic behind the strategy; a 32-person
        elimination would indeed secure 68 points, ensuring a deliberate deduction from the total 100.

    </p>
    <p>“Even with a deduction of 32 points for the eliminated students, we'll still reach our target of 68 points.”

    </p>
    <p>Hondo and Miyamoto appeared bewildered by this revelation, while Shinohara, possibly already familiar with the
        strategy, wore a knowing smile.

    </p>
    <p>“But, consider this: the opponent can only nominate five students, right? We can safeguard five students each
        round, but with only five students remaining to nominate..."

    </p>
    <p>“Ee…”

    </p>
    <p>Miyamoto caught on before Hondo, and let out a sound.

    </p>
    <p>“So, for all 20 turns, we could potentially earn 5 points each. That's a perfect score, isn't it?”

    </p>
    <p>Ike had proposed—an idea I hadn't anticipated from him.

    </p>
    <p>“And on top of that! Nobody would even need to study for the exam! Not a bad concept, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“But, even so, would the school really allow 32 people to feign illness? I mean, it seems too suspicious.”

    </p>
    <p>Hondo voiced his doubts about the plan's feasibility.

    </p>
    <p>“It certainly looks like something underhanded.”

    </p>
    <p>Miyamoto echoed Hondo's skepticism, noting the dubiousness of having 32 students pretend to be ill
        simultaneously.

    </p>
    <p>“Feigning illness... It's a bit of a gray area in terms of the rules, but I doubt the school could intervene,
        even if they found it suspicious. There's no way to prove we've faked it.”

    </p>
    <p>I reasoned, acknowledging the potential loophole in the rules.

    </p>
    <p>Under normal circumstances, the notion of 32 students falling ill simultaneously would be implausible.

    </p>
    <p>As a result, while the school might strongly suspect the illness was feigned, they wouldn't be able to
        conclusively prove it.

    </p>
    <p>They would have no choice but to accept it, adhering to the rule that students who fall ill are treated as
        eliminated.

    </p>
    <p>There were no restrictions on the number of students who could fall ill.

    </p>
    <p>“That sounds like a promising approach for you. It's a method that could help maintain a high average score.”

    </p>
    <p>“See? See? What do you think of this strategy!?”

    </p>
    <p>With Horikita unexpectedly praising it, even Hondo, who was initially doubtful, began to see its value.

    </p>
    <p>“A plan to secure 68 points... That's quite impressive, isn't it?”

    </p>
    <p>“I was taken aback when I first heard it from Kanji. It's a sound idea, don't you think?”

    </p>
    <p>While the emphasis was on ensuring a score of 68 points, there were other advantages to consider.

    </p>
    <p>The strategy didn't rely on skills, luck, or prior preparation.

    </p>
    <p>It could be put into action immediately before the exam, and no other class could hinder or prevent us from
        reaching 68 points.

    </p>
    <p>Moreover, in the worst-case scenario of finishing last, we could select one of the 32 students for expulsion.

    </p>
    <p>This made it easier to remove a less capable student.

    </p>
    <p>Although deciding whom to expel from the 32 students would be challenging, if we prearranged the selection and
        obtained their consent, the aftermath would be smoother.

    </p>
    <p>The risk of expulsion could be nullified if someone with a Protection Point was made to withdraw.

    </p>
    <p>At first glance, the idea seemed reasonable, but its adoption was unlikely.

    </p>
    <p>"If it weren't for a certain rule in this special exam, we might have considered implementing Ike's interesting
        idea."

    </p>
    <p>Horikita replied, indicating that the rule posed a significant challenge to the plan.

    </p>
    <p>It appeared that Horikita could foresee significant obstacles as she listened to the proposal.

    </p>
    <p>“Why? Well, I'm not insisting that you adopt it…”

    </p>
    <p>Ike's idea seemed to be the most promising, prompting him to inquire further.

    </p>
    <p>“Let's assume that Ryuen's class implements this strategy immediately after the exam begins.”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita initiated her discussion based on the assumption that the hypothetical adversary would adopt Ike's
        strategy.

    </p>
    <p>“Even though one person has been expelled from their class, the addition of Katsuragi has maintained their
        numbers at 40. Excluding the leader and five others, they would have 34 eliminations, securing 66 points. While
        this is a respectable score, it also means they cannot surpass it. If the remaining three classes each score 67
        points or more, this approach becomes a 'no-win' strategy.”

    </p>
    <p>Once they've expelled their expendable resources, they have no means to increase their scores.

    </p>
    <p>As the aggressor, they can only hope for the other side to make mistakes.

    </p>
    <p>“True, but there's no guarantee that the other three classes will each achieve 67 points or more, right? While
        there might be a risk of finishing last, isn't there a higher chance of finishing first?”

    </p>
    <p>“No. Most likely, if Ryuen's class were to adopt that strategy, they would end up in last place.”

    </p>
    <p>“Why? We won't know the difficulty of the questions until the actual exam, right? Right—”

    </p>
    <p>Ike couldn't comprehend why this would almost certainly result in them finishing last.

    </p>
    <p>“Listen up. If they're planning to deploy the feigned illness tactic for mass eliminations, they should do it
        right off the bat. There's little advantage in executing this plan after the second round.”

    </p>
    <p>The longer they delay, the greater the risk of reducing their maximum attainable points.

    </p>
    <p>“Furthermore, this strategy is quite conspicuous. All three classes would catch on quickly. Just picture the
        scenario when they realize what's happening. Will they think, 'Oh, they've made a clever move'?”

    </p>
    <p>“W-Will they?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, quite the opposite. If they go for that strategy, it would actually simplify things for the other three
        classes.”

    </p>
    <p>With that, Horikita picked up her cellphone from beside her and displayed it to him.

    </p>
    <p>“A cellphone...? Oh, we can use it during the exam, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yes. So, as soon as we discern their intentions, we can utilize this to collaborate with the other classes. If
        Ryuen's class can only reach 66 points, the other three should band together and aim higher. If they identify a
        struggling class, Ichinose and Sakayanagi will also consider this option positively.”

    </p>
    <p>“Wait, I'm not entirely following, but if we unite against them, they'd lose?”

    </p>
    <p>“They would. Who to nominate, who to protect. Just by doing this, the two classes targeted by Ryuen's class would
        assuredly secure 50 points each. Consequently, they'd only need to earn 17 more points. According to the current
        rules, they can increase the difficulty using points, but if the score is zero or less, they're restricted to
        the base difficulty. Thus, surpassing 17 points wouldn't pose much difficulty.”

    </p>
    <p>If they could achieve an accuracy rate higher than 34%, that would suffice.

    </p>
    <p>Regardless of how unclear the questions might be, maintaining a percentage above this threshold would keep them
        in a safe position.

    </p>
    <p>Moreover, with the added protection element, the required accuracy rate could be slightly lower.

    </p>
    <p>The fixed score of 66 points, while it could be advantageous, also harboured a significant drawback. It was a
        strategy vulnerable to shifts in subsequent circumstances.

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen's class, facing 34 eliminations from the start, wouldn't experience a positive shift until after the
        conclusion of the 7th defensive turn.

    </p>
    <p>If they opted for a high difficulty level in their attacks, their final score would diminish with each turn,
        decreasing to 65 points, 64 points, and so forth.

    </p>
    <p>“I believe you understand the difference between aiming for victory with 66 points and securing 17 or more points
        independently within 10 turns.”

    </p>
    <p>Upon hearing the explanation, Ike, initially jubilant, slumped his shoulders as if crestfallen.

    </p>
    <p>“Damn! I thought we had a shot at winning! I feel guilty for rallying everyone together!”

    </p>
    <p>Ike's unexpected disappointment left Horikita slightly flustered.

    </p>
    <p>“You don’t need to apologize. Your strategy was well-considered. I'm the one who should apologize for assuming
        from the outset that it wouldn't be beneficial.”

    </p>
    <p>“Uh, well... It's a mix of emotions.” Ike admitted.

    </p>
    <p>“Your strategy does hold potential for victory. If the other three classes fail to cooperate, our chances would
        improve. Even if they team up against us, there's still a possibility of winning. For classes with lower
        abilities, relying on this strategy isn't a bad idea. However, I believe our class possesses the capability to
        succeed without resorting to such methods.”

    </p>
    <p>That's why we wouldn't adopt Ike's brilliant strategy, Horikita clarified.

    </p>
    <p>“You've imparted something valuable to me as well.”

    </p>
    <p>“Something valuable...?”

    </p>
    <p>“It became apparent that this special exam would pose challenges if the other classes unite against us.”

    </p>
    <p>The alternating offense and defense dynamics in the first and second halves would entail both classes attacking
        and defending against each other, essentially engaging in a mutual struggle.

    </p>
    <p>However, if the two classes were to collaborate, they could certainly secure 50 points.

    </p>
    <p>With the cooperation of all three classes, achieving a perfect score of 100 points wasn't out of reach.

    </p>
    <p>However, whether the other classes would readily accept this approach remained uncertain.

    </p>
    <p>Collaboration would entail progressing toward the goal at a unified pace.

    </p>
    <p>Ideally, it could lead to a sudden-death scenario in the final round, although orchestrating such an outcome
        would be challenging.

    </p>
    <p>Considering the current point differentials among the four classes, Ryuen's and Ichinose's classes—the bottom
        two—would seek to accumulate as many class points as possible.

    </p>
    <p>Naturally, Horikita's class also aimed to ascend slightly higher.

    </p>
    <p>While it wouldn't be overly difficult to isolate Class A as the sole adversary, merely impeding those above them
        couldn't be deemed an ideal progression.

    </p>
    <p>Ultimately, in this exam, only one class could emerge as the absolute victor.

    </p>
    <p>“You showed courage by speaking up.”

    </p>
    <p>“I See, if that's the case, then, um, good. Hehe.”

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps gratified by Horikita's acknowledgment, Ike nervously scratched the back of his head.

    </p>
    <p>“To Shinohara-san, Hondo-kun, and Miyamoto-kun, as well. Please don't hesitate to share any ideas you may have.
        Additionally, relay this message to classmates who aren't present here. I assure you, I won't dismiss anyone's
        input right from the start.”

    </p>
    <p>As Horikita emphasized, it was crucial to express any ideas that came to mind. Perfection wasn't the primary
        concern, rather, the goal was to foster discussion and engagement.

    </p>
    <p>Absolutely, Ike's idea wasn't without its flaws, but through the constructive feedback from others, he gained a
        deeper understanding and reluctantly acknowledged their criticisms.

    </p>
    <p>The mere act of engaging in this discussion held profound significance and purpose.

    </p>
    <p>As time passed, the others departed from the karaoke room, their faces adorned with smiles and lively chatter.

    </p>
    <p>“What are your plans after this, Horikita?”

    </p>
    <p>“I'm heading home. While I used to meet Hirata-kun and the others here every day until yesterday, today is a
        well-deserved day off.”

    </p>
    <p>It was commendable to make time for socializing even on a day of rest.

    </p>
    <p>Horikita appeared somewhat disinterested in her karaoke drink; she had barely touched it.

    </p>
    <p>Well, it couldn't exactly be hailed as top-notch quality.

    </p>
    <p>The convenience of being able to consume large quantities quickly and affordably was undeniably appealing.

    </p>
    <p>“I was surprised to see your interest in Ike-kun's idea. While his strategy was intriguing, given your foresight,
        wouldn't you have already envisioned something similar?”

    </p>
    <p>Rather than confirming or denying, I proposed a change of scenery to Horikita.

    </p>
    <p>“How about relocating and continuing our conversation?”

    </p>
    <p>“I don't have any immediate plans after this, but it's rather unusual for you to initiate a discussion. Unless,
        of course, it pertains to any issues with Karuizawa-san, in which case I'd have to politely decline.”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita joked as she rose to settle the bill.

    </p>
    <p>“If that were the case, I'm confident you wouldn't be the ideal mediator, Horikita.”

    </p>
    <p>“Indeed.”

    </p>
    <p>“I'd like to talk into the details of the special exam with you, in private.”

    </p>
    <p>At this, Horikita's eyes widened in surprise.

    </p>
    <p>“You? Interested in discussing the special exam?”

    </p>
    <p>“Is it really that surprising?”

    </p>
    <p>“I do initiate discussions often, but it's not something you typically do, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“It could be.”

    </p>
    <p>I couldn't recall the exact number of conversations initiated by each of us, so I couldn't be certain.

    </p>
    <p>However, it was likely that Horikita had initiated more.

    </p>
    <p>“And I can't always rely on you, so I decided not to unnecessarily seek your assistance this time.”

    </p>
    <p>“I'm not proposing a strategy. I simply want to hear your insights.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. You want to gauge if I'm prepared for the challenge?”

    </p>
    <p>She displayed a slightly irritated and troubled demeanour, akin to that of a simple-minded child.

    </p>
    <p>“Bothered much?”

    </p>
    <p>“Not at all. If that's your intention, it would be difficult for me to find a reason to refuse. Where do you
        suggest we go?”

    </p>
    <p>“How about a cafe? I'm craving some good coffee.”

    </p>
    <p>Plum kelp tea wasn't a bad choice either, but my palate needed a hint of bitterness now.

    </p>
    <p>“Would it be overly cautious if I mentioned that I'm concerned about others eavesdropping?”

    </p>
    <p>“No need to worry; it won't be an issue like you fear.”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, as long as you're confident, then there shouldn't be any problem. Shall we leave right away?”

    </p>
    <p>She placed her trust in me without hesitation, and together, we exited the karaoke.
