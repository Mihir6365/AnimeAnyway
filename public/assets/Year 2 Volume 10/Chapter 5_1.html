    <h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>
Sakayanagi seemed indifferent to the set time and place, whether it was a karaoke box, a secluded dorm room, the special wing, or even behind the gym—there were secret meeting spots everywhere. 

</p><p>It seemed she didn't mind, as she wasn't one to divulge secrets.

</p><p>As was our routine, we headed to the bustling cafe in Keyaki Mall today. 

</p><p>Sakayanagi appeared to be enjoying her leisure time, selecting a popular seat with Kamuro and Kito trailing behind her.

</p><p>“My apologies, Hime-san. I'm a bit late.”

</p><p>I said as I took a seat, continuing to address Sakayanagi as 'Hime-san.'

</p><p>“You seem quite close to her, don't you?”

</p><p>“Ah, where did you see that?” 

</p><p>Until last year, I only needed to be wary of Class A students, but as we entered our second year, I had to also be cautious of the underclassmen and others. 

</p><p>Did I overlook something? 

</p><p>No, if there were any first-year students in the second-year hall, I should have noticed. 

</p><p>That meant—had she secretly placed a pawn within the class beforehand? 

</p><p>Most of the time, it was Kamuro, Kito, or myself, but occasionally Sakayanagi would discreetly contact someone on her phone for information. 

</p><p>I had inquired about it before, but she never directly disclosed who they were. 

</p><p>It was possible they were keeping an eye on us.

</p><p>I decided it wasn't urgent to determine if it was a student within the class, but if this wasn't mere coincidence and they were deliberately monitoring me, that would change things.

</p><p>“I'm quite shy when it comes to matters of the heart, so let's keep this between us, alright?”

</p><p>“Hehe, I promise not to breathe a word of it to anyone.”

</p><p>“So, what's on the agenda for today?”

</p><p>“You already know without asking, Masumi-chan.”

</p><p>“Hey. Don't call me by my first name.”

</p><p>“My apologies, my apologies. It's just a habit.”

</p><p>“What kind of habit is that? You hardly ever use my first name.”

</p><p>“In my heart, it's always Masumi-chan.”

</p><p>“Gross.”

</p><p>Kamuro vehemently rejected the 'Masumi-chan' nickname, clearly disgusted by it. 

</p><p>I understood. 

</p><p>If I were in her shoes, I'd likely find it creepy too. 

</p><p>However, when playing the fool, such nicknames helped to make an impact.

</p><p>“So, shall we begin, Hime-san? We're discussing the special exam, right?”

</p><p>“Special exam? Oh, you're mistaken, Hashimoto-kun. Today is just a simple tea party.” 

</p><p>Sakayanagi denied my assumption with a laugh. 

</p><p>I exaggerated my reaction accordingly, almost toppling from my chair.

</p><p>“If that's the case, there'd be no need to gather the executive members here, Princess.”

</p><p>“It's for appearances.”

</p><p>“If the other classes catch wind that Class A is holding a strategy meeting, they'll inevitably share information and heighten their sense of competition. They'll stop at nothing to emerge victorious.”

</p><p>“What's the point of all this? I don't understand. Can you clarify?” 

</p><p>I inquired, exasperated by the lack of direction. 

</p><p>“Is there any benefit to it?”

</p><p>“There is. It makes the other three classes more focused, doesn't it?”

</p><p>“...So, it's advantageous?”

</p><p>It seemed more like a disadvantage than a benefit. 

</p><p>I'd prefer if they grew complacent, so why were we needlessly raising their tension?

</p><p>“I want to relish the challenge. Lately, we've been engaging in recreational activities like cultural festivals and school trips.” 

</p><p>Sakayanagi explained. Even if it lowered our chances of victory or brought disadvantages, she prioritized her own amusement. 

</p><p>That had been Sakayanagi's modus operandi as class leader all along. 

</p><p>The class tolerated it because the results were evident. 

</p><p>We steadily accumulated class points. 

</p><p>In other words, if that were no longer the case, Sakayanagi's value would plummet instantly. 

</p><p>I wondered if anyone else foresaw such an uncertain future.

</p><p>After the so-called 'casual tea party' concluded, I made my way to a restroom near the east entrance. 

</p><p>I wasn't there for its intended purpose, nor for a meeting. 

</p><p>It was just an ingrained habit.

</p><p>Entering the last stall, I locked the door and sat on the toilet seat without pulling down my pants. 

</p><p>The stalls in Keyaki Mall were always impeccably clean, devoid of any unpleasant odours.

</p><p>Even if there was a hint of dirtiness or an unusual scent, it wouldn't bother me much. 

</p><p>The music blaring inside the mall was a tad overwhelming, but I leaned forward, resting my arms on my knees, and closed my eyes. 

</p><p>This was the spot; the sanctuary to soothe my mind. It was a place to reconnect with my roots. 

</p><p>In a school where escape routes were limited, it was a precious refuge.

</p><p>“Even here at ANHS, I find myself visiting the restroom out of habit. Breaking habits is truly challenging.”

</p><p>For the next 30 minutes or so, I remained there without checking my phone even once.

</p><p>“Should I head home?”

</p><p>When I noticed the sink was vacant, I stood up, flushed the toilet, washed my hands, dried them, and exited the bathroom.

</p><p>“Looks like the long break is over.” 

</p><p>I muttered to myself.

</p><p>“You startled me. How long have you been here?” 

</p><p>Ryuen, who had been leaning against the wall near the entrance, his phone in hand, chuckled softly.

</p><p>“I was just curious about what you were up to.” he said.

</p><p>“Give me a break. Tomorrow is the special exam, right? If I were seen with you here, it would raise suspicion. Couldn't you have visited my room or found another way?”

</p><p>“If you're innocent, then act with confidence.”

</p><p>“You're asking too much. Keep it brief.”

</p><p>It was acceptable for me to initiate contact with him, but Ryuen unexpectedly reaching out to me was irritating. 

</p><p>Especially since with Ryuen, one could never predict where or what he might say. 

</p><p>However, to grasp the inner workings of the opposing classes, discussions with him were unavoidable. 

</p><p>It was a turbulent sea, but as long as I could navigate it, I could ride the waves.
