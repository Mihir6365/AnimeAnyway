    <h3>Part 1</h3><p>
I go out to Keyaki Mall during my day off. With friends, with my partner, or alone.

</p><p>This facility, which is filled with the only entertainment in our school life, keeps us entertained, but at the cost of consuming our private points.

</p><p>It would be more efficient to just go back and forth between the gym and the dormitory, but I can’t do that.

</p><p>One has to constantly fight against the temptation to have dinner with someone, go to karaoke, or grab an attractive product without thinking. 

</p><p>That’s why I want to spend time without using private points sometimes. 

</p><p>I could shut myself in my room, but I only want to do that when I’m in trouble. 

</p><p>Considering that, I don’t have many choices left. 

</p><p>So, I slipped into my uniform for the first time in 10 days and left the dormitory. 

</p><p>I’m heading for the school in winter vacation. 

</p><p>My destination is the library. 

</p><p>I saw someone’s back for a moment when I was heading to the bookstore shortly before winter break. 

</p><p>Remembering this is what made me decide to go to the library.

</p><p>I’m not sure if she’ll be going there or not right now, though.

</p><p>School was closed for three days, but it will be open again from today, January 4.

</p><p>It’s still early before 11 o’clock, but I’m not the only one going to school, and there were other students here sweating it out during club activities. 

</p><p>I could hear lively voices of the students coming out of everywhere as I stepped inside the school. 

</p><p>I ran into Sakagami-sensei on my way to the library. 

</p><p>“Happy New Year.” 

</p><p>I can’t ignore him, so I greeted him and replied.

</p><p>“Yeah, Happy New Year.”

</p><p>I was greeted by Sakagami-sensei while feeling a little uncomfortable about my lack of club activities. 

</p><p>I was about to walk past him, but he stopped me from behind. 

</p><p>“I see that you’ve been improving your Academic Ability a lot recently. Sudou-kun’s growth is especially wonderful.” 

</p><p>“He’s actually working pretty hard.” 

</p><p>“He’s grown an unbelievable amount since his enrollment and the days he was constantly making trouble. The staff also talks about him in a good way.” 

</p><p>That’s a very good thing. 

</p><p>Sudou’s bad parts were so noticeable that he always had the attention of the teachers, but why is he bringing this subject up now? 

</p><p>“He’s now in B class up from D class, right? And he’s now at a point where he can even see A Class.” 

</p><p>Sakagami-sensei lightly touched his glasses.

</p><p>He felt somehow different from the first time I saw him as the class teacher of the Ryuen Class. 

</p><p>A lot of other people used to find his behaviour repulsive, but it’s less so now. 

</p><p>I feel like this wasn’t the case up until the Uninhabited Island Test, but… 

Since all of their classes are in the same year, Chabashira-sensei, Mashima-sensei and Hoshinomiya-sensei actually have a lot of chances to talk to each other. 

</p><p>On the other hand, maybe it just feels like Sakagami-sensei has changed because I haven’t had any contact with him for a long time. 

</p><p>“I honestly didn’t think your class could grow so much.” 

</p><p>Sakagami-sensei’s words of flattery, which don’t actually feel like he’s praising us. Sakagami-sensei’s gaze behind the lenses of his glasses sharpened immediately after that. 

</p><p>“You changed the class that was seen as an inferior product.” 

</p><p>“No way. I haven’t done anything special. Isn’t it the result of the hard work of everyone in class, starting with the leader Horikita?” 

</p><p>Although I went in with a denial a little stronger than modesty, I’m not certain how well it resonated with Sakagami-sensei. 

</p><p>Three of the classroom teachers in my year know to some extent that I’m a student from a special environment. It wouldn’t be surprising if Sakagami-sensei also knows about this, and even if he did, it wouldn’t be surprising if he realized it by feel. 

</p><p>“It’s true that Sudou-kun’s devotion to his studies and results he achieved is something that no one could force him to do, but… Well, it’s fine. Leaving aside your own ability, you’re going to have to cooperate with them in the near future if they’re getting stronger. Even if you don’t want to.” 

</p><p>I can just show my abilities then. I suppose that’s what he’s saying. 

</p><p>“Are you going to the library now?” 

</p><p>“How did you know?” 

</p><p>“There are few places a student can go at this time other than club activities. Besides, I know that you’re a student who goes to the library a lot.” 

</p><p>That is true, but I didn’t think Sakagami-sensei knew. 

</p><p>I’m sure I never saw him even once at the library. 

</p><p>So, he must have learned about it indirectly. 

</p><p>“Can teachers browse a student’s loan history?” 

</p><p>“Browse your history? Only the librarian can do that. It would be an invasion of privacy for teachers to look into it at a whim.” 

</p><p>“Then how do you know that I’m a student who goes to the library a lot?”

</p><p>“That’s something you can find out when you go to the library. I have a staff meeting for the third term, so excuse me.”

</p><p>Avoiding a direct answer, Sakagami-sensei said so and walked away.

</p><p>His way of speaking of implications bothered me, but since I can’t stop a teacher who’s in a hurry, I decided to go to the library as he had foreseen. 

</p><p>I found that the room was surrounded by silence when I opened the door of the library and stepped inside.

</p><p>This place is supposed to be quiet, but it’s different from that kind of silence.

</p><p>There was complete silence with no one in sight. 

</p><p>Not even the librarian, who should be sitting at the reception desk, could be seen. 

</p><p>Is he away on some kind of chore? 

</p><p>The library isn’t locked, so I don’t think entering it is a problem, but it feels a little uncomfortable. 

</p><p>I thought about keeping watch at the entrance for a while, but I’m sure he will come back sooner or later. 

</p><p>I faintly greeted the empty space and decided to look at books. 

</p><p>I didn’t know what I wanted to read or borrow, but I’m just going to pick up a book if it feels right. 

</p><p>I was looking for a book to borrow when I heard a voice from the other side of the bookshelf. 

</p><p>“Happy New Year, Ayanokoji-kun.”

</p><p>I turned to go around, and I saw that this person was also doing the same, so we ended up passing each other by. 

</p><p>I saw their profile for just a moment. 

</p><p>Then, the person noticed that they missed me and immediately came back. 

</p><p>“We went opposite ways, huh?” 

</p><p>“Yeah.” 

</p><p>It’s Shiina Hiyori, whom I never saw after chatting for a little bit during the school festival. 

</p><p>She’s supposed to be a bookworm who uses the library a lot, but she disappeared for a period of time. 

</p><p>I heard that she’s been back to her old self recently, and it seems that it was true. 

</p><p>“Happy New Years. It’s been a while since we met in the library.” 

</p><p>“Yeah. Any changes?” 

</p><p>“Nope. How about you?” 

</p><p>“I caught a cold for a while at the start of the year. Thankfully, it wasn’t the influenza that was spreading around, so I felt normal after around two days.”

</p><p>We lightly reported each other’s circumstances and changed the subject to books.

</p><p>“We ran into each other here, so I’d like you to recommend me something to loan, Hiyori.” 

</p><p>“Really? I’m happy to hear that.” 

</p><p>There’s no gain in her for choosing a book for someone else to read, but she accepted it. 

</p><p>“I know that you always choose the right books, Hiyori.” 

</p><p>“I’ll definitely be attending to you, then.” 

</p><p>Instead of getting annoyed by this one-sided request, she rather happily clasped her hands together. 

</p><p>“So, what kind of genre do you feel like reading?”

</p><p>“Hmm. I have a lot of free time during the vacation, so maybe a mystery to make me work my head.” 

</p><p>“Mystery, huh?”

</p><p>She didn’t seem to be troubled, and started walking after signaling me to follow her. 

</p><p>It looks like she also knows a lot about that kind of genre.

</p><p>“Have you read The Glass Key?”

</p><p>She pulled out a book that immediately caught my eye as we walked through the library and asked me if I had read it.

</p><p>Dashiell Hammett. 

</p><p>It’s a masterpiece that’s been selected as one of the 100 best mystery novels of all time.

</p><p>“Unfortunately, I read it two years ago.”

</p><p>“It’s not unfortunate, it’s rather impressive. Let me find something else.” 

</p><p>Saying that, she repeatedly recommended mystery novels of the past to me. 

</p><p>I could see that Hiyori’s plan was to start with the famous ones first.

</p><p>“By the way… This doesn’t have anything to do with mystery novels, but… Have you read anything by the author Kaminaisshi?” 

</p><p>“Kaminaisshi? No, I’m not familiar with that name, so probably not.”  

</p><p>I’m relatively familiar with books, but there are still far more authors that I do not know. 

</p><p>If it’s a book I’ve read, though, then I would at least remember the author’s name.

</p><p>“It’s not surprising. He’s not a well-known author at all, and he’s never been a big seller.” 

</p><p>Hiyori answered with a somewhat polite smile. 

</p><p>I thought that she would recommend me something by that author, but she returned to mystery novels after being satisfied by my answer.

</p><p>“Have you read The Secret of the Two Wheeled Carriage? It’s Fergus Hume’s debut work.” 

</p><p>“I haven’t read it.” 

</p><p>“Well, no one is loaning it at the moment, so it might be a good idea to take this one.”

</p><p>After checking out three books, including that one, Hiyori and I moved to the reception area where the librarian had returned. 

</p><p>We wished him a happy New Year., and quickly finished borrowing the books.

</p><p>“See you later, Ayanokoji-kun. Come and hang out again if you want.” 

</p><p>“I think I’ll be here a few times until the third term. You’re gonna stay in the library, right?” 

</p><p>“I don’t have much else to do even with a lot of vacation days.” 

</p><p>“How about hanging out in Keyaki Mall with your friends?” 

</p><p>“I don’t think so.” 

</p><p>Thinking back, I don’t recall ever seeing Hiyori hanging out with her friends in her daily school life. 

</p><p>I have seen her with her classmates for some reason or another, of course, but… 

Perhaps she has even fewer friends than I thought. 

</p><p>I’m sure most students in the Ryuen Class aren’t into literature and art. 

</p><p>She waved goodbye to me and closed the library’s door.
