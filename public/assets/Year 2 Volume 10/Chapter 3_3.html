    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        Keyaki Mall looks different in the evening.

    </p>
    <p>Since Christmas passed, all the trees were already taken down and preparations for the New Year were underway.

    </p>
    <p>There are no cake stores in Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>So, I went to the section of the supermarket where they were selling cakes.
    </p>
    <p>However…

        “Nothing.”

    </p>
    <p>All the usual cakes were on display, but I couldn’t find any discounted ones.

    </p>
    <p>The special Christmas section was also taken down, and I couldn’t even find a whole cake there.

    </p>
    <p>Either all the cakes were already sold out, or they’ve already been moved.

    </p>
    <p>Maybe they didn’t stock any extras since this is on the school’s premises and the number of customers they will
        attract is limited.

    </p>
    <p>It’s not that I particularly wanted a cake, but I feel a little disappointed that there aren’t any here.

    </p>
    <p>That said, this isn’t enough to force me to buy one at the regular price.

    </p>
    <p>This was a wasted trip, but I don’t want to make any unnecessary expenditures here.

    </p>
    <p>I went around the supermarket a couple of times to see if there was anything I needed, but I left the store
        empty-handed after all.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>I was approached from the side when I was just about to leave Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>It was Sakayanagi, who was sitting on a bench and waving at me.

    </p>
    <p>“Leaving already?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah.”

    </p>
    <p>“You were only here for about 15 minutes, though?”

    </p>
    <p>“Were you watching?”

    </p>
    <p>“I saw you just as you left the dorms.”

    </p>
    <p>I see.

    </p>
    <p>So it’s not surprising that she would want to call out to me after I didn’t buy anything.

    </p>
    <p>I explained that I didn’t do anything during Christmas since Kei was sick in bed, and that I had come to the
        supermarket because I thought I might be able to eat some cake at a low price.

    </p>
    <p>“I see.”

    </p>
    <p>“I guess I missed my timing, and the cakes just slipped away.”

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t eat any on the 24th or the 25th, so I don’t think I will eat any this year.

    </p>
    <p>“It was a shame today, but I’m going to eat some next year.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hehe.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi elegantly smiled while sitting on the bench.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s so funny?”

    </p>
    <p>“No one can guarantee that they’ll be able to eat cake at this school next year. Isn’t that right?”

    </p>
    <p>“...Yeah.”

    </p>
    <p>“Especially you, since the life waiting for you if you go back to your parents won’t have anything to do with
        cakes.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’d probably not get any cakes even on my birthdays.”

    </p>
    <p>Maybe I should turn around and go back to the supermarket right now? I’m sure Sakayanagi can see through such
        shallow thoughts of mine, and she stood up using her cane.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way, I would not recommend the supermarket’s cakes.”

    </p>
    <p>“Really?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry to say this, but they’re just mass-produced products that can be found anywhere. They’re definitely
        not the handwork of an artisan.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m limited on the places I can buy cakes at, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“They sell surprisingly good stuff at convenience stores too, you know.”

    </p>
    <p>Is that so?

    </p>
    <p>Actually, I remember that the Mont Blanc Sakayanagi brought me before was also bought at a convenience store.

    </p>
    <p>“If you want a satisfying taste, I guess you’d have no choice but to order one in.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi started walking and stopped beside me.

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe. Could you join me for a little while?”

    </p>
    <p>“Where? It would draw too much attention for me to walk one on one with A Class’ leader.”

    </p>
    <p>“Please don’t worry. We’re not going to be alone for long.”

    </p>
    <p>Right after that, Sakayanagi waved in another direction.

    </p>
    <p>Then, the male student she found quickly approached us.

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry Sakayanagi-san, did I make you wait?”

    </p>
    <p>“You’re just a little late. I was able to kill the time in a fun way though, so it’s not a problem.”

    </p>
    <p>I guess chatting with me is what she means by that.

    </p>
    <p>“Sanada-kun, have you ever talked to Ayanokouji-kun before?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, this is actually my first time today.”

    </p>
    <p>Sanada replied while politely bowing to me.

    </p>
    <p>I’ve seen him many times as a member of the same year, but I’ve never had a chance to talk to him face to face
        like this, so as Sanada said, this is the first time.

    </p>
    <p>His name is Sanada Kousei. His OAA is as follows:

    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="center">
        Academic Ability: A
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        Physical Ability: C+
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        Tactful Thinking: B+
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        Contribution to Society: B+
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        Total: B
    </p>
    <p>
        He is an extremely talented student with an A in Academic Ability.

    </p>
    <p>His Physical Ability is also average, and his other abilities are above average with no outstanding weaknesses.

    </p>
    <p>Although Sanada is a model student, I have never seen him with Sakayanagi before.

    </p>
    <p>I’ve been having more contact with A Class students recently, so I am reminded of how little contact I’ve had
        with Sakayanagi’s classmates.

    </p>
    <p>It seems that the two are not together here by chance.

    </p>
    <p>“I wanted to talk to you at least once, Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>His tone of voice is polite, and his manners are soft.

    </p>
    <p>I don't feel uncomfortable about someone like this of the same gender wanting to talk to me.

    </p>
    <p>“Really?”

    </p>
    <p>I don’t think I’ve done anything to draw Sanada’s attention, though.

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, is that so? What caught your attention?”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi, perhaps speaking for me, asked Sanada.

    </p>
    <p>“He’s been distinguishing himself among those in B Class recently, and———”

    </p>
    <p>Sanada approached me without breaking his smile.

    </p>
    <p>Then, he gently grabbed my right arm and pulled me away from Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, but what’s your relationship with Sakayanagi-san?”

    </p>
    <p>“What do you mean? There isn’t really anything special between us.”

    </p>
    <p>“She’s the leader of Year Two A Class. She’s not someone to approach without a reason.”

    </p>
    <p>I think he’s seeing me as an enemy.

    </p>
    <p>An anger, or rather caution, which I can’t identify, is oozing from the depths of his polite language.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s also puzzling that she’s being so friendly with someone of the opposite gender.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s an interesting expression.

    </p>
    <p>I’d like to say that it’s not true, but that would be difficult.

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi doesn’t take much individual action, and in fact, a high percentage of her conduct is taken with
        multiple people.

    </p>
    <p>Cases of her acting one-on-one, and with the opposite sex, are very limited.

    </p>
    <p>It is a common sight for students in the same class, but not something that people from the other classes would
        be able to grasp the facts about.

    </p>
    <p>No, it isn’t a good idea to think too much about this.

    </p>
    <p>It’s a different issue whether Sanada actually means what he’s saying or not.

    </p>
    <p>If he is saying these remarks intentionally, it’s best I pretend that I don’t understand anything.

    </p>
    <p>“I had a chance to talk with her during the final tests last year. Other than that, there’s nothing between us.”

    </p>
    <p>I should give a steady answer and make things ambiguous here.

    </p>
    <p>Whatever the intention of his question, this is the best answer.

    </p>
    <p>“I see. I understand, I’m sorry. Maybe I asked that in a scary way.”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t mind.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you two men done talking now?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yes. Ayanokouji-kun, would you hang out with me for a while after this if it’s okay? If Sakayanagi-san allows
        it, of course.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hm?”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, what a coincidence, Sanada-kun. I wanted to invite him as well.”

    </p>
    <p>I don’t really get it, but the two seem to have thought the same thing, and laughed while looking at each other.

    </p>
    <p>I was led away from the entrance again by the two and started walking through the mall.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s here.”

    </p>
    <p>We reached a general store after a short while.

    </p>
    <p>It’s a store that specializes in small accessories popular with girls.

    </p>
    <p>Both A Class students entered the store without hesitation and started looking at things.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokouji, please wait a moment. You can look around if you want.”

    </p>
    <p>I was told to look around the store, but without a more detailed explanation, all I could do was to stand by and
        watch.

    </p>
    <p>The background music in the store made it difficult to pick up their whispering conversation, and as I could not
        join it, I had no choice but to move away from them.

    </p>
    <p>Then, I started looking around for no particular reason to kill some time.

    </p>
    <p>I waited for 5, 10 minutes, but their conversation was still going strong and there was no sign that their
        shopping was about to be finished.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 9.5/Images/image5.webp" alt=""><p>
After waiting for a long time, there was nothing left to see in the store. 

</p><p>I approached to check on them and Sanada hurriedly reached into his pocket. 

</p><p>“Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.”

</p><p>He politely asked for permission and walked out of the store.

</p><p>“I had a date with Sanada-kun today. I spent Christmas with him.” 

</p><p>“Really? That’s news to me.”

</p><p>I thought that it felt a little like a date, but it’s still a surprising new truth.

</p><p>However, I had no idea that Sakayanagi had a partner like this.

</p><p>Was there an event before Christmas that caused a major relationship change, or did they have a close relationship already but not disclose it?

</p><p>“Is this okay, though? To be so out in the open. He might be used as a weak-point if others know he is important to you.”

</p><p>There is a difference in difficulty between protecting oneself and protecting a third party.

</p><p>Especially in the case of Sakayanagi, who has a limited range of movement, so the possibility of her falling behind isn’t low.

</p><p>“Of course, I suppose this means you have the confidence for this… What is it?” 

</p><p>Sakayanagi kept quietly staring at me as I made my analysis.

</p><p>No, rather, she’s angry?

</p><p>“Couldn’t you tell that it was just a little joke?”

</p><p>“What was?”

</p><p>“What do you mean? It’s not like Sanada-kun and I arranged to have a date.”

</p><p>“Hmm?”

</p><p>I’m confused, since she was now saying the exact opposite of what she said before.

</p><p>“I’m sorry I made you wait, Sakayanagi-san.”

</p><p>Sanada slowly came back over to us while apologizing after finishing his phone call.

</p><p>“How did it go?”

</p><p>“I made the appointment.”

</p><p>He stroked his own cheeks a little with an embarrassed look on his face and happily smiled.

</p><p>“The person on the other end of the phone is Miya-san from Year 1 B Class. She’s a student who agreed to start dating Sanada-kun the other day. He was confused about what to get her as a present, so I’m helping him out.” 

</p><p>This is completely different than what I was told at first. 

</p><p>Apparently, that was a joke. 

</p><p>I don’t understand what the joke was, but I decided to let it go since I don’t feel like going into it.

</p><p>“I gave her a gift for Christmas, but it’s also her birthday 4 days after that. I thought about combining the two, but we haven’t been dating for that long so I thought it would be better to celebrate twice.”

</p><p>So that’s what this was about.

</p><p>Indeed, it may be difficult to decide how to celebrate it when a person’s birthday is close to another big event like Christmas.

</p><p>It would be easier to celebrate them together, but the person in question may not be so happy about that.

</p><p>“And she’s a junior? What’s the story?”

</p><p>“Club activities. I’m in the concert band, and she’s my junior.” 

</p><p>I see. 

</p><p>I don’t really have any friends in the culture club, so this was a blind spot for me. 

</p><p>I suppose they started learning about each other and deepening their relationship as they spent time together in their club activities. 

</p><p>“I didn’t think you’d give people advice about this kind of thing though, Sakayanagi.” 

</p><p>“I don’t think I’m the right person for the job, but Sanada-kun seems to be keeping this a secret for now. I guess there’s a lot of stuff going on in the club.”

</p><p>She replied while giving me a somewhat disapproving look.

</p><p>I’m not sure if there are restrictions like no dating between seniors or juniors, or no romance for a certain period of time after joining a club.

</p><p>Of course, even if such rules exist, they’re more likely to be unspoken rules among students rather than school rules.

</p><p>If there was such a written rule, it would be impossible to apply it only to the concert band.

</p><p>“I’m not surprised you noticed it, Sakayanagi-san.”

</p><p>The astute Sakayanagi detected the change in her classmates and probably had people gather information about them. 

</p><p>Sanada, too, decided to rely on her.

</p><p>“I understand what happened, but why did you invite me?”

</p><p>It would have made sense if they asked me for advice, but that didn’t happen, and the two of them decided on a gift together.

</p><p>“Well…”

</p><p>Sakayanagi started speaking for Sanada, who had a slightly worried expression.

</p><p>“I just wanted to mess with you a little, Ayanokouji-kun.”

</p><p>“Did you tell him already?”

</p><p>“Yes. It’s not nice, but Ayanokouji-kun wasn’t surprised or even suspicious.” 

</p><p>I was a little surprised, but not suspicious.

</p><p>In the first place, I don’t even have the slightest interest in Sakayanagi dating someone or not.

</p><p>“Please don’t take it seriously. I invited you so that it doesn’t look like a date. What do you think would happen if Miya-san saw Sanada-kun and I walking around together by ourselves?”

</p><p>“There might be a misunderstanding.”

</p><p>With me mixed in, it’s two men and one woman.

</p><p>With that, Sanada’s junior girlfriend will not think that this is a date, I suppose.

</p><p>“I could have invited someone else earlier, but that would reveal the fact that you have a girlfriend, Sanada-kun. I wanted to run into someone by coincidence and invite them then.”

</p><p>So I just happened to be hit by that white feathered arrow.

</p><p>Was it the right answer to talk to her, or not?

</p><p>I was able to acquaint myself with Sanada like this, so it may have been the right answer.

</p><p>I didn’t see what present they bought, but he’s holding it very carefully.

</p><p>I suppose that’s how much he cares about his girlfriend.

</p><p>“Sanada-kun, good luck.”

</p><p>“Yes, thank you Sakayanagi-san.”

</p><p>Sanada held his newly purchased present to his chest and bowed.

</p><p>He walked out with a happy look on his face and straightened his back, so he might be running to her now. 

</p><p>He might even give it to her on the spur of the moment before it’s her birthday.

</p><p>“Oh, Ayanokouji-kun. You’ve given up on getting a cake for today, right?”

</p><p>“Hm? Yeah, that’s my intention. Since I came all this way though, I want to——”

</p><p>“I wouldn’t recommend convenience store sweets right now. They’re low quality at this time of year.” 

</p><p>She cut me off and gave me some good advice.

</p><p>“I would recommend just leaving and trying again next year. You’d be a pretty unfortunate person if you compromise here.”

</p><p>It’s only a cake. I feel that it’s up to the individual to decide when and where to eat one, but I’m losing my desire to do so.

</p><p>“...I guess that would be the best thing to do.”

</p><p>I don’t want to force myself to buy a cake now and be labelled as an unfortunate person by Sakayanagi.
