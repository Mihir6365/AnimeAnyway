    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        After that, Shiranami and I started walking while I thought about a few places.
    </p>
    <p>It would be hard to go to the roof in school, since it’s raining and the weather’s
        pretty bad.
    </p>
    <p>Still, there are a lot of students around inside the buildings.
    </p>
    <p>The one saving grace is that Shiranami seems very keen on avoiding me.
    </p>
    <p>In most cases like this, you would walk one or two steps apart even if you
        aren’t close with each other, but Shiranami is walking at quite a distance
        behind me.
    </p>
    <p>You probably wouldn’t think we were together if you looked at us from the
        side.
    </p>
    <p>So, even though it’s Christmas Eve, I don’t think I need to worry about us
        being mistaken as a couple.
    </p>
    <p>“...What?”</p>
    <p>
        “It’s nothing.”</p>
    <p>
        I feel like Shiranami’s going to go even further back if I pay too much attention
        to her.
    </p>
    <p>It’s not like I invited her, but she still looks worried.
    </p>
    <p>Still, I’m the one that started chatting with her, so I suppose I have no choice.
    </p>
    <p>Wandering around aimlessly, we arrived at a resting area.
    </p>
    <p>It’s an area with a few vending machines and two benches without backrests.
    </p>
    <p>I knew that there were surprisingly few students utilizing this place, and today
        is no exception either as I don’t see anyone else here.
    </p>
    <p>“Do you want something to drink?”</p>
    <p>
        “I don’t think so.”</p>
    <p>
        “Shall we sit on a———”</p>
    <p>
        “No, it’s okay.”</p>
    <p>
        I was turned down in a row and gave up.
    </p>
    <p>“Can I ask what you wanted to talk about?”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami stood facing me at some distance and started fidgeting with her
        hands.
    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokoji-kun… Umm… What’s your relationship with Honami-chan?”</p>
    <p>
        “What do you mean?”</p>
    <p>
        “Just classmates? Friends? Or… Something more than that?”</p>
    <p>
        Her words are indistinct, but they make her question very clear.
    </p>
    <p>It seems that my reply will be very important for Shiranami.
    </p>
    <p>I know why, of course.
    </p>
    <p>It was one of the events that originally led me to building a relationship with
        Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>Last year, just a few days after I enrolled, Ichinose was confessed to by
        Shiranami right in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike a normal friend, she felt feelings of love towards her like the opposite
        gender.
    </p>
    <p>No, that expression isn’t accurate.
    </p>
    <p>In our current age, it’s a mistake to make an issue of whether the genders are
        the same or opposite.
    </p>
    <p>Shiranami, as a person, has feelings towards Ichinose as another person.
    </p>
    <p>That’s all there is to it.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, she doesn’t like the fact that Ichinose likes me.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a very simple and easy to understand diagram.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m wondering what the right answer would be. I’m a bit confused, but…”</p>
    <p>
        “Don’t hold yourself back for my sake, just answer.”</p>
    <p>
        “I’m not holding back. It’s just a little hard to judge if I can call her my friend.”</p>
    <p>
        “...What does that mean?”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami raised her eyebrows with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>“I have very few friends. I don’t really understand what a friend is that well in
        the first place. You wouldn’t call someone a friend just because you talk to
        them, right? Where’s the line between an acquaintance and a friend?”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s, hmm, I wouldn’t really know the answer to that…”</p>
    <p>
        “Me neither. From my point of view, I think that we have a friendly
        relationship.”</p>
    <p>
        “I don’t really get it… Are you deliberately trying to evade the question?”</p>
    <p>
        That’s not my intention at all, as I meant to give a serious answer.
    </p>
    <p>“You’re just friends then, right? I can say that you don’t, umm, have any
        feelings like love towards each other, right?”</p>
    <p>
        I never asked Shiranami directly, but I don’t think she doesn’t know Ichinose’s
        feelings.
    </p>
    <p>She said ‘towards each other’, but I’m sure what she really wants to know is
        how I feel.
    </p>
    <p>“Of course you don’t, right? I mean, you’re dating Karuizawa-san, so.”</p>
    <p>
        She couldn’t wait for my answer and added onto her question.
    </p>
    <p>“Does it matter if I have a girlfriend or not? For my answer about my feelings
        towards Ichinose.”</p>
    <p>
        “Of course it does. I mean, you’d only fall in love with one person.”</p>
    <p>
        She came back with a romantic, rather, pure reply.
    </p>
    <p>She believes this with all certainty without doubt.
    </p>
    <p>“Don’t some people see more than one person at the same time as an object
        of love?”</p>
    <p>
        Unrelated to gender, I can definitely think of a case like this.
    </p>
    <p>“N-No!”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami however strongly denied it.
    </p>
    <p>I can tell she’s angry from the fact that she’s squeezing her small hand.
    </p>
    <p>“Sorry. That was unrelated to this matter. There’s nothing you should be
        worried about between Ichinose and me right now.”</p>
    <p>
        “...Right now?”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami, obviously sensitive to each and every one of my words, picked up
        the word I said as insurance just to make sure.
    </p>
    <p>“No one knows what will happen in the future.”</p>
    <p>
        “Still, if you had a normal relationship, I don’t think you’d add the ‘now’...”</p>
    <p>
        She may be right about that.
    </p>
    <p>If this was about a girl like Amikura instead of Ichinose, I may not have said
        ‘for now’ as insurance.
    </p>
    <p>I could have clearly said that she is just a friend, nothing more or nothing less.
    </p>
    <p>“Even if… Even if Honami-chan likes you, you wouldn’t have added the ‘right
        now’ if you didn’t have any feelings towards her… Those words wouldn’t have
        come out if you weren’t planning on breaking up with Karuizawa-san and
        dating Honami-chan.”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami managed to find the words she probably didn’t want to say.
    </p>
    <p>It takes courage to say these words, even though they are uttered by
        someone that is probably at my nose level.
    </p>
    <p>“I think that it’s okay for Honami-chan to, err, fall in love with anyone she
        wants…. But I’m not gonna stay quiet if she starts dating someone who’s
        dishonest.”</p>
    <p>
        “Do you become a dishonest person if you date and break up with someone
        once?”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s… No, but…”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose’s classmate Shiranami can’t talk about Ichinose’s situation.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that she had already felt the changes, but that doesn’t seem to be
        the case.
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose’s new face.
    </p>
    <p>I really don’t want any unintentional influence from me until I figure out how
        the new Ichinose functions.
    </p>
    <p>So, even if it was going to cast a shadow inside Shiranami’s mind, I had no
        choice but to add in the ‘now’ and be noncommittal.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m not trying to worry you, but as long as there is the possibility that you will
        not accept it calmly, no matter what I say, I can’t help but add an insurance
        and be roundabout.”</p>
    <p>
        This may be a little stern, but it’s best that I convey things clearly.
    </p>
    <p>She had an expression that said ‘that’s not true’ for a moment, then thankfully
        seemed to notice that her passion had reached heights she was not
        expecting.
    </p>
    <p>“...I’m sorry. I think I said way too much…”</p>
    <p>
        She was so desperate that she forgot how far she was going.
    </p>
    <p>That’s all.
    </p>
    <p>“You really worry about Ichinose, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        It’s normal for her to be worried for her as a friend, and as someone whom she
        holds feelings for.
    </p>
    <p>“U-Umm… I’m, I’m really sorry!”</p>
    <p>
        She gravely accepted her blunder and started calming down.
    </p>
    <p>“I’ve just been hearing a lot of rumours about you two lately…”</p>
    <p>
        “Rumours are rumours.”</p>
    <p>
        “Yeah… I heard you were going to the gym together while ignoring your
        studies, or that you let her into your room even though you have a girlfriend…
        I can’t believe people are spreading such untruthful rumours…”</p>
    <p>
        Hm… Hmm?
    </p>
    <p>“W-What is it? Why do you look so weird and stiff all of a sudden?”</p>
    <p>
        “I’m just wondering where such untruthful rumours, no, trivial truths are
        spreading from.”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s a weird way of being roundabout. Rumours and truths are unrelated,
        aren’t they?”</p>
    <p>
        “In many cases, yes.”</p>
    <p>
        “...Huh?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm?”</p>
    <p>
        “You haven’t been going to the gym with her… Right?”</p>
    <p>
        “No. I just happened to start going to the gym. I can run into her by
        coincidence there, can’t I?”</p>
    <p>
        Just like today.
    </p>
    <p>I got contacted by her before, but it’s not like we met in the gym on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>“I guess that’s right. Mako-chan goes to the gym too, but that thing about you
        letting her into your room… That’s definitely just an underhanded rumour,
        right?”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s right. I haven’t been calling Ichinose and inviting her into my room.”</p>
    <p>
        Something like that happened three times with Ichinose, but the first time was
        in the midst of the Class Voting Special Test.
    </p>
    <p>The second time was that rainy day at the end of the school year.
    </p>
    <p>The third one was recent, but that was just because Ichinose waited outside
        my room of her own initiative.
    </p>
    <p>I suppose someone saw her waiting there the third time.
    </p>
    <p>“...I’m gonna believe you.”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami said with some hesitation as she finally had a positive expression.
    </p>
    <p>The problem is, depending on how she receives things in the future, she might
        think that she was betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps I should supplement just to be safe.
    </p>
    <p>However, I would cast a shadow over her heart again if I clumsily say
        something that sounds like an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>“Can I say one thing?”</p>
    <p>
        “M-Mhm. What is it?”</p>
    <p>
        “No matter who Ichinose ends up loving, or who she loves now, it’s not as if
        your value is going down. That might change if you do something that Ichinos
        wouldn’t want, though. You know what I’m trying to say, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “...Mhm.”</p>
    <p class="italic">
        I can’t be with the person I love. I don’t like it, so I’m going to interfere with her.
    </p>
    <p>If the person she loves sees that kind of thinking, she’s obviously not going to
        like it.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m a pretty unpleasant girl, aren’t I?”</p>
    <p>
        I suppose she started remembering the things she said today after calming
        down.
    </p>
    <p>“I said nothing but complaints to you, almost like I was taking my anger out on
        you…”</p>
    <p>
        I felt that the whole time as well after she said that she’d like to change
        location and chat.
    </p>
    <p>Still, even leaving out the part where I’m the one who startled her, I never had
        any intention of reproaching her.
    </p>
    <p>“Despite you helping me when I got lost at the Uninhabited Island Test that
        summer…”</p>
    <p>
        Ever since Shiranami enrolled in this school, she’s always held special
        feelings towards Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>I can understand why she would half-unconsciously harbour resentment
        towards someone like me.
    </p>
    <p>“I don’t mind. I’m the one who bothered you, and I should apologize for
        sounding like I was lectur———”</p>
    <p>
        “I’m really sorry!”</p>
    <p>
        Before I could finish my apology, Shiranami returned it back instead.
    </p>
    <p>“Umm, err, it’s not as if I hate you… I really don't.”</p>
    <p>
        I already know all that, but Shiranami doesn’t, so she started explaining for her
        own sake.
    </p>
    <p>She’s not going to be convinced if I interrupt her, so I suppose I should just be
        the listener for a while.
    </p>
    <p>After that, Shiranami continued apologizing while spreading the conversation
        in all directions with 80% apology and 20% explanation.
    </p>
    <p></p>
