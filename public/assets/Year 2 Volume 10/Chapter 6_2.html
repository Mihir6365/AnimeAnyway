    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        The Special Test of Survival and Elimination began as the 1st turn slowly progressed.

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen took the first attack from the Ichinose Class, and after only 1 of their protections succeeded, one
        certainly can’t say they’re off to a good start after no student correctly solved a problem.

    </p>
    <p>It’s no surprise, though.

    </p>
    <p>There are a lot of students that have to be protected from academic ability problems in Ryuen’s class, and they
        have clear weak points.

    </p>
    <p>Even excluding the students who excluded ‘Economy’, which Ichinose chose, most of the students all feel uneasy
        about the same genre.

    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, the Ichinose Class’s results after being attacked by the Horikita Class is 4 points total.

    </p>
    <p>A score difference was quickly created from turn 1, and things felt gloomy after that.

    </p>
    <p>However, that’s not because they couldn’t earn points.

    </p>
    <p>“Alright then, so we’re going to name our targets from Class-A as the attacker next.”

    </p>
    <p>Hoshinomiya nonchalantly called out to the leader, but Ryuen didn’t make any moves.

    </p>
    <p>He quietly continued staring at his phone.

    </p>
    <p>“Hello? Can you hear me?”

    </p>
    <p>She called out to him again from the teacher’s desk, but Ryuen still didn’t move.

    </p>
    <p>As was made clear by the explanation beforehand, the naming time doesn’t pause and instead continues going by
        second by second.

    </p>
    <p>Hoshinomiya obviously thought Ryuen would decide who to attack on turn 1, but even after 60 seconds passed, Ryuen
        still didn’t make a move.

    </p>
    <p>Normally, someone would call out and ask if he was okay, but none of his classmates pointed this out.

    </p>
    <p>No, most people in this class couldn’t point it out even if they wanted to.

    </p>
    <p>Since his return to the frontlines,

        Ryuen had been more dominant and intimidating than even before.

    </p>
    <p>It’s rare for Hoshinomiya to see the Ryuen Class tensed up like this, but not so for the students.

    </p>
    <p>This is just a regular daily scene.

    </p>
    <p>Things would move quickly if Kaneda, who has the advisor role, would make a move instead, but no one can expect
        him to do anything without Ryuen’s instruction first.

    </p>
    <p>At times like this, the confused students usually look to Katsuragi for directions.

    </p>
    <p>He is a transfer from another class, but he is already being recognized as Ryuen’s advisor in this class.

    </p>
    <p>While his overall ability displayed on the OAA is a factor, the biggest one is his unfearing attitude towards
        Ryuen.

    </p>
    <p>Ibuki has a proud attitude too, but there is an actual basis for it in Katsuragi’s case.

    </p>
    <p>So, Katsuragi, who the class would rely on… isn’t moving.

    </p>
    <p>He’s just allowing the time limit for the attacker to pass by with his arms crossed and eyes closed.

    </p>
    <p>Maybe he’s already given up, believing that there is no point in talking to Ryuen anyway.

    </p>
    <p>Or perhaps he’s comfortably waiting as this situation was already within his expectations.

    </p>
    <p>At any rate, most students can do nothing but keep quiet and watch.

    </p>
    <p>“Umm, it’s still turn 1, right? A 3 point difference isn’t that big of a deal, so maybe it’s best we don’t get
        hasty?”

    </p>
    <p>Hoshinomiya tried to encourage the class, emphasizing that this is only turn 1.

    </p>
    <p>Her move was somewhat lacking in impartiality as a teacher, but she still couldn’t stay quiet while seeing how
        distressed the students were.

    </p>
    <p>That’s the assumption.

    </p>
    <p>The real reason is that in order for the Ichinose Class to win, she couldn’t allow the Sakayanagi Class to earn
        any points.

    </p>
    <p>She will have no chance to win if they continually score because of a foolish strategy.

    </p>
    <p>So it was a calculated act, and Hoshinomiya realized her decision was wrong as the silence continued.

    </p>
    <p>While many students do feel doubts about the fact that Ryuen isn’t making a move, most of them didn’t feel
        distressed because of it.

    </p>
    <p>Silence usually tends to be a bad result, but this is the unique strength cultivated in this class.

    </p>
    <p>They’re accepting this strange situation of the leader not naming any targets even after 2 minutes have passed.

    </p>
    <p>Maybe there is a secret strategy behind that silence.

    </p>
    <p>That’s what Hoshinomiya started thinking about.

    </p>
    <p>Does he have some fantastical strategy in mind that she missed?

    </p>
    <p>When the remaining time reached around 30 seconds, Ryuen conveyed his 5 targets.

    </p>
    <p>“H-Hey, wait, wait. Let me put them in.”

    </p>
    <p>Hoshinomiya quickly typed on her tablet.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">Genre: </p>
    <p class="italic">Life, difficulty 1.

    </p>
    <p class="bold">Attacker Targets: </p>
    <p class="italic">Kitou Hayato, Kamuro Masumi, Hashimoto Masayoshi, Machida Kouji, Yamamura Miki.



    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>Hoshinomiya quickly finished typing, and looked at the 5 names in astonishment.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <p class="bold">Successful Protections: </p>
    <p class="italic">Machida Kouji.
    </p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>As a result of such a long time of consideration, 1 person was protected.
    </p>
    <p>The problem comes after that, however.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">Correct Solvers: </p><p class="italic">

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>3 students out of the 4 that remained answered correctly.

    </p>
    <p>Giving the opponent 4 points and stopping at 1 point for themselves is a bad start.

    </p>
    <p>He cannot be relied on, after all.

    </p>
    <p>The students who remained surprisingly calm were ready to be impressed, but that feeling quickly erased from
        their minds.

    </p>
    <p>They realized that they do not have the ability to crush the Sakayanagi Class, after all.

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen’s strategies were nothing to compliment after that either.

    </p>
    <p>Most of his picks remained the same as they were on turn 1.

    </p>
    <p>Although he occasionally switched them around as diversion, he continued targeting Kitou, Kamuro, Hashimoto,
        Yamamura, Machida, Sanada, and Satonaka.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, Sakayanagi also continued protecting them with good efficiency, but Ryuen still didn’t change his
        picks.

    </p>
    <p>He continued through every turn while staying at the bottom ranking.

    </p>
    <p>However, at turn 5 after the halfway point, Hoshinomiya noticed something unresolvable as the students who should
        start panicking after getting 2 wrong started to show up.

    </p>
    <p>“None of you seem to be disturbed, huh..?”

    </p>
    <p>The critical factor in being the last place unable to escape has more to do with defense than offense.

    </p>
    <p>The class is clearly solving problems at a lower rate than the others, and it hasn’t earned the points it needs
        to win.

    </p>
    <p>Normally, they should now be spending every single second to frantically look for some hints that could give them
        the answers.

    </p>
    <p>However, many of the students were not looking disturbed.

    </p>
    <p>Hoshinomiya walked around the class, pretending to watch over the students, and nonchalantly peeked at each
        student’s cell phone.

    </p>
    <p>They weren’t playing games, and instead they were looking at all kinds of sites and videos to find some way to
        deal with the genres that are their weak points.

    </p>
    <p>Maybe they’re just too nervous to speak up because of how dominating Ryuen is?

    </p>
    <p>That could be it too, but…

        “Kaneda-kun, it doesn’t look like you’re doing anything but do you actually have a plan?”

    </p>
    <p>Hoshinomiya asked Kaneda, who is not even touching his cell phone unlike the other students.

    </p>
    <p>“I know I don’t look like it, but I actually study all the time. I just don’t want to try and force anything more
        into my head at the last second. I don’t like my routine being disturbed.”

    </p>
    <p>Kaneda pushed his glasses up and boldly smiled.

    </p>
    <p>“O-Oh. The smart ones are always weirder, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>Hoshinomiya looked a little creeped out and lost interest in Kaneda.

    </p>
    <p>Other than that, Ishizaki also had the audacity to doze off during the waiting period.

    </p>
    <p>He looked to have given up after already answering 2 questions incorrectly.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s going on in this class..?”

    </p>
    <p>She continued on through each turn as the teacher in charge while seeming a bit uncomfortable.
