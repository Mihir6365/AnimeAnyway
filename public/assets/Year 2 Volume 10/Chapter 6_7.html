Don’t worry about that, and stay calm.”</p><p>Even if they already knew, more than a few students did feel worried.</p><p>That’s precisely why Ichinose spoke, to grant her allies relief.</p><p>Her words really were true, of course. </p><p>However, if she fought in the same way as before and fell behind, the other classes would mercilessly use this gap to attack her.</p><p>The most important point is to keep the number of eliminated students at 0. </p><p>She was preparing in advance for the unlikely scenario that her class lost.</p><p>If there are no eliminated students, the class could avoid expulsions even if they ended up in last place. </p><p>This is her style of protection.</p><p>Of course, she didn’t abandon the idea of winning.</p><p>How can she protect her classmates while also trying to win, then? </p><p>By not fighting on the opponent’s terms, but rather dragging them into hers.</p><p>Her opponents saw this and assumed that defense is the priority for her.</p><p>In the second half, Horikita’s aim became clear after the 2nd and 3rd turns.</p><p>To force numerous students to answer two questions incorrectly, and increase the number of students at risk of elimination.</p><p>She wanted to see what Ichinose would do when this number reached 5.</p><p>“Thank you, Horikita-san.” <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 10/Images/image7.webp" alt=""></p><p>Ichinose was grateful for Horikita’s wise but merciful actions.</p><p>As long as she could score points, she did not care about eliminating students from her opponents.</p><p>This is what Ichinose preferred.</p><p>Facing Horikita, who attacks in a solid manner instead of Ryuen’s irregular methods, Ichinose continued using her protection slots to defend her students.</p><p>“I won’t abandon anyone. Will you trust me?” </p><p>She doesn’t want to hurt her allies.</p><p>She welcomes her opponent with open arms, in order to prevent them from making an impulsive move.</p><p>“I just hope that this ends without anyone from the class, from our grade, no, from the school being expelled.”</p><p>Her feelings are true.</p><p>However, there are sacrifices that need to be made in order to avoid casualties from the class.</p><p>That’s why she did not hesitate to eliminate students from the Ryuen Class.</p><p>She has to force the other classes to sink down, so that she can win.</p><p>As a result, by the time the first half came to an end, 4 students were eliminated from the Ryueen Class because of Ichinose’s attacks.</p><p>If someone among them is expelled in the end, then it will be Ichinose who indirectly caused them to be expelled.</p><p>A necessary sacrifice. </p><p>Those who are heartbroken about this still have no choice but to go through with it.</p><p>But, that’s only in case Ryuen loses.</p><p>“The second half will start in 1 minute. Take your seats and get ready.” </p><p>Ichinose opened her phone after Mashima-sensei’s signal. </p><p>Then, she slowly went up her chat history to check her conversation with a certain person. </p><p>It had taken place directly after the first half started.</p><p>“Ryuen-kun, I know this is sudden, but would you like to team up with me? I don’t want anyone to be expelled from my class. For that, I have to end the special test with 0 eliminations. So, I want you to make sure that you don’t eliminate anyone from my class in the second half.” </p><p>Ichinose had sent that message to Ryuen directly after the special test started.</p><p>Her message was read without a delay, and a reply came back.</p><p>“That’s a pretty selfish request. You really think I’m just gonna do what you want?”</p><p>“I think we can negotiate. I’ll give you a present that will make you happy.”</p><p>“Before that, are you telling me you can get through Suzune’s attacks unscathed?”</p><p>There would be no point in asking Ryuen to avoid eliminating anyone unless she got through 10 turns in the first half with 0 eliminations.</p><p>“I can.”</p><p>“That’s a quick reply. You didn’t negotiate with her before me, did you? That would change things.”</p><p>A clumsy lie wouldn’t work on someone as cautious as Ryueen. </p><p>Of course, Ichinose never had any intention of negotiating with Horikita. </p><p>The negotiations may come to naught, and on top of that, the Sakayanagi Class will also make their moves. </p><p>That’s a development Ichinose must avoid.</p><p>“I want to protect everyone, I don’t want any eliminations. I’m sure she knows how I feel about that already. So, I’m sure Horikita’s first aim will be to put 5 students at risk of elimination. She’ll want to check if I will continue to protect those 5 students or not.”</p><p>If she doesn’t protect anyone out of the 5 students, that would mean Ichinose is prepared to have eliminations in her class, or even an expulsion if she ends up losing. </p><p>But if she does protect them, then that will make things a lot easier for Horikita. </p><p>Ichinose’s 5 precious protection slots will all be used on the 5 students. </p><p>After that, Horikita will change her policy and target the students who haven’t made any mistakes yet.</p><p>“Unlike you or Sakayanagi-san, all Horikita-san cares about is to win, not to expel students from other classes. She will attack the 34 unprotected students in a balanced way.” </p><p>Ichinose’s role in the first half was to use the protection slots at her disposal to allow 5 students who feel uneasy about the assignment to escape by taking advantage of the protections.</p><p>“If your strategy goes well, then you’re right that you will have 0 eliminations if I do what you ask in the second half. That’s a big ask though, ain’t it? What’s my present?”</p><p>“A guarantee of 25 points. For 5 turns out of the 10 turns we will attack, I will tell you our targets. I will spread them around so that the other classes don’t realize what we’re doing, of course.”</p><p>Ryuen could get a good position in the special test just by being told which students will be attacked.</p><p>Ichinose’s message was instantly read, but there was no reply for 3 minutes while Ryuen thought about it.</p><p>“Nah. It doesn’t sound bad, but I have my own ideas.”</p><p>“I see. That’s a shame.”</p><p>Ichinose thought she made a good offer, but she had to accept that it wouldn't work out. </p><p>If she conceded any more points, she’d lose any hope for first place. </p><p>Most of all, Ryueen didn’t even try to negotiate for more points anyhow. </p><p>“Well, I guess I’ll have to be thorough, then…” </p><p>The negotiations broke down. Ichinose could think of many ways to make this worse, but she won’t do that.</p><p>Her only choice is to use her own abilities to aim for 0 eliminations. </p><p>However…“You’re in luck.”</p><p>Just as Ichinose thought her hopes were dashed, Ryuen sent another message.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“If you make sure that there won’t be any eliminations in the first half, I’ll agree to half of what you ask.”</p><p>“Half?”</p><p>“I’m saying I’ll agree on not causing any eliminations. But about that 25 points guarantee, I don’t need it. Sakayanagi will notice something’s going on if we do anything strange in the first half.” </p><p>“What do you want from me, then?”</p><p>“When the attackers and defenders are switched around in the second half, you will score points from me as necessary. I’m not gonna explain why. It’s up to you whether you want to believe me or not.” </p><p>A strange proposal to become the side taking the points instead of giving them away.</p><p>If it was any other student, one would think it was an absurd offer that will never be held up.</p><p>“...I see…”</p><p>Ichinose quietly muttered.</p><p>This time, Ichinose started thinking.</p><p>About whether she can believe Ryuen or not. </p><p>She took her time, and it would be a lie to say she wasn’t hesitant. </p><p>However, Ichinose still answered in under 1 minute. </p><p>“Okay, I believe you.”</p><p>No other student could imitate the speed of her decision.</p><p>This isn’t just because she is a friendly person.</p><p>This is Ichinose’s logic, her thinking. </p><p>She guessed what Ryuen’s aim was and decided to believe he would hold up his end of the deal.</p><p>Her message was instantly read after she sent it.</p><p>It is also possible that Ryuen was trying to contact Ichinose in the same way too.</p><p>In other words, even if it was for an entirely different reason, Ryuen also wanted to team up with her.</p><p>This was their exchange before the special test’s beginning.</p><p>From the second half, the situation greatly changed throughout the Second Half (From Turn 11) until turn 14.</p><p>Turn 15, the Sakayanagi Class’s attack on the Ryuen Class. </p><p>The results were displayed, and it was a perfect protection again. </p><p>Ichinose saw this and secretly smiled. </p><p>“Impressive. So this is what you were trying to do.” </p><p>“I’ll let you survive, so just keep quiet about this.” </p><p>“You agreed with me, even though you didn’t even need to team up with me. Thanks.”</p><p>“You think I agreed out of the kindness of my heart? There’s no advantage for me in you being in last place. I just took control of the scoring as necessary.” </p><p>Indeed, Ryuen’s term in the negotiation was for Ichinose to take points from him. </p><p>In other words, if she was about to lose to the Sakayanagi Class, she could simply increase her score and take 3rd place or above by force.</p><p>Ichinose foresaw the results of this special test and felt relieved that she would not lose any allies. </p><p>Immediately after the special test was announced, she had not made the choice of distributing the protection slots, out of fear of it sparking a dispute in the Unanimous Special Test. </p><p>She almost regretted that. </p><p>Then…Currently, Karuizawa Kei has one wrong answer. </p><p>She will be in risk of elimination if she gets one more problem wrong. </p><p>It’s still possible for Class-B to fall down to last place. </p><p>Among the students who were already eliminated, there are those who are lower in the pecking order than Karuizawa, so she can’t have high hopes of eliminating her. </p><p>Still, there is a chance.</p><p>However, for that, she must first break the consecutive nominations.</p><p>“No… That’s a bad way to do it…”</p><p>Ichinose told herself that she needs to act for her class, instead of out of her own emotions.</p><p>Ayanokoji won’t reject her. </p><p>He accepts Ichinose, even while continuing his relationship with Karuizawa. </p><p>As such, there is also a way for her to simultaneously continue and overwrite everything herself.</p><p>She was reminded that she is a lousy human being, but she didn’t mind.</p><p>“The way for us to win even if we don’t get first place, is to force Sakayanagi-san to take last place.”</p><p>Ichinose controlled her breathing during her limited time.</p><p>Then, she looked at her phone.</p><p>The meaning behind her continuing to target Karuizawa despite her being protected.</p><p>It should be all too clear by now.</p><p>Ichinose restrained herself and concentrated.</p><p>“I would like to nominate Karuizawa Kei-san.”</p><p>She gave Karuizawa’s name again in turn 16. </p><p>Ichinose had a newfound resolve and would not hesitate.</p><p>This is good enough for now.</p><p>All she has to do afterwards is to repeat this.</p><p>“I would like to nominate Karuizawa Kei-san.” </p><p>Ichinose clutched her phone, believing that she would be the real winner of this special test.</p></div>
