    <h1>Epilogue</h1>
    <h2>A New Expulsion
    </h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3><p>
Sakayanagi’s first attack in the second half.

</p><p>Her target is now the Ryuen Class instead of the Horikita Class. 

</p><p>She hasn’t established any particular policy when fighting the Ryuen Class before the special test.

</p><p>That’s because she believed it would be pointless to think about a strategy against such an opponent.

</p><p>However, Sakayanagi currently has some extra information.

</p><p>The phone call last night from her classmate Hashimoto, when he gave her some firm advice

A few things remained in Sakayanagi’s mind after hearing about various things.

</p><p>One of them is the idea that she should eliminate Shiina Hiyori, and look into the possibility of expelling her.

</p><p>Sakayanagi never cared about Hashimoto’s personal opinions, but she hesitated after hearing his reason.

</p><p>Ayanokoji’s way of looking at Shiina, and his demeanor towards her.

</p><p>Hashimoto said that it was different compared to other students.

</p><p>This remark drew Sakayanagi’s interest.

</p><p>Would Ayanokoji show some emotion if she managed to get Shiina expelled?

</p><p>“It’s already too late for that, though.”

</p><p>During the first half, Ichinose’s way of fighting displayed a stronger willpower than usual. 

</p><p>Normally, she would even hesitate to eliminate students from the Ryuen Class, despite him being her opponent. 

</p><p>However, Ichinose showed no hesitation when the lid was opened. 

</p><p>She eliminated Ishizaki, Isoyama, Yano, and Morofuji during the first half alone.

</p><p>She wanted to protect her own classmates, no matter what.

</p><p>For that, she was ready to show no mercy to outsiders.

</p><p>Even if Sakayanagi succeeded in targeting and dropping Shiina from now on, the student to be sacrificed would still turn out to be someone else.

</p><p>Trying to expel Shiina with a low chance of success would only lower Sakayanagi’s efficiency.

</p><p>Currently, Shiina only has one mistake. 

</p><p>Even if Sakayanagi could force her to make another mistake by attacking with an assignment Shiina cannot solve, it would still be difficult to avoid a protection. 

</p><p>Sakayanagi had to think about what to do.

</p><p>“Interesting…”

</p><p>It was a boring special test after she got through the first half in 1st place. 

</p><p>She wanted some play.

</p><p>She changed her decision and thought that it would be interesting to try and drop someone who made for an especially difficult target.

</p><p>After getting through this difficulty, she would also naturally keep 1st place and finish the game.

</p><p>What kind of strategy should she form in order to do this?

</p><p>She solidified her policy during the few minutes it took for her turn to come.

</p><p>Then, her turn to attack finally came with turn 11.

</p><p>Even so…

In the Second Half (From Turn 11) , every student Sakayanagi named got protected.

</p><p>She had to spend 2 points in order to try and evade the protection slots. It was a complete backfire.

</p><p>But all the students started talking about how there's no need to worry about fair play.

</p><p>However, Sakayanagi was wrong.

</p><p>Just one perfect score. 

</p><p>However, successfully doing something of such low probability doesn’t look like luck alone.

</p><p>She threw strategy and theory away, and chose her targets at completely random.

</p><p>The result was the same as the Turn 11; a perfect score. 

</p><p>A miracle happening for the second time.

</p><p>Her classmates could also no longer hide their confusion.

</p><p>An average person might think that their tactics were predicted and that they lost on a strategic level, but this idea didn’t even exist in Sakayanagi’s mind.

</p><p>There’s someone behind this. 

</p><p>She had only one answer in her mind, but she could only confirm it during turn 2.

</p><p>There is a traitorous Judas in this class, she thought. 

</p><p>There is clearly an information leakage.

</p><p>What’s happening right now could not be explained otherwise. 

</p><p>Sakayanagi decided to observe her classmates without a word until the next turn.

</p><p>The students looked at each other, lamenting Ryuen’s fortunes. 

</p><p>Some fiddled with their phones, trying to avoid being eliminated.

</p><p>Then, turn 13’s attack.

</p><p>In this moment alone, the class became completely quiet.

</p><p>Sakayanagi kept silent. 

</p><p>30 seconds passed, then a minute, but she didn’t name her targets.

</p><p>It’s not that she’s trying to keep her wits about finding a way to stop Ryuen.

</p><p>This silence is a quiet order from her to her classmates.

</p><p>A hidden message, ‘Stop playing with fire.’

Sakayanagi broke her silence at the last moment and told her nominations to Chabashira-sensei.

</p><p>However, the result was a perfect protection again.

</p><p>“What a shame.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi muttered to herself, and her smile weakened after three consecutive failures. 

</p><p>She couldn’t do much while information was being leaked in real time.

</p><p>Someone is using a chat app or e-mails to send the names of Sakayanagi’s targets. 

</p><p>A student typing on their phone by itself was not a suspicious move, as they were using their phones to gather information. 

</p><p>The other possibility is a phone call. 

</p><p>This way, the information could be leaked in real time without typing as Sakayanagi informed the teacher of her targets.

</p><p>Sakayanagi could ask the teacher for permission to inform her by writing on a piece of paper. 

</p><p>Even if this wasn’t allowed, she could stop a voice-based information leakage by whispering to her instead.

</p><p>However…

She looked at the big monitor positioned right behind her.

</p><p>Even if she made sure no one heard her, a phone camera could still be used instead.

</p><p>The only defense would be to make it physically impossible to send information.

</p><p>She could stop all the students from using their phones and tablets.

</p><p>Then, she could whisper to the teacher, and make all the students turn around while Ryuen picked who to protect, and shut down the flow of information.

</p><p>It would be satisfactory if this solved the problem.

</p><p>She had only conceded 15 points, so she could still stop Ryuen’s rampage.

</p><p>“There’s an information leakage.”

</p><p>The student who broke the silence was Morishita Ai.

</p><p>She muttered with an expressionless face.

</p><p>“You might be right, Morishita-san. I think everybody should stop using their phones. Ryuen might be playing a trick on us.”

</p><p>After a short delay, Sanada also called Sakayanagi to action while agreeing with Morishita.

</p><p>Kitou and Hashimoto immediately stood up.

</p><p>“There is no need to do anything.”

</p><p>“B-But..!”

</p><p>“We should keep using our phones to look for hints that can help us solve the problems.”

</p><p>It would be difficult to say that trying to learn at the last moment would be helpful under the circumstances.

</p><p>An unexpected order from the leader to not do what needs to be done.

</p><p>“Are you sure, Hime-san? After seeing three consecutive perfect protections, I’m also sure that there is an information leakage, and that we must do something.”

</p><p>“There is not going to be any change of plans. Let’s continue the special test.”

</p><p>After that instruction, the other students could not push any further.

</p><p>Nobody had the right to make any changes to the plans.

</p><p>The students obeyed with doubts in their minds.

</p><p>Why is Sakayanagi not doing what needs to be done?

</p><p>It’s not so simple to betray the class. 

</p><p>It was only a matter of time until the class noticed the information leakage, as the opponent was so blatantly hitting the mark with their protections. 

</p><p>Seeing as they were doing this despite that, Sakayanagi was concerned about the possibility that this wasn't a problem that could simply be solved by taking away phones and stopping the students from seeing the monitor.

</p><p>What if the leakage doesn’t stop even after Sakayanagi takes action? 

</p><p>It’s easy to predict that on top of losing their way to gain information, the class will also fall into disarray.

</p><p>Even if by some luck Sakayanagi found proof, she knew that if she was the traitor, she would never have any proof of it on herself. 

</p><p>She would set up a device in a random student’s desk or bag, or somewhere in the classroom. 

</p><p>In that case, things would only come to a pointless argument. 

</p><p>The students would start arguing and blaming each other.

</p><p>With no hard evidence available, simply naming a student that is likely to be the Traitor is also a risk.

</p><p>In either case, creating a commotion now would be a drawback.

</p><p>Sakayanagi decided that it’s more important to try and avoid last place instead of grabbing first place.

</p><p>Because even the information leakage won’t have any effect on the class’s ability to defend and earn points.

</p><p>She tried to block Horikita’s attacks as much as possible and aim for 3rd place, but it didn’t go well.

</p><p>From what she could see on the monitor, it looked like Ichinose was assisting Horikita. 

</p><p>There was a strategy in play to utilize a traitor and drop Sakayanagi down to last place.

</p><p>If the trend continued, the special test would end at turn 20 with the class being defeated while 6 points short of 3rd place.

</p><p>“It looks like it’s my loss this time.”

</p><p>The failure of competing against every class and taking the last place. 

</p><p>Even including the leakage of information from the inside, there was no excuse to be made for this.

</p><p>Sakayanagi quietly sighed.

</p><p>She still needs to finish her responsibility as a leader for this defeat.

</p><p>“If we are defeated, we will have to expel someone from among us.”

</p><p>The 5 students who were eliminated during the special test are Kamuro, Yamamura, Sugio, Shiba and Machida.

</p><p>“Normally, that would be decided simply based on the student’s contributions to the class, but not this time. The reason is that, simply, from my point of view, all 5 students are on the same level.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi declared that there would be no change to the class’s fighting power, no matter who among the 5 was left out.

</p><p>“T-Then, how will you decide..?”

</p><p>One of the eliminated students, Machida, asked Sakayanagi with an anxious voice.

</p><p>“Shall we draw lots and fairly choose who will be going away?”

</p><p>The eliminated students groaned after that surprising proposal.

</p><p>“Do you disapprove? It’s unfortunate, but no matter who disappears, it won’t make much of a difference.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi quietly proceeded as the class fell silent. 

</p><p>The eliminated students wanted to complain, but nobody wanted to end up making themselves a target and be elected for expulsion.

</p><p>“It’s pointless to challenge me. The leader has the right to decide who is expelled.”

</p><p>“Are you saying obeying the results of a lottery is the leader’s decision?”

</p><p>“Of course. To make it easier to imagine, just like when a student with a low OAA takes responsibility, I’ve decided to consider the student with no luck as a student with no talent. Further, if anybody refuses to participate in the lottery, I will consider it as resigning from the fight and drop that student.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi quietly blocked the path of escape in order to force the students to participate.

</p><p>“I’ve made the lots.”

</p><p>A female student spoke up to Sakayanagi with a nonchalant voice, ignoring the heavy atmosphere.

</p><p>“That was quick, Morishita-san. Thanks for nicely colouring it too. Well, we’re short on time, so let’s finish this quickly.  Unfortunately, I will have the student who picks the coloured lot expelled.”

</p><p>5 lots in total, with 4 safe ones. That was all.

</p><p>“Who will start? Your chances won’t change, no matter who picks first or last.”

</p><p>Avoid expulsion with your own hands, or wait for someone else to be expelled.
</p><p>Machida held back the urge to refuse and pulled the first lot.

</p><p>“Yeah!!”

</p><p>Machida pulled a white lot and made a victory pose.

</p><p>Inspired by this, Sugio and Toba followed.

</p><p>There wasn’t any colour on the tip of the pieces of paper they pulled.

</p><p>Two students left. Kamurou Masumi and Yamamura Miki.

</p><p>The former just couldn’t be bothered to pull one yet.

</p><p>The other one was frozen up in fear. 

</p><p>The last two remained for entirely different reasons. 

</p><p>These two were more closely associated with Sakayanagi than the other three who were saved, but her expression remained unchanged.

</p><p>She chose a lottery of a fair ratio, because she decided that it doesn’t matter who goes away.

</p><p>“You can pull first.”

</p><p>Yamamura didn’t move even after Kamuro’s remark.

</p><p>She’s still trembling, not ready for the 1 in 2 possibility of being expelled.

</p><p>She can’t think about what comes after expulsion.

</p><p>She wanted to move, but her legs refused to do so.

</p><p>“I, I, I…”

</p><p>“Ugh, fine. I’ll pull first. Okay?” 

</p><p>Yamamura quietly nodded, barely stopping herself from refusing.

</p><p>Kamuro approached Morishita, who was holding the lots.

</p><p>“Please wait.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi spoke up before Kamuro reached out to the lots.

</p><p>“I said I would expel a student if they refused to pull. In other words, I will have the student who refused to pull, Yamamura, go away.”

</p><p>“Everyone’s fine with that, right?”

</p><p>“H-Huh..? W-Wait…”

</p><p>“What’s going on? Are you trying to save me?”

</p><p>“That isn’t it. I simply spoke the truth.”

</p><p>“Right. Yamamura and I should pull at the same time, then. Okay?”

</p><p>Sakayanagi tried to go ahead and decide the expulsion, but Kamuro is the one who stopped her.

</p><p>She flatly rejected the opportunity to avoid her own expulsion.

</p><p>“Come on already.”

</p><p>She approached Yamamura, who wasn’t moving one step, and pulled her by the arm towards the lots.

</p><p>“This is our first and last chance to see which one of us is luckier.”

</p><p>“How nice of you, Masumi-san. Was it necessary to face danger and save her when you should have abandoned her instead?”

</p><p>“Not really. I just wanted to do this.”

</p><p>“I see… Well then, let’s have you both pull at the same time.”

</p><p>Morishita offered the 2 lots forward.

</p><p>Kamuro pulled the indecisive Yamamura’s left hand closer, and she reflexively grabbed a lot.

</p><p>After seeing this, Kamuro also grabbed the other one.

</p><p>“No hard feelings, okay?”

</p><p>Kamuro, while awkwardly, gently said to Yamamura who was still agitated.

</p><p>“I’ll take my hand away, then.”

</p><p>Morishita slowly said, and opened her hand holding the lot at the same time. 

</p><p>Two pieces of paper, shaken by the slightest breeze. 

</p><p>The one who draws the coloured one is expelled from the school. 

</p><p>The one holding that paper at the tip of her fingers was Kamuro. 

</p><p>The other students did not accept the result right away, but were unable to speak up.

</p><p>“It’s decided. Good for you, Yamamura, you get to survive.”

</p><p>“Uh, what..?”

</p><p>Sakayanagi then gently tapped Yamamura on the shoulder, who still didn’t understand whether she was being expelled or not.

</p><p>Class-A, covered in silence.

</p><p>The situation is completely different compared to when Totsuka was expelled; a choice of reductions in class points and an expulsion due to defeat must be made.

</p><p>This is truly the first setback experienced by Class-A.

</p><p>The surprising thing is that Kamuro, who ended up being the one and only sacrifice, stayed calm throughout everything.

</p><p>Kamuro annoyedly brushed off her classmates’ gazes and returned to her seat.

</p><p>Sakayanagi looked away from her, asked the teacher in charge, Chabashira, to continue.

</p><p>“Well then, that concludes this special test.” 

</p><p>The Special Test of Survival and Elimination ended after taking up a long time.
