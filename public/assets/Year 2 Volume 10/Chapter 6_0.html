There’s nothing more I can do, so all that was left was to make sure my body is in an optimal condition.” </p><p>“Things were pretty bad when you got a fever at the first Uninhabited Island Test, weren’t they?” </p><p>“Shut up. I’ll stab you.” </p><p>“Sorry.” </p><p>I don’t understand why she’d stab me, but I’d still like to avoid that so I’ll apologize. </p><p>“Are you relaxed?” </p><p>“Not at all. In fact, I might be the one who’s going to cause trouble, so I should thank you in advance.” </p><p>At the least, I know that Sakayanagi or Ichinose will never target me using an assignment of academic ability. </p><p>“Sorry, but I’m never going to use a protection slot on you.” </p><p>“Never..?” </p><p>It’s an empty feeling to know at the start that I won’t be protected. </p><p>I think she’s half joking, but it’s best I don’t expect any support. </p><p>A short while after that, Chabashira-sensei confirmed that all students of the Horikita Class had gathered, and left after wishing us good luck for the battle. </p><p>The teacher who showed up right after Chabashira-sensei left is the homeroom teacher of the Ryuen Class, Sakagami-sensei. </p><p>“I’m Sakagami, I will be in charge of this class for this test. I’m going to tell you today’s attacking turns and the points of importance.” </p><p>After shortly saying so in a calm tone of voice, Sakagami-sensei stayed quiet. </p><p>He silently used his tablet to display the things of note on the monitor. </p><p></p><hr /><p class="bold">Special Test Configuration</p><p class="bold">(4) Class-A >(1) Class-B >(2) Class-C>(3) Class-D ></p><p class="bold">Points of Note</p><p class="italic">As a general rule, going to the toilet is only allowed during the 10 minute breaks after every 4 turns. </p><p class="italic">40 minute break after 40 turns (half the battle), with lunch included. </p><p class="italic">Free to use cellphones and whisper except during when the named students are solving problems. </p><p class="italic">Students who are unable to continue due to poor bodily condition will be treated as eliminees. </p><p class="italic">Any student caught cheating will be immediately eliminated and their points will be taken away. </p><hr /><p>There was new information included in the things of note, but there’s nothing to be surprised of here. </p><p>The named students cannot try to flee from attacks with fake illnesses, and there will be no time extensions. </p><p>That’s about it. </p><p>Since unlike normal written tests, the problems are different for each participant, so there won’t be any cases of hiding in the toilet and giving each other answers, and as such, pupils from different classes bumping into each other doesn’t pose a problem, and it doesn’t matter anyhow when everyone can use cellphones. </p><p>The positions of the displayed classes, and the attacking turns. These are the important points. </p><p>The first turn starts with Class-B, in other words, Horikita’s class, which attacks Ichinose’s Class-C. </p><p>Continuing, Ichinose will attack Ryuen’s Class-D, and Ryueen will attack Sakayanagi’s Class-A. </p><p>Finally, Sakayanagi’s Class-A will attack the Horikita Class and complete a turn, repeating for 10 turns. </p><p>This will be the half-way point, and then everything will be reversed in counter-clockwise order. </p><p>Horikita checked the attack turns by looking at the screen and then quickly looked at her cell phone. </p><p>At this point, all strategies that Horikita had planned against the Ryuen Class have become pointless. </p><p>She’s probably trying to come up with attack methods against the Ichinose Class and the Sakayanagi Class. </p><p>If I am to judge the situation on the front-face, having to fight the Ichinose Class which only does frontal attacks is a plus. </p><p>On the other hand, I can say that having to fight against Sakayanagi while the students are being drained because of her complete control of her class and sharp guessing, having to confront the Sakayanagi Class is a minus. </p><p>No matter what the result ends up being, I’m going to watch what happens as one of the participants. </p><p>No, I can’t be so leisurely. </p><p>I thought again about the 16 genres making up this Special Test. </p><p>Although it isn’t necessary to interpret an ‘elimination’ as an ‘expulsion’, it is rare for even me to bear a strong risk of expulsion after the Special Tests of the last two years. </p><p>I can with certainty overcome anything in the study department, but I’m honestly below average when it comes to genres like Subculture, Entertainment and such. </p><p>Even if I can exclude 3 of them beforehand, there is still a considerable risk of encountering a problem I cannot solve, so I can’t deny the possibility of me randomly ending up with an elimination. </p><p>Because the possibility of an unavoidable expulsion after Sakayanagi and Ichinose coordinating to eliminate me and make me go down to the last position is awaiting me. </p><p>“We’re beginning the Special Test, then. As explained before, this class, which is attacking on the first turn, will give me a genre and difficulty and choose five names.” </p><p>The signal to start the Special Test came from Sakagami-sensei. </p><p>We only have 3 minutes of time to use for one attack. </p><p>I can by no means say that we have extra time. </p><p>This isn’t the time to think about things, but to convey the results of our thinking. </p><p>It will take a long time to make guesses about the other class’s conduct, so using this time for discussion is the better way to go. </p><p>The only time to stop would be if we encountered a situation we could not predict. </p><p>“It’s a start where we can’t see left or right. Let’s go ahead like we talked about when we had that discussion with Hirata-kun.” </p><p>Horikita reached out to the main table after her affirmative remark. </p><p>I don’t have any information on what kind of policy we will go by while fighting, as I did not participate in the discussions. </p><p>The class has to verbally convey to the officer in charge the genre, the difficulty and the names. </p><p>Sakagami-sensei, noticing Horikita’s instruction, immediately moved his attention to the monitor. </p><p></p><hr /><p class="bold">Genres: English, Difficulty 1 </p><p class="bold">The Attacker’s Targets:</p><p class="italic">Kobayashi Yume, Watanabe Norihito, Sumida Makoto, Ninomiya Yui, Shibata Sou. </p><hr /><p>The genre is English. </p><p>Then, the targets are the students with the highest academic ability in Ichinose’s class. </p><p>It’s a solid choice, a genre that can be measured most objectively, which is probably the core of the class’s strategy. </p><p>As for the difficulty, there is not much choice to make as the score is still 0. </p><p>Since it is one of the top batters, the choice of an academically related genre is also a natural one. </p><p>The Horikita class, and the other classes, will use this first question as a springboard to understand how difficult the standard difficulty is. </p><p>However, many of the students in the Ichinose Class have a very balanced academic ability and the students are all above Academic Learning C. </p><p>The students to name will inevitably be very important, but the only way to judge which student is bad at which subject is by looking at the publicized results from the past, or from personal interactions. </p><p>It will be easy to find a gap in the opponent by using an atypical genre outside of academic abilities. </p><p>Because it could easily be a fatal wound for students who don’t know much about Subculture or Entertainment. </p><p>However, one would need a lot of courage to attack in this way at the first move. </p><p>Precisely because these genres are atypical, it is difficult to judge who would be good or bad at them, and it’s hard to estimate the degree of their difficulty. </p><p>Now, let’s see who Ichinose will protect. I’m going to stay quiet and wait for that. </p><p>The screen changed after the defense side finished making their nominations. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Successful Defender Protections:</p><p class="italic">Ninomiya Yui, Watanabe Norihito. </p><hr /><p>“That means those two are protected now, right?” </p><p>Nishimura, not having a full grasp of the situation after looking at the monitor, checked again with Horikita. </p><p>“...Yes, that’s what it means. With that, the Ichinose-san Class just got 2 unconditional points. Now, the rest is up to if the remaining 3 people can score points or not.” </p><p>3 students from the Ichinose Class were excluded from English. </p><p>They could name any one from among the 36 students except the leader, so no particular two people among them have a good chance of being protected. </p><p>This is the result of them simply targeting the students who are not particularly good at English. </p><p>Maybe it’s because this is the first turn, but they are utilizing a very honest method of attack. </p><p>The problems displayed for the opponent are also visible from our side. </p><hr /><p class="bold">‘Pick and sort the words in the [ ] to make a coherent sentence.’</p><p class="italic">[everyone/ amount/ necessary/ always/ a/ grow/ of/ hardship/ for/ is/ to] </p><hr /><p>“Hey, isn’t that pretty hard, Yuki?” </p><p>A shout from Ike and the others while Ike held his head and looked up. </p><p>At the same time, students who study well such as Horikita or Yosuke looked at each other with mixed feelings. </p><p>“So that’s the difficulty degree, huh?” </p><p>“Yeah. It’s not difficult at all for someone who does a normal amount of studying.” </p><p>Looking at the question that is considered to be the standard, the opinions in the class must be split in two. </p><p>Though imperfect, the Ichinose Class has an abundance of students with a stable academic ability. </p><p>How well will the bottom members of such a class do..? </p><p>The results of the remaining 3 names who challenged the first assignment got displayed on the monitor. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Correct Answers: </p><p class="italic">Kobayashi Yume, Shibata Sou </p><hr /><p>Together with the protections, that gives them 4 points. </p><p>That’s a very good start. </p><p>Next, the Ichinose Class will attack the Ryuen Class. </p><p>The genre is Economy. </p><p>Ryuen managed to protect 1 person. </p><p>However, the turn ended with him gaining only 1 point as no one came up with a correct answer. </p><p>The reality that the students of that class are not particularly good at studying is already showing itself. </p><p>It’s a shame that we gave Ichinose 4 points in comparison, but there’s no time for disappointment. </p><p>We still have a chance of making things up by earning more than 4 points on our turn to defend. </p><p>It’s important to not let your opponent protect anyone or to let them get correct answers, but the most important thing is to get a good result when you’re on defense. </p><p>This is because we can only score points with a successful defense. </p><p>Sakayanagi protected 1 person from Ryuen’s attack, while 3 people answered correctly, resulting in 4 points. </p><p>That’s the end of turn 1. The Sakayanagi Class is now attacking the Horikita Class. </p><p>“It’s finally time.” </p><p>“Yes. I wonder what Sakayanagi-san will do…” </p><p>The genre Sakayanagi chose got announced. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Genre: </p><p class="italic">Calculation, Difficulty 1 </p><hr /><p>Some calculation problems may simply involve adding and multiplying in the mind, while others may involve filling in holes to get the correct answer. </p><p>I do wonder how challenging it will be at difficulty 1. </p><p>There are surprisingly many students in the Horikita Class who are bad at calculation, as 7 of them have chosen it as their excluded topic. </p><p>However, what’s pulling my attention is the treatment of Koenji. </p><p>If the class is intending on keeping its promise to him, then it must use protection to safeguard him. </p><p>The man showed abundant talent during the Uninhabited Island Test, but otherwise, he fundamentally acts according to his own whims without a care for the class or directly contributing to Special Test efforts either. </p><p>However, there should be little reason for another class to go out of their way to target such a sharp student with high academic abilities. </p><p>A promise is a promise, though. </p><p>All things considered, what’s Horikita going to decide? </p><hr /><p class="bold">Defense Side Protected Names: </p><p class="italic">Sonoda Chiyo, Ichihashi Ruri, Okiya KYosuke, Ike Kanji, Makita Susumu</p><hr /><p>Koenji’s name wasn’t among the 5 named for protection by Horikita. </p><p>Koenji doesn’t care about the Special Test, and he didn’t seem to be reacting to this result. </p><p>“H-Hey, Suzune. Are you sure we shouldn’t protect him?” </p><p>Sudou frantically spoke up after constantly having Koenji on his mind. </p><p>“This is a test where we face the risk of expulsion only after being eliminated. I decided that there is no reason to protect him until he gets 2 questions wrong. There’s no reason to protect him from the start.” </p><p>“I guess that’s true, but still…” </p><p>Sudou was surprised for a moment but quickly got convinced. </p><p>“Let me say this, though, Koenji is free to answer seriously or to leave the paper empty. You’re alright with that, right?” </p><p>She had a tone of ex-post-facto approval, but Koenji doesn’t seem to mind. </p><p>“Do whatever you want.” </p><p>The class may have promised to protect him from an expulsion, but there’s no need to dote over him like a baby. </p><p>I can say Horikita is using a strategy based on minimum necessities. </p><p>She did tell him he is free to answer however he wants, but in truth, I’m sure it’s possible even Koenji would want to avoid a pointless elimination if he is named. </p><p>Even if there is a 99% chance of him being protected, anyone would still have the remaining 1% on his mind. </p><p>He won’t do anything to strangle his own neck. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Defense Side Successful Protections:</p><p class="italic">Okiya KYosuke, Ike Kanji</p><p class="bold">Attack Side Targets: </p><p class="italic">Ishikura Kayoko, Kikuchi Eita, Ikashira Kokoro </p><hr /><p>Impressively, Horikita managed to successfully protect two names at the start. </p><p>This is a good first turn with a big score of 2 points, but we’re in 3rd place for now. </p><p>We will be in 1st place if all 3 students give correct answers now, but that’s only an if. </p><p>The nervous students sat down at the front row of seats and looked at the problems on their tablets. </p><hr /><p class="italic">‘Time Limit: 1 Minute - 15><24>16=?’ </p><p><hr /></p><p>It’s a problem of multiplication. </p><p>Naturally, the 3 students are only allowed to use mental arithmetics. </p><p>An answer one might easily find by calculating on paper becomes a lot more difficult when done mentally. </p><p>It looks like an easy problem, but it’s clear from the students’ frantic appearances that they’re struggling. </p><p>1 minute passed by in no time, and the result is… 1 correct answer. </p><p>Excluding Ishikura, the other 2 got the wrong answers and apologetically returned to their seats. </p><p>Looking at her picks and the results, I’m feeling curious about Sakayanagi’s interesting choices after the 1st turn. </p><p>Ishikura is a student who is good at maths compared to others in the class. </p><p>Even if the direction here is a little different, it’s still related to digits as it is based on calculations. </p><p>I’m sure there was no need to choose this student and face the risk of a problem being solved correctly. </p><p>There are plenty of other weak links to attack, even not including the 7 students that were excluded. </p><p>It is possible Sakayanagi doesn’t understand Ishikura’s abilities, but she’s seen Ishikura challenge the maths problem during the finals held at the end of Year 1. </p><p>Leaving aside another random student, it’s hard to imagine Sakayanagi failed to consider that. </p><p>Perhaps she judged that a student good at maths like Ishikura would not be protected, and picked her to make sure she would have to face the assignment. </p><p>One series of attack and defense came to an end, and the turn was completed. </p><p>3 points is a decent sign for things to come, and I can say the class had a safe start. </p><p>Continuing, Horikita picked 5 names as the attacking side again in the 2nd turn. </p><p>The Ichinose Class missed all their protections, and 2 students got correct answers for 6 points in total. </p><p>The Ryuen Class protected 1 student, and 1 person answered correctly, coming to 3 points total. </p><p>The Sakayanagi Class protected 1 student, and 3 students answered correctly, making their score 8 points. </p><p>Things are just getting started, but the gap between classes is already creeping further apart in the 2nd turn. </p><p>Then, the 2nd defense turn of the Horikita Class. </p><p>Sakayanagi changed her pick of the genre from Calculation to Gourmet, and the difficulty is 1. </p><p>I wasn’t asked, but I’m sure Horikita already knows which students are capable or incapable in this genre. </p><p>She unhesitatingly conveyed her 5 picks for protection to the teacher. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Defense Side Protections:</p><p class="italic">None </p><p class="bold">Attack Side Targets: </p><p class="italic">Koenji Rokusuke, Hasebe Haruka, Hirata Yosuke, Yukimura Teruhiko, Onodera Kayano. </p><hr /><p>Unfortunately, all of the protections missed. </p><p>The problem became further evident when I took a glance at the opponent’s picks. </p><p>For the 2nd time again, Koenji’s name was displayed at the top of the 5 names listed. </p><p>It’s a long battle of 20 turns, so it’s natural for him to be targeted as well. </p><p>There’s nothing particularly interesting about this in itself, yet… The important thing is whether Koenji can solve the problem by himself, and how he’s going to act. </p><hr /><p class="italic">‘Please explain why, when eating French cuisine, the knife and the fork are put on top of the table in the shape of an ‘8’.’</p><hr /><p>It’s a simple question I could answer even back when I first enrolled here. </p><p>However, Koenji’s result is… incorrect due to lacking an answer. </p><p>I already saw clearly from behind him that he didn’t even make a move to grab the pencil. </p><p>Unfortunately, Keisei also seems to have gotten his answer wrong. </p><p>Immediately after this was conveyed, he smacked the table with a bitter face, as if he just remembered the right answer. </p><p>There are some unfortunate points in this result, but for now the class received 3 points. </p><p>That makes the score 6 in total. </p><p>“I saw that, Koenji, so you’re not going to take this seriously after all..?” </p><p>Sudou isn’t shouting but still displayed his anger. </p><p>One might say this is an act with representing the class in mind instead of showing his personal emotions. </p><p>It’s to be expected for Koenji to receive complaints when he didn’t even look like he was trying to solve the problem. </p><p>“There’s no point in scolding me. If you got any complaints, all you gotta do is protect me next time.” </p><p>“Shit, this fucking asshole…” </p><p>I understand why he’s angry, but there’s no need to worry that much about it until he answers 2 questions incorrectly. </p><p>I’m sure the class was put at ease when they saw Horikita keep her stance unchanged despite the empty paper. </p><p>It’s going to be a problem if things get out of hand and the class tries to expel Koenji instead of protecting him, but I’m sure they’re earnest in that they don’t want to waste the protections for nothing. </p><p>Koenji looked in Horikita’s direction for a moment, grinning, and returned to his own seat. </p><p>On the other hand, Keisei who simply answered incorrectly approached Horikita to apologize. </p><p>“Sorry Horikita, I knew the answer, but I got too nervous…” </p><p>“I’m not that worried about you. I’m going to protect you one time if they use the same genre to attack again though. You’re fine with that, right?” </p><p>Sakayanagi won’t overlook any weaknesses. </p><p>That’s precisely why Keisei nodded after Horikita conveyed that she would protect him if she felt a risk, and Horikita nodded back in reply. </p><p>The battle continued like this while repeating attacks and defenses. </p><p>The students don’t even have the time to look at their phone screens for a counter-measure as they open their problems. </p><p>On the other hand, there is no risk of the leader being named, but they have the least time to rest. </p><p>They have to think about what assignment to give the opponent, and how to change their picks over time. </p><p>Horikita, not even having the time to speak, is spending most of her time typing things on her phone or sometimes writing on her notebook left open on the table. </p><p>It’s time for Sakayanagi’s attack in the 3rd turn. </p><p>She chose a Gourmet assignment again. </p><p>Further, the difficulty is also 1 again. </p><p>I thought she wouldn’t choose the same genre again after seeing how easy the question was and after 3 people from our side answered correctly, but it looks like she has something else in mind. </p><p>Perhaps she saw the fact that strong students such as Koenji and Keisei answered wrong as a chink in the class’s armor. </p><p>As it was conveyed beforehand, Horikita protected Keisei and picked 4 other names. </p><p>However…</p><hr /><p class="bold">Defense Successful Protections:</p><p class="italic">None <p class="bold">Attacker Targets: </p><p class="italic">Koenji Rokusuke, Miyamoto Soushi, Ijuuin Wataru, Satou Maya, Azuma Sana</p><hr /><p>Koenji is being targeted for the 2nd time in a row now, while the other picks are completely different. </p><p>In reverse, Sakayanagi did not name Keisei, who is being protected. </p><p>“Did she guess what I was doing..?” </p><p>This is a battle of predictions. </p><p>It is a given that the defender will move to prevent an elimination if the same genre is chosen again. </p><p>As such, there’s no point in aiming for Keisei who would naturally be protected. </p><p>However, that goes for Koenji too. </p><p>What made the difference between Koenji and Keisei in Sakayanagi’s decision? </p><p>One thing is certain, which is that she clearly predicted what our side would do as if reading our minds. </p><p>Koenji stood up again and confidently started walking. </p><p>“Koenji-kun. Considering the class’s promise, I can’t force you to do anything. But, I think it’s also best for you if you do your best to answer correctly.” </p><p>Private conversations are strictly prohibited once everyone is seated and the timer has started. </p><p>So Yosuke had no choice but to implore Koenji while he passed by him. </p><p>However, perhaps not having the slightest doubt on whether he will be protected or not in the next turn, Koenji gave back an empty paper again. </p><p>His classmates couldn’t hide their emotions after seeing this, but the saving grace is that the remaining 4 answered correctly. </p><p>To put it in a different way, the 3rd turn’s questions were more simple and based on common knowledge. </p><p>That’s precisely why it’s hard to be happy with the result, since if Koenji took this seriously, the class could have gotten a full score even while missing protections. </p><p>By the 3rd turn’s end, the first place is the Sakayanagi Class with 11 points, second place is the Horikita Class with 10 points, 3rd place is the Ichinose Class with 9 points and the last place is the Ryuen Class with 5 points. </p><p>We would be ahead with 12 points if Koenji was acting like a functional member of the class. </p><p>He completely ignored Yosuke’s request, so there’s nothing more to be done about him now. </p><p>I’d like to stop the Sakayanagi Class early after they’ve firmly kept 1st place since the beginning, but all we can do during the first half is watch and depend on Ryuen’s skill. </p><p>However, the Ryuen Class currently seems to be very slow both when attacking and defending, and they are being forced into a bitter battle. </p><p>My impression is that more than predictions and luck, the difference in ability between students is the biggest factor. </p><p>The 4th turn, Horikita’s defense turn. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Genre: </p><p class="italic">Gourmet, Difficulty 2</p><hr /><p>It’s a big surprise to see Sakayanagi pick the same genre for the third time now. </p><p>The difficulty is being raised up to 2 this time, however. </p><p>In other words, she’s spending 1 point in this attack. </p><p>“Gourmet again? What the hell is Sakayanagi trying to do?” </p><p>However, the students are more concerned by the choice of the same genre instead of the degree of difficulty. </p><p>With Koenji already in reach of elimination, they might be attempting to push further on the offense. </p><p>After the simple questions during the last 2 turns, the difficulty is being raised for the first time. </p><p>This may also in part be an experiment. </p><p>“At any rate, they’re not going to aim for Koenji again… right?” </p><p>“Don’t you get it? I think they actually see this as a good chance to eliminate Koenji.” </p><p>After giving empty papers in a row for the last two Gourmet questions, Koenji’s back is against the wall. </p><p>Should we consider that he must be protected because he is in reach of elimination, or that the opponent will not take the trouble to target him because of that fact instead? </p><p>From this genre selection, it’s clear that the enemy’s focus is on Koenji. </p><p>However, that’s because this class is in a specific circumstance unlike the others. </p><p>This problem comes before any strategy. </p><p>If Koenji hands in an empty paper here, he will become the first elimination. </p><p>As such, as long as there is a contract to protect him, Horikita’s only choice is to make a move if she wants to uphold the contract. </p><p>If the enemy is targeting him, then Horikita can guarantee 1 point by protecting Koenji. </p><p>All eyes gathered on Horikita, and Koenji’s name wasn’t among the 5 names she said out loud. </p><hr /><p class="bold">Defense Side Successful Protections: </p><p class="italic">Shinohara Sakki, Sudou Ken <p class="bold">Attacker Targets:</p><p class="italic">Koenji Rokusuke, Sotomura Hideo, Miyake Akito </p><hr /><p>Now, even our classmates who have been protecting their calm so far started showing signs of agitation. </p><p>“H-Horikita-san?” </p><p>Yosuke was the most surprised. </p><p>The man who never doubted Horikita would protect the contract stood up. </p><p>“Are you sure about this, Suzune? Koenji’s going to be eliminated if he gets this wrong.” </p><p>Sudou also asked. </p><p>Horikita however didn’t answer, and kept staring ahead. </p><p>The one person who didn’t even show a change of expression was the man in question, Koenji. </p><p>“Heheh. Horikita, now you’ve done it, girl.” </p><p>If one doesn’t think too deeply, then it will look like Horikita just abandoned Koenji. </p><p>Someone who breaks their contract. </p><p>That’s the label this move will stick her with. </p><p>Considering the series of events since the Unanimous Special Test, I can’t say that it’s a good move to lose the class’s trust here. </p><p>Koenji didn’t say anything else and sat down on one of the seats at the front like the other students. </p><p>The problem is certainly more difficult than the last two. </p><p>I caught some glimpses of students looking at each other, tilting their necks and looking for help from others. </p><p>I don’t know how much Koenji knows about the Gourmet subject, but it seems very dubious. </p><p>Then, 3 students started answering. </p><p>The man who never touched a pen until now quickly moved. </p><p>From what I can see, he’s clearly moving his hand, but…</p><hr /><p class="bold">Correct Answers: </p><p class="italic">Koenji Rokusuke</p><hr /><p>Koenji’s name appeared first in the box, the one for the correct answers this time instead of empty or wrong answers. </p><p>Basically, Koenji solved the problem in order to avoid being eliminated. </p><p>“Look at that, Koenji. So you were getting worried too, huh!?” </p><p>Sudou teased Koenji in a loud voice, while also seemingly feeling relieved. </p><p>This means he doesn’t want another student to be eliminated, even if he doesn’t like him. </p><p>“I’ll let you interpret it however you want.” </p><p>I don’t understand how Koenji thinks, but it’s a natural move if you look at it with common sense. </p><p>He was going to be eliminated if he didn’t answer correctly, and become a candidate for expulsion. </p><p>However, Horikita’s choice drew the most attention this turn. </p><p>The reality is that she didn’t protect Koenji while he was under the risk of elimination if he answered wrongly again. </p><p>Even if she was confident he would answer correctly, she still had to protect him. </p><p>The class felt worried about that, and even Yosuke had to ask what happened. </p><p>This man, who is the person concerned, is of course an exception. </p><p>Koenji passed by me, stood by Horikita, and muttered to her. </p><p>“What are you trying to do? Care to explain?” </p><p>“Explain? Is there a problem?” </p><p>“Oh?” </p><p>Koenji smiled when he saw Horikita looking up at him without a hint of apology in her eyes. </p><p>“You didn’t get eliminated. You don’t need to worry about expulsion for now.” </p><p>“I was going to be eliminated if I didn’t answer correctly, though. What do you think about that?” </p><p>“You did answer correctly, though.” </p><p>“Hehehe. That’s true, I’m sorry for jumping to a hasty conclusion.” </p><p>“Why don’t you return to your seat now that we’ve solved the misunderstanding? I can’t see the monitor because of how tall you are.” </p><p>This exchange, indicating that Horikita has clearly abandoned Koenji did not quell the confusion, except for Koenji. </p><p>I could have moved to explain Horikita’s thinking and the benefit of not protecting Koenji, but I will of course continue staying quiet here. </p><p>It’s not that she wants to make her classmates feel anxious for no reason, but she has a different objective. </p><p>The fact that Horikita, the leader, isn't explaining things to her classmates is the foremost proof of this. </p><p>Horikita didn’t wave under the suspicious eyes turned towards her by the students. </p><p>Horikita didn’t protect Koenji from Sakayanagi’s attack in turn 5 either. </p><p>At the same time, however, Koenji’s name was also missing from the attacker’s targets. </p><p>For the other students, Koenji would become a target now that he is in reach of elimination without protection, but Sakayanagi’s thinking is different. </p><p>It’s possible that she recognizes Koenji as a tough opponent who will take this seriously, after he was the only person to correctly answer the difficulty 2 Gourmet question. </p><p>I’m sure many students here have the same misunderstanding. </p><p>After Koenji answered correctly instead of handing in an empty sheet, the other students no longer expect wrong answers from him. </p><p>That’s why they’re avoiding targeting him. </p><p>They think Horikita gambled losing her allies’ trust on this, and won. </p><p>Koenji’s name wasn’t in the list. Horikita’s expression clouded after this result. </p><p>“I see that they won’t jump on board so easily…” </p><p>I was able to hear her muttering to herself, since I’m seated close by to her. </p><p>The turns continued during the first half of the game as I enjoyed many highlights. </p><p>This could be said for every class, but the number of students who are answering incorrectly is increasing as time passes, and at turn 7, Ishizaki turned out to be the first elimination from the Ryuen Class. </p><p>Continuing to turn 8, Yukimura and Ijuuin from the Horikita Class were eliminated at the same time, while the Ryuen Class lost Isoyama and Yano. </p><p>Kamuro got eliminated from the Sakayanagi Class. </p><p>When turn 10, which is the ending point for the first half, was finished, Hondou from the Horikita Class, Morofuji from the Ryuen Class and Yamamura from the Sakayanagi Class were eliminated. </p><hr /><p class="bold">First Half Scores: </p><p class="italic">1st Place: Sakayanagi A Class with 29 points. Eliminations: Kamuro, Yamamura. </p><p class="italic">2nd Place: Horikita B Class with 28 points. Eliminations: Yukimura, Ishuuin, Hondou. </p><p class="italic">3rd Place: Ichinose C Class with 24 points. Eliminations: None. </p><p class="italic">4th Place: Ryuen D Class with 19 points. Eliminations: Ishizaki, Isoyama, Yano, Morofuji. </p><hr /><p>9 elimination in total. </p><p>It seems like a lot, but things will get even faster during the second half. </p><p>Because there are already a lot of students who got 2 questions wrong and are now in reach of elimination. </p><p>The Ichinose Class is the only one that still has no eliminations. </p><p>This may seem like it’s because of Ichinose’s fine play, but it’s not. </p><p>“The strategy went well, didn’t it, Horikita-san?” </p><p>Yosuke called out to Horikita, congratulating her. </p><p>“Yes. Her stance remains the same in this Special Test too. We managed to push her back, thanks to that.” </p><p>How many of Horikita’s classmates noticed her strategy against Ichinose, I wonder? </p><p>There is a reason their eliminations remains 0. </p><p>That’s because Horikita made sure to put 5 students in reach of elimination first. </p><p>Ichinose will certainly protect her classmates. </p><p>So she continued while spreading out her attacks to make sure there won’t be a 6th student in reach of elimination. </p><p>Even if it meant spreading her attacks out, Ichinose will continue protecting those in reach of elimination. </p><p>None of her protections succeeded after 5 students were put in reach of elimination. </p><p>Because if she fails to protect someone and they get eliminated, the student will be under risk of expulsion. </p><p>“She really doesn’t waver, though. Nobody else would go so far to protect others. Because she should know that even if they get through the first half, it’s going to get a lot harder later on.” </p><p>The fact that they have the most wrong answers among the 4 classes proves this. </p><p>“Ichinose-san has to protect her class from Ryuen-kun in the second half. That’s going to be difficult.” </p><p>“If she is fine with throwing away all her protections during the second half, then just maybe…” </p><p>It’s still Ryueen. </p><p>It’s very possible he will attack head on from the first or second turn. </p><p>“Let’s get back to us. It’s just a 1 point difference, so we have a good chance of winning.” </p><p>Most expected the Sakayanagi Class to be far ahead, but Horikita is actually keeping up. </p><p>I have the impression Horikita is lacking in her ability to read her opponent compared to Sakayanagi, but her classmates are covering for her. </p><p>“Excluding the cases where a question is answered correctly because of a protection, from what I can see, the school has set things up so that around half the students are able to answer the questions. So I think the correct answer ratio goes down to 20% when difficulty is raised by 1, and down to 10% when raised by 2.” </p><p>One can’t expect many correct answers if difficulty 3 is used, but we can’t use it often because of the 2 point cost. </p><p>It’s a big loss if the target ends up being protected, so I doubt it will be used that often during the second half. </p><p>The fight for the top is a highlight, but the bottom 2 classes also draw my interest. </p><p>The Ryuen Class in particular has fallen into a very difficult situation in the second half. </p><p>Assuming that trends will remain similar and that the number of eliminations will continue increasing, the line for 1st place will be around 50-55 points. </p><p>This means Ryuen won’t even be in the competition if he can’t get at least 30 points during the second half alone. </p><p>What I can say overall is that the students with high academic ability are indeed difficult to target. </p><p>However, they can also be difficult to protect at the same time and some students made mistakes in surprising genres. </p><p>Problems that aren’t related to academic ability like Subculture and Gourmet were also often more difficult than the problems that were related to academic ability. </p><p>Incidentally, I also messed up on a problem that was unrelated to academic ability. </p><p>“What is the two-legged animal raised in a zoo known throughout the world for its cuteness?” </p><p>I randomly wrote down ‘dog’ as I had no idea what the answer was and Horikita sent me a cold gaze. </p><p>Then, it turned out the answer was Lesser Panda. </p><p></p></div>
