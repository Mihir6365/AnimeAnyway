    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <h2>The Beginning of 2nd Year 3rd Semester</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        There was a crowd on the road to school. It’s a scene I couldn’t see during the winter vacation.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t hate the scenery on quiet days either, but, surprisingly, I think I rather like seeing a crowd of
        students.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps I’m getting used to my widening worldview.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps I’m unconsciously starting to value what I’m about to lose as the end draws near.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s wrong, Ayanokouji? You’re just standing there.”

    </p>
    <p>I saw my girlfriend Kei looking up at me as she warmly hugged my right arm.

    </p>
    <p>“Nothing.”

    </p>
    <p>I muttered, and we started walking.

    </p>
    <p>At the very least, spending my day with her alleviates my boredom.

    </p>
    <p>Especially because Kei chooses a subject to talk about from her day and creates a conversation even when I’m
        being quiet.

    </p>
    <p>I’m finding myself more and more divorced from spending time alone by myself, though.

    </p>
    <p>If I was asked whether the days I’m spending with her are necessary or not, I would say It's Fifty-fifty.

    </p>
    <p>The reason they’re necessary is that my communication skills get better as I converse with a partner.

    </p>
    <p>This is an important opportunity to polish a skill I lack proficiency in.

    </p>
    <p>Because I’m unskilled with this, I often fail when replying to her.

    </p>
    <p>In particular, there are still cases where I fail to choose the correct reply when Kei is in a bad mood, which
        just worsens her mood even further.

    </p>
    <p>This is something I have trouble with.

    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, reducing my time to polish other skills is a disadvantage.

    </p>
    <p>The advantages of increasing my communication skills and learning how to analyze romantic partners and the other
        gender sacrifice many other things in exchange.

    </p>
    <p>“Why are you staring at me like that?”

    </p>
    <p>“Is it annoying?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, but… Yeah, it makes me want to kiss again. A lot, actually.”

    </p>
    <p>The day before our winter vacation ended, Kei and I spent our time together in our room all day.

    </p>
    <p>There’s no need to say where things lead to when people of opposite genders spend a lot of close time together.

    </p>
    <p>Kei grabbed my right arm tighter and tried to pull me closer.

    </p>
    <p>In the end, we were together all the way to our classroom, excluding the time of changing our shoes at the
        entrance.

    </p>
    <p>Around half the students seem to be here already, so the classroom is very lively.

    </p>
    <p>“Good morning, everyone~”

    </p>
    <p>The start of the 3rd semester.

    </p>
    <p>Kei waved at her friends in the classroom.

    </p>
    <p>She slowly pulled her arm away from mine, and winked at me before saying, ‘see you!’ After that deeply
        affectionate move, I moved to a seat around the center of the classroom and put my mostly empty bag down.

    </p>
    <p>The number of necessary items to bring is reduced thanks to the classes being held with tablets, but I still need
        a bag.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, even I’m blushing to see you coming to school like that, Ayanokouji.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou was already in the classroom, and called out to me in an unpleasant way.

    </p>
    <p>“Only a super popular guy goes to school with a girl in his arm. Damn it, I’m so jealous!”

    </p>
    <p>Personally, I think it’s an embarrassing look but it looks like he thinks it’s enviable.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not as if I asked her to do that.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, I bet. Actually, it’d be really creepy if you did ask her for that, like, really creepy.”

    </p>
    <p>He approached me while repeating himself with a mutter.

    </p>
    <p>“Enough about you getting flirty, did you get that mail about a year 1 student being taken into custody? I'm sure
        I don't need to worry about you, but be careful, okay?"

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, I think I saw something like that.”

    </p>
    <p>I received a mail from the school at the end of the winter vacation about two year 1 students receiving
        punishment.

    </p>
    <p>The names were omitted, but it seems a third party spotted a couple committing an act of illicit sexual
        relationship on a roof.

    </p>
    <p>Acts that are related to sexual stimulation are forbidden, so the punishment was obvious.

    </p>
    <p>“They should do that in their room, y’know? Seeing as you’re a senior, what do you think about that?”

    </p>
    <p>“What are you talking about?”

    </p>
    <p>“...I mean, like… You also want to do all kinds of stuff outdoors… Don’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>He shouldn’t ask about things like that if it embarrasses him, but I’ll refrain from pressing him about that.

    </p>
    <p>“All I can say is that the mail was correct. The school grounds are full of observers and cameras. There’s a high
        risk of being found out if you commit strange acts. So, I never make the choice of letting my instincts take
        over.”

    </p>
    <p>“R-Right. I don’t think anyone else could be that strong… Creepy.”

    </p>
    <p>I’m not entirely sure why, but it seems I ended up creeping Sudou out.

    </p>
    <p>“I guess not.”

    </p>
    <p>I wasn’t really paying that much attention, but I heard Sudou breathe a heavy sigh.

    </p>
    <p>I think it was an instinctive sigh, but he frantically apologized after regretting it.

    </p>
    <p>“That wasn’t because of you just now, okay? I was just sighing.”

    </p>
    <p>“Doesn’t bother me. Is there something else on your mind, though?”

    </p>
    <p>One could be as loud as they wanted in this crowd, but I didn’t hear any other students sighing that much.

    </p>
    <p>I definitely can’t ignore this discrepancy.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m just feeling a bit tired these days. I thought I could handle studying and sports at the same time, but it’s
        been really hard… Heh, just kidding.”

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps considering it a failure that he explained the reason for his sigh, Sudou then dodged the subject.

    </p>
    <p>It’s probably going to have a bad effect if I tell him I’m worried about him now.

    </p>
    <p>As such, I’ll just give him one piece of advice.

    </p>
    <p>“The faster you try to stuff knowledge into your brain, the faster it drops right back out. Slow and steady wins
        the race.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Yeah. Anyways, let’s make it a good semester, alright?”

    </p>
    <p>He changed his expression after leaving me with that and went to his seat.

    </p>
    <p>Right afterwards, Satou arrived at the classroom and passed by me while greeting her classmates.

    </p>
    <p>“Intense morning, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>Muttering that, she added on,
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Thanks for the display’, and joined the girls group. It seems she observed Kei and I from behind on our way to
        school.
