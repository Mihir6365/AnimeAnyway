    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <h2>The Song of Loneliness</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        December 24.
    </p>
    <p>First day of winter vacation.
    </p>
    <p>I woke up in the morning with a slightly strange sensation.
    </p>
    <p>“...That was a weird dream.”</p>
    <p> Muttering to myself, I sat up on my bed.
    </p>
    <p>Though only slightly, it looks like I was sweating in my sleep.
    </p>
    <p>I don’t normally care about my dreams that much.
    </p>
    <p>Whether it’s a good dream, a bad dream, a strange dream, a dream is just a
        dream and not reality, and humans are fundamentally creatures that forget
        their dreams.
    </p>
    <p>I wouldn’t be surprised to find exceptions to this in the world, but I’m also one
        of those who forget.
    </p>
    <p>Even if I remember them right after waking up, they get thrown out of my
        memory after a very short amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>“I think the homeroom teacher was a bunny-girl..?”</p>
    <p> Even if I try to force myself to remember, it’s mostly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>These may be strange words to hear for a third party…
        No, I don’t think the main point of the dream was the bunny-girl.
    </p>
    <p>It would be a waste of effort to keep trying to remember my dream.
    </p>
    <p>I quickly gave up on trying to remember it.
    </p>
    <p>School’s closed, so I slowly started my morning routine.
    </p>
    <p>Toothbrushes and cups of different colours lined up on the washstand.
    </p>
    <p>My daily life started to go back to the usual when Kei and I distanced
        ourselves from each other after always spending our time together.
    </p>
    <p>Still, that doesn’t mean our relationship has ended.
    </p>
    <p>Resulting from our disagreement, one could say that our relationship has
        entered a period of cold war.
    </p>
    <p>I don’t feel even a slight psychological change due to this.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it’s because things are developing according to my guidance, but if
        this was unexpected, then perhaps I could have felt a little shaken.
    </p>
    <p>“...I wonder.”</p>
    <p>
        One would have to consider the other party as absolutely essential in order to
        have a change of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>Without that, I don’t believe that emotions will be moved.
    </p>
    <p>Even if one considers the other person a part of their
        <a class="tooltip"
            data-tooltip="the most important reason or purpose for someone or something's existence.">raison
            d'être,</a> there is no
        need to hesitate to make your partner suffer or throw them away if it is
        necessary.
    </p>
    <p>However, leaving emotion aside, I believe that one should have a sense of
        responsibility as a partner.
    </p>
    <p>As long as two people are spending time together, it is their joint liability to not
        make that time displeasurable.
    </p>
    <p>Still, if someone gives you their time, the most important thing in one’s life,
        then you should make them happy rather than not.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, this idea is based on human society’s moral values.
    </p>
    <p>It’s not a good policy to make someone the subject of my experimentation
        forever, making them psychologically uneasy and burdening them.
    </p>
    <p>It’s not as if I barged into this cold war without thinking; I have a plan.
    </p>
    <p>Going to buy christmas presents together like we promised before our
        relationship worsened.
    </p>
    <p>It's still a possibility.
    </p>
    <p>The day we had originally planned to go on a date in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, there were signs of rain outside and the cold weather had
        continued since before the winter vacation.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a little unfortunate, but there’s rain forecasted for tomorrow’s Christmas
        too, so I can’t expect pleasant weather.
    </p>
    <p>I can’t control anything about the weather, so there’s no helping that, but
        there’s something else that was outside my expectations.
    </p>
    <p>I looked at the calendar on top of the table in my room.
    </p>
    <p>December.
        The 24th and the 25th are marked with a pink heart, but…
        That was the night of yesterday when our second term ended.
    </p>
    <p>I tried to call Kei directly to meet with her on the 24th, but she didn’t answer.
    </p>
    <p>I waited a while and sent a message to wait for her reaction, but it was left
        unread.
    </p>
    <p>I thought about what to do for an hour, until a phone call finally came back.
    </p>
    <p>The first word Kei told me with her weak but rough voice was ‘influenza’.
    </p>
    <p>The seasonal cold is an illness that spreads unrelated to age.
    </p>
    <p>It’s very common around November and December, so this isn’t anything rare.
    </p>
    <p>Apparently, she suddenly got sick and had to rest.
    </p>
    <p>She was weakened, but I’m sure she wanted to fulfil our promise for the 24th,
        even if she had to crawl there.
    </p>
    <p>However, influenza spreads from splashes in the air.
    </p>
    <p>If she went to Keyaki Mall anyway, she would have troubled other people as
        well.
    </p>
    <p>She said that she was already feeling strange before the illness, and first and
        foremost felt bad for not taking better care of her health.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, I could not blame her for her influenza, so I first told her to take
        care of herself.
    </p>
    <p>I told her that our promise was still there, and that we would choose a different
        day.
    </p>
    <p>It could still be cancelled if Kei tells me that she wants to cancel the promise
        after all, but I don't think that's currently a possibility.
    </p>
    <p>If she has a change of mind, that would be due to a third party, but I don’t think
        someone who is strongly independent like Kei would listen to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>Because I don’t think she would abandon the choice if there is a hope of
        restoring the relationship.
    </p>
    <p>It’s unclear if her influenza will heal quickly, but at this stage, the conversation
        ended with a decision on meeting towards the end of the year.
    </p>
    <p>It’s easy to infer that there was a lot she wanted to check about our
        relationship and circumstances, but I don’t think she could converse normally
        when she was stricken by a high fever, so I told her to get some rest first and
        quickly ended the phone call.
    </p>
    <p>When I checked on her again in detail after, she was wondering how to handle
        her friends buying and bringing her necessities while she’s in bed.
    </p>
    <p>It seems that arrangements have been made to respond to emergencies even
        in the middle of night, which was helpful because of the curfew in that area.
    </p>
    <p>So, that was last night, on the 23rd.
    </p>
    <p>This morning, I learned that there were many more students of all years
        discovered to be infected with influenza.
    </p>
    <p>The one good thing for the year-two students is that they survived the special
        tests without any incident.
    </p>
    <p>There may have been those among them who were struggling with poor
        health in secret, though.
    </p>
    <p>I haven’t had any close contact with Kei for the last few days, so there’s no
        change in my condition.
    </p>
    <p>The more important problem is how to spend today.
    </p>
    <p>All of my plans for Christmas Eve, today, and Christmas, tomorrow, are gone.
    </p>
    <p>“Good morning Ayanokoji-kun. I heard that Karuizawa-san got influenza, is
        she okay?”</p>
    <p>
        A message from Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>The messages continued.
    </p>
    <p>“It looks like there’s a lot of other sick people. Are you okay?”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose does own a wide web of information, so she quickly learns
        everything.
    </p>
    <p>It looks like she also has a grasp on Kei’s bodily condition.
    </p>
    <p>“Unfortunately, I think she’ll have to be in bed for a while.”</p>
    <p>
        “I see… I’m worried about her. Let me know if you ever need any help.”</p>
    <p>
        “Thanks.”</p>
    <p>
        After repeating that exchange a few times, she asked me what I’m going to do
        today.
    </p>
    <p>This day was normally cleared up for Kei, but… I still have to stop by Keyaki
        Mall to pick up a certain item, so my plans remain the same.
    </p>
    <p>“I think I’ll go to the gym or something.”</p>
    <p>
        I followed the flow of the conversation, and since I’m not in the mood to meet
        anyone, I replied so.
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, right. Err, what time do you think you’ll be there?”</p>
    <p>
        “I have nothing else to do, so probably the forenoon.”</p>
    <p>
        “Oh. I was also planning on going to the gym during the day, but maybe I
        shouldn’t?”</p>
    <p>
        “Why?”</p>
    <p>
        “I mean, won't that look like we arranged to meet on purpose? Even though
        it’s just a coincidence.”</p>
    <p>
        We just happened to want to go to the gym, and the time we wanted to go
        coincided.
    </p>
    <p>There’s no need to worry about every little thing.
    </p>
    <p>This may be out of consideration for my girlfriend Kei, but I think that’s
        excessive.
    </p>
    <p>In contrast, if we adjusted things now, it would seem more like deceit.
    </p>
    <p>“You don’t need to worry about that. I’ll just go there as I planned. I’ll see you
        there if we happen to meet in the gym.”</p>
    <p>
        My message was quickly marked read, and she replied with a sticker of
        something like a mascot character holding an OK sign.
    </p>
    <p>Now then, I can put off getting dressed and doing my hair to get ready to go
        out for later.
    </p>
    <p>The hour’s just 9 o’clock.
    </p>
    <p>I should do laundry, clean and spend my time in the morning relaxing.
    </p>
    <p></p>
