    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
The school day ended and I headed for Keyaki mall with Kei. 

</p><p>I wasn’t planning on coming here today, but she asked to stop by.

</p><p>However, Kei, who invited me, has a clouded expression on her face instead of her usual smile.

</p><p>“You seem gloomy. What’s wrong?”

</p><p>“Oh… Umm…”

</p><p>Seemingly wanting to say something, she looked at me after hesitating a little.

</p><p>“H-Hey, Kiyotaka. What’s gonna happen to me in this test..? I don’t think I can keep answering correctly if I am repeatedly targeted… Can you protect me?” 

</p><p>Not hiding her anxious expression, Kei asked me while looking afraid.

</p><p>“You’re not the only one who’s unconfident. Most students in the class, whether a little or a lot, should be anxious. Horikita, the leader, also understands this, of course.”

</p><p>“I wish you were the leader… You could protect me then…”

</p><p>I’d especially lie to avoid giving a reply to that blind belief, but clearing her anxiety away is what’s important.

</p><p>“Horikita will protect her classmates. However, she can’t make it so that the class has 0 possibility of losing. However, the decision to make then will be on who to cut off. If there are other eliminations than you, then it won’t be a simple thing to choose you, as you are someone who can gather the girls together. Besides, Horikita understands that you’re my girlfriend. Even if I don’t protect you, you’ll still be difficult to target for Horikita.” 

</p><p>I said this from a point of not me guiding Horikita towards this direction, but of her analyzing things in this way herself.

</p><p>If she wants my cooperation in the future, Kei will be a hard ingredient to abandon.

</p><p>However, Kei’s priority will only heighten if there are other eliminations. 

</p><p>If Horikita had to choose between Kei or Yousuke, even if she does hold the title of being my girlfriend, I don’t think Horikita’s decision would change unless I directly intervened and forced her to.

</p><p>“Y-Yeah. I’m your girlfriend, aren’t I? Horikita-san won’t pick me that easily.”

</p><p>“Yeah. Besides, we can only protect 5 people among the 40 students. It won’t be a surprise to see numerous eliminations when we consider that. There should be plenty of eliminations in every class after the 20 turns are over. Even if 10 people are eliminated, you, the leader of the girls, will not be picked. Am I wrong?” 

</p><p>“...Yeah, you’re right.”

</p><p>Many eliminations wouldn’t be a surprise even for a class of superior students like  Class-A.

</p><p>Trying to avoid even one elimination will only strangle a class.

</p><p>Even in an extreme case like half the class being eliminated, all Kei has to do is to avoid last place.

</p><p>This will be useful to ease her anxiety even if just by a little.

</p><p>The psychological burden on her will be lessened just by making her understand she is by no means lowly valued.

</p><p>However, this could also be a factor of danger depending on her way of looking at it.

</p><p>Because others who want to damage me might try to do it indirectly by expelling Kei.

</p><p>At any rate, this Special Test will recheck each and everyone’s value.

</p><p>Who’s necessary for the class, and who isn’t? 

</p><p>This will let people from both the inside and the outside see the answer to that.
