    <h3>Part 3</h3><p>
I’ve had more than a few opportunities to get involved with members of other classes recently, such as Ryuuen, Katsuragi, Ichinose and Shiranami. 

</p><p>Today, I’m spending time with Kamuro, and members of A Class. 

</p><p>Further, they’re not just simple students. 

</p><p>They’re students who are close to Sakayanagi with something like an executive position.

</p><p>“Good morning Hashimoto-senpai, Kamuro-senpai, Kitou-senpai.” 

</p><p>“Good morning.” 

</p><p>“H-Hey!” 

</p><p>Many of the Year One students called out to them as we approached Keyaki Mall. 

</p><p>“They really like you guys.” 

</p><p>“This is normal for us, since we’re in A Class.”

</p><p>It’s apparent that they work closely with the Year One students, their juniors, and that they know each other by name and face.

</p><p>“I don’t think they’d talk like this to Sakayanagi, though.”

</p><p>“It’s a different thing with the princess. Some juniors can’t just start chatting to her. We could say Sakayanagi’s out of their reach.” 

</p><p>I suppose she always has the envy of her juniors.

</p><p>“Where do you want to go, by the way?” 

</p><p>“Hm? Well, do you want to avoid attention, Ayanokouji? Or do you not mind?” 

</p><p>“I don’t love pointlessly drawing attention”

</p><p>“I guessed as much. In that case, the most common place to go to would be karaoke or something like that, but-”

</p><p>Hashimoto peeked at Kamuro’s expression, and she looked back at him with fierce eyes. 

</p><p>“No.” 

</p><p>“Ah, of course.”

</p><p>Karaoke was denied with that one remark, and Hashimoto started thinking about other options.

</p><p>“Do you dislike karaoke, Kamuro-san?”

</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. Don’t ask me why.”

</p><p>Hiyori asked Kamuro while walking next to her, but she pushed her away without a reply.

</p><p>While that’s happening, me and Kitou are walking behind them. 

</p><p>“She’s tone-deaf!” 

</p><p>“Kitou!”

</p><p>Kitou just muttered that, but Kamuro heard him and turned around with a devilish look on her face.

</p><p>“What, are you tone-deaf?” 

</p><p>It’s true that tone-deaf people probably hate karaoke. 

</p><p>If that’s the case, I can understand why Kamuro didn’t want to explain herself.

</p><p>“Shut up.” 

</p><p>“...Kamuro has really sharp ears.”

</p><p>I’m not sure if he regretted it, but Kitou added that on in a tiny voice.

</p><p>“I can hear that too. Anyway, stop telling nonsense to Ayanokouji.”

</p><p>“It shouldn’t be a problem.” 

</p><p>Do they get along, or not? It’s hard to decide, but they definitely know each other’s tempers. 

</p><p>“Let’s calm down, Kamuro-chan. We’re not going to karaoke, okay?” 

</p><p>Kitou put his hand on my shoulder and instructed me to slow down our walking pace. 

</p><p>Then, he started speaking when Kamuro’s sharp ears could probably no longer hear us. 

</p><p>“Hashimoto and Kamuro are troubling you.”

</p><p>“No, I don’t mind. Shiina is smiling and having fun too.” 

</p><p>“That’s good to hear.” 

</p><p>Kitou usually has a scary face, but I’m not surprised, since I saw a different side of him on the school trip.

</p><p>In fact, he’s a student who can really think properly.

</p><p>“You’re acting differently than you did back when we were with Ryuuen. Is it because you don’t see me as an enemy yet?”

</p><p>“I don’t want to start something with anyone, even if we’re enemies. I’ll show the minimum amount of courtesy I need to, as long as the other party has suitable manners.”

</p><p>He’s saying that he won’t act in a rigid way even to his enemies.

</p><p>“Hey, Shiina-chan. There’s something I wanna ask you if that’s okay.”

</p><p>“What is it?” 

</p><p>“I was wondering what kind of relationship you have with Ayanokouji.”

</p><p>“I already told Kamuro-san as well, but he’s a friend I get along well with.”

</p><p>“Does that mean you’re free right now?” 

</p><p>“Free?”

</p><p>“I’m asking if you have a boyfriend.” 

</p><p>“Are you trying to pick up a girl, right now?”

</p><p>“It’s not a problem if we’re both free, right? Are you going to date me instead, Kamuro-chan?”

</p><p>She walked up to the man acting so non-seriously, and kicked him on the butt without holding back.

</p><p>“Ouch!” 

</p><p>Hashimoto jumped up holding his butt and apologized with his hands clasped together.

</p><p>“Sorry for the lame show.” 

</p><p>Kitou, watching the scene unfold from behind, apologized, but there’s no need for that. 

</p><p>“To be honest, I thought the students in A Class would be more stiff. I’m surprised to see that’s not the case.” 

</p><p>“For better or worse, Hashimoto always acts like the mood-maker.” 

</p><p>I don’t know if he’s complimenting Hashimoto or not, but he used that strange expression with an unchanging scary face.
