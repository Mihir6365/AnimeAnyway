    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
It is Friday after school, the day after the special exam was announced.

</p><p>There hasn't been a class-wide discussion or any particular action regarding the exams since the talk during lunch yesterday.

</p><p>Since Horikita is the class leader, one would think that she has made progress in her strategy and approach for this Special Exam, but details are unclear. 

</p><p>There is no sign of her seeking an appointment with me. 

</p><p>With still a week to go, there's no need to rush. 

</p><p>I'd prefer her to take her time and contemplate.

</p><p>“Ayanokoji-kun ...... Um, can I have a moment with you?”

</p><p>I was getting ready to leave the classroom by myself when Mii chan called out to me. 

</p><p>This weekend, Kei has plans to hang out with her friends until the evening, so she was already out of sight. 

</p><p>So now I'm completely free. I can take my time without hesitation. 

</p><p>“What is it?”

</p><p>“The classroom might not be the best place... I'd prefer to talk somewhere else, if possible.”

</p><p>Although there were no students who seemed to be listening to us, Mii chan doesn't seem to feel at ease here.

</p><p>Judging from the situation, I wonder if the content of the conversation is a bit serious.

</p><p>“Understood. Can we talk on the way home?”

</p><p>“Of course, that's fine.”

</p><p>There's no reason to stay in the classroom, so I grabbed my bag and immediately started moving.

</p><p>There's no need to go to a deserted place on purpose.

</p><p>Students are rushing around after school, whether it's in the hallways or at the door. 

</p><p>There are lots of students here, and there's a lot of noise.

</p><p>“So what do you have to say to me?”

</p><p>When I urged her to do so, Mii-chan briefly looked around her, just to be sure, and then began to speak, seemingly feeling relieved.

</p><p>“Do you remember when I stopped going to school before? ...It was a pathetic story, but it was about Hirata-kun… um...regarding that…”

</p><p>It was during the Unanimous Special Exam when Kushida revealed Mii-chan's crush, around late September.

</p><p>“Was something wrong during that time?”

</p><p>“While I couldn't go outside, there was someone who delivered food for me.”

</p><p>“Oh, I remember. They brought something for you every day.”

</p><p>I remembered when I was questioned about being the person delivering food to Mii-chan.

</p><p>“I've brought this up to you previously, Ayanokoji-kun, and I'm hoping to get your help…”

</p><p>“I understand...”

</p><p>Though a considerable amount of time had passed, the fact that she was bringing up the subject again indicated—

“Have you discovered who it was?”

</p><p>“Um, not yet, but I believe we can find out if we try...”

</p><p>“We can find out if we try?”

</p><p>Mii-chan nodded and started talking slowly.

</p><p>Even though she had mustered the courage to return to school, it appeared that Mii-chan still harboured concerns about the person who had supported her. 

</p><p>I had assumed she had given up on the matter, but her persistence indicated otherwise; she wanted to express her gratitude.

</p><p>To Find the Person, Two hints were present. 

</p><p>The first was a note found inside a bag of groceries, containing only the room number, suggesting it was intended for Mii-chan.

</p><p>If the handwriting was unique, it might offer a vital tip. 

</p><p>Unfortunately, there was a curveball to this. 

</p><p>Mii-chan had brought the paper for me to see, but it was intentionally written in a way that made it impossible to identify the writer.

</p><p>“The individual behind these gifts seems quite cunning.”

</p><p>“Yes, Indeed.”

</p><p>There was just one more way to look for proof.

</p><p>It was evident that all the food items were bought from the convenience store.

</p><p>Mii-chan had meticulously recorded each item she received.

</p><p>This indicated that we could provide descriptions of these items to the store clerk and determine if any students had bought identical items.

</p><p>It was customary to approach the convenience store employees in an attempt to determine who had given the present. But over time, their memory will eventually fade, underscoring the urgency of taking immediate action.

</p><p>I had assumed that Mii-chan wouldn't have taken this step, but I was taken aback by her response.

</p><p>“I actually tried discussing it with the convenience store clerk as soon as I returned to school.”

</p><p>Unfortunately, the outcome wasn't favourable. 

</p><p>The clerk Mii-chan approached had recently started working at the convenience store and wasn't present when the purchases were made by the gift-giver.

</p><p>Additionally, the person who would have been on duty at that time had been transferred to another store.

</p><p>A detective might consider reviewing surveillance footage, but that wasn't an option available to me.

</p><p>“I tried asking the girls on my floor about it, but they didn’t know anything. That’s when I decided to give up for a while.”

</p><p>When there were no leads, an ordinary student like her was left with limited options.

</p><p>“I suppose you didn't have much of a choice.”

</p><p>“Yeah...”

</p><p>And so, time passed with the details remaining elusive. 

</p><p>However, some unexpected information came to Mii-chan, who found herself at a dead end.

</p><p>During a recent visit to the convenience store for shopping, a clerk called out to her. 

</p><p>By chance, the clerk who had been transferred and the current clerk working at the school crossed paths. 

</p><p>The clerk remembered Mii-chan's concern and explained it to him. 

</p><p>Unexpectedly, because the incident occurred just before the transfer, he recalled a student who might be relevant. 

</p><p>Consequently, the clerk apparently attempted to inform Mii-chan of the student's name, as per the manager's instructions. However—

“I was taken aback, or rather, I was startled by the unexpected news, so I said I'd return later to hear the details and hurriedly left.”

</p><p>“You left?”

</p><p>“I... I left…”

</p><p>Only Mii-chan could explain why she reacted that way in that particular situation.

</p><p>“By the way, when did you find out about this?”

</p><p>“Um... well…”

</p><p>Her obvious struggle in answering indicated that it wasn’t very recent.

</p><p>“...Today marks the sixth day.”

</p><p>“You've been avoiding this for quite some time.”

</p><p>“I... have been avoiding it…”

</p><p>She blushed with embarrassment, or rather, shame at her own weakness.

</p><p>“I think I should go soon, but... I'm nervous... If I don't know who it is, I can just pretend to ignore it. But once I find out, I can't pretend anymore. Most importantly, the person who gave the gifts hasn't come forward, so there's a chance they don't want it to be known, right?”

</p><p>She probably always wanted to thank whoever had given her the gift, even if she didn't know who it was from. 

</p><p>Due to not knowing who the person was, she believed there was nothing she could do about it.

</p><p>With each passing day, this conviction may have grown stronger.

</p><p>“Well, that's understandable.”

</p><p>They had supported Mii-chan from behind the scenes without disclosing their identity. 

</p><p>It wouldn't be surprising if they had valid reasons for wanting to remain anonymous.

</p><p>“What reasons might those be?”

</p><p>“There could be various reasons.”

</p><p>Given the limited information available, it would be difficult to pinpoint the exact motives.

</p><p>“Although, I'm certain they're a classmate... I don't have many friends, but I doubt they'd keep it a secret from me. I can't understand why…”

</p><p>Mii-chan appeared to be contemplating which of her friends it could be. 

</p><p>Naturally, it seemed unlikely for a stranger to send a gift.

</p><p>“That's just one possibility— No, forget it.”

</p><p>“What is it? Please, tell me.”

</p><p>I hesitated, considering it might be overwhelming for her, but Mii-chan was eager to know.

</p><p>“Please, tell me.” 

</p><p>She urged again, so I decided to proceed.

</p><p>“I apologize for challenging your assumptions, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a classmate. While the reason for your absence wasn't known, it wasn't difficult for others to find out.”

</p><p>“But I hardly interact with students from other classes…”

</p><p>“That doesn't matter much. A close relationship isn't a requirement. And it doesn't have to be a girl.”

</p><p>“Huh, what?”

</p><p>She appeared stunned, especially considering she had even less interaction with boys.

</p><p>“Let me be direct, there could be, for instance, a boy who harbours secret feelings for you, right? It's possible that he became concerned when his crush was absent and decided to send a gift.”

</p><p>“Eh!? What!?”

</p><p>She was visibly taken aback, trying to maintain composure but inadvertently attracting attention. 

</p><p>Realizing this, she quickly regulated her breathing but remained visibly flustered.

</p><p>“It's just one possibility, no need to be flustered.”

</p><p>It wasn't necessarily the case; I was simply presenting a potential, albeit unexpected, scenario.

</p><p>“W— w— we— wel— well, yes, you're right!?”

</p><p>However, she was far from composed.

</p><p>I suppose it was an assumption I shouldn't have made.

</p><p>“Let's refocus. It's important to hear your decision, don't you agree?”

</p><p>Even though I had a good understanding of her thought process, I felt it would be best to hear it directly from Mii-chan.

</p><p>“I'm unsure what to do at this point. Should I try to find out who it is? Should I express my gratitude?”

</p><p>“It's crucial to make a decision now.”

</p><p>Mii-chan nodded hesitantly, lacking confidence.

</p><p>“What would you do in this situation, Ayanokoji-kun?”

</p><p>“What would I do, hmm...?”

</p><p>After considering it for a moment, I decided to answer honestly.

</p><p>“I'm not entirely certain if it'll make a difference, but if it were me, I'd want to know their identity. Then, I'd determine whether or not to approach them.”

</p><p>“So you're implying there's a chance you might not thank them even if you found out who they were?”

</p><p>“That's just my perspective. Like in the previous scenario, if the person had no connection to me, I might hesitate. And there are situations where it's wiser not to reveal that you've been investigating, right?”

</p><p>“I suppose that makes sense.”

</p><p>They had discreetly assisted someone they cared about. 

</p><p>If she were to express gratitude after discovering their identity at the store, it would come as a shock. 

</p><p>This applied even without romantic implications.

</p><p>“When the other party wishes to maintain secrecy, it becomes even more complicated.”

</p><p>“...Yes.”

</p><p>“Moreover, whether you can keep the information to yourself after learning the person's identity is another matter. Based on what I've observed, I don't believe this approach suits you, Mii-chan.”

</p><p>“That's... Yes…”

</p><p>If she knew the answer, she'd likely struggle to conceal her emotions.

</p><p>“It's not necessarily a negative thing to let go”

</p><p>“Even so…”

</p><p>Yet, Mii-chan struggles with guilt for her inability to express gratitude to the individual who aided her. 

</p><p>She finds herself once again confronted with the emotions she had attempted to suppress. 

</p><p>Even if she opts not to uncover their identity, those sentiments will likely remain.

</p><p>“Once you open Pandora's Box, you can't close it.”

</p><p>Given Mii-chan's emotional vulnerability, it's understandable why she chose to retreat.

</p><p>Furthermore, there's a silver lining in her decision not to unveil their identity.

</p><p>Discovering the mysterious supporter’s identity will undoubtedly alter perceptions, regardless of who they turn out to be.

</p><p>“I…”

</p><p>The troubled Mii-chan hesitated before responding.

</p><p>“I... I want to know…”

</p><p>“Even though it might result in regret?”

</p><p>“...Yes.”

</p><p>With her decision made, there was little to no room for me to object.

</p><p>“Then you should head to the convenience store.”

</p><p>Despite my suggestion, Mii-chan still seemed unsure, glancing in my direction.

</p><p>“...”

</p><p>“...”

</p><p>An awkward tension hung in the air, but Mii-chan's intentions were clear.

</p><p>“Shall we go to the convenience store together?”

</p><p>“C-Can we?”

</p><p>Despite mentally preparing herself to uncover the truth, she seemed unable to face it alone.

</p><p>“I can accompany you. If it helps you find some courage, I think it's worth it.”

</p><p>“Th... Thank you, Ayanokoji-kun!”

</p><p>With the firmest nod she could muster, Mii-chan and I made our way to the convenience store.
