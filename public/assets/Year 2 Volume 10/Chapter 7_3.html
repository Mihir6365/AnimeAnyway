    <h3>Part 3</h3><p>
After school. It’s already 5 p.m. Club activities were halted for today because of the special test held for the 2nd Year students, so there are very few students remaining inside the school.

</p><p>Sakayanagi is sitting down on Kamuro’s seat, which still hasn’t been carried away, and waiting for the time.

</p><p>It was finally time for the rendezvous, and the classroom’s door was opened.

</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you, Hashimoto-kun.”

</p><p>“Why are we meeting at a place like this, and why are we alone together?”

</p><p>“This is an evaluation meeting.”

</p><p>“Things are going to get a bit scary, then.”

</p><p>“The results of this special test ended up being extremely unfortunate. This is my blunder.”

</p><p>“It really was unfortunate, but nobody would blame you, Princess. Because nobody thinks that it was anything other than simply information being leaked out to Ryuen.”

</p><p>Hashimoto lighty put his hand on Kamuro’s desk and looked around the classroom.

</p><p>“Because of the betrayer, Masumi-chan… Kamuro-chan is going to be expelled. I can’t forgive that.”

</p><p>“I thought you were the type who wouldn’t care about anyone else being expelled, as long as you were safe.”

</p><p>“We still fought together for 2 years, y’know? Of course I’m gonna feel mad about this too.”

</p><p>“Indeed. However, how do you think class information was leaked outside?”

</p><p>Sakayanagi asked Hashimoto, looking for his opinion.

</p><p>“Normally, I’d say they used a phone to send information. It’s simple and effective.”

</p><p>“I think the same way too.”

</p><p>“Wait, then why didn’t you do anything when Morishita spoke up?”

</p><p>“Like what? Take everyone’s phones away?”

</p><p>“Of course. We wouldn’t get hurt this badly if you did that, right?”

</p><p>“I’m sure the betrayer is no idiot. They must have had one or two counter-measures in place. I decided it would create too much disarray if I started clumsily looking for a culprit.”

</p><p>“So you anticipated ahead and stayed calm. That’s the kind of leadership only you can display.”

</p><p>Hhashimoto slowly walked between the lined up desks and turned around after reaching the teacher’s platform.

</p><p>“...Still, Hime-san, I know it was by lottery, but didn’t you feel bad about removing Kamuro-chan?”

</p><p>“Feel bad?”

</p><p>“She’s your ally, isn’t she? If it was me, I’d do my best to expel someone instead.”

</p><p>“It’s nothing like that for me. She isn’t anyone special.”

</p><p>“You’re pretty strong not to be swayed, even though you suffered and felt joy together for two years. I relatively liked Kamuro-chan, so I think it will take me some time to get over this.”

</p><p>Indeed, there was something complex in Hashimoto’s expression as he replied from some distance away.

</p><p>“Who do you think is the betrayer that was the origin of Masumi-san’s expulsion?”

</p><p>“So many questions. Unfortunately, I have no idea. Do you have any guesses, Hime-san?”

</p><p>Sakayanagi laughed, and quietly pushed her seat to stand up using her cane.
</p><p>Then, she signalled for Hashimoto to come closer.

</p><p>Hashimoto stepped away from the teacher’s platform and returned to Sakayanagi’s side.

</p><p>“It’s you, isn’t it, Hashimoto-kun? You’re the one who leaked inside information.”

</p><p>After that question, Hashimoto scratched his head and breathed a heavy sigh.

</p><p>“I knew you’d say that the moment you called me here, because you’re right to suspect me. I’m sure you already know about this, but I’m constantly looking for a way to transfer to a different class. I can admit that this is what I’ve been doing. But, do you think I’d do something to lose my position while I’m in Class-A? Doesn’t that sound strange?”

</p><p>He admitted it was natural for him to be blamed, but firmly denied.

</p><p>“Normally, you would be right. Even I thought there would be no such blatant betrayal.”

</p><p>It’s difficult to imagine a student based in Class-A undertaking such an inexplicable act that would threaten themselves.

</p><p>Even Sakayanagi, with her attention to detail, cannot fight while keeping something like a betrayal in her mind.

</p><p>“I won’t do anything to harm the class. Why would the most likely guy to be blamed betray the class?”

</p><p>Hashimoto explained that he would not betray the class, because of all the attention already on him.

</p><p>“I’ll help you find the betrayer too. I’ll also prove my innocence that way.”

</p><p>“I should ask you for some help right away, then.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi pulled out her phone and put it on top of Kamuro’s table.

</p><p>It was an image of Hashimoto walking with Ryuen in Keyaki Mall.

</p><p>“You were in contact with him before this special test, weren’t you?”

</p><p>“It was Ryuen who approached me. He just dragged me along with him after that.”

</p><p>Hashimoto explained that he didn’t want to go with Ryuen either.

</p><p>“Who the hell took that photo? Maybe it was your employee Yamamura, huh?”

</p><p>He quickly asked back without waiting for Sakayanagi’s words, with the implication of a counterattack.

</p><p>“Let’s end this charade already, shall we?”

</p><p>Sakayanagi replied to a Hashimoto in denial in an unchanging voice of tone.

</p><p>“You’re never gonna believe me anyway, right?”

</p><p>“If you’re going to continue your vindication, may I see your phone history?”

</p><p>She replied to his explanation by calling it vindication. It’s clear that Sakayanagi’s suspicions are very strong.

</p><p>“Will that make you believe I’m clean?”

</p><p>“We’ll see about that. It might be worth giving it a try.”

</p><p>“Yeah, it’s faster to leave a phone call on if you’re going to send information during the test. That, or send messages in secret. So anyone with a history of these will be the betrayer. Are you sure you wanna do this, though? You’re going to owe me a fitting apology if nothing comes out after checking my phone.”

</p><p>Hashimoto emphazised that this won’t end with one or two words after he was blamed so much.

</p><p>“I will do as you expect if I end up being wrong. However, I am not looking for a phone call or chat history. You can easily delete those.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto had plenty of time to be alone after school. It would be a simple thing to delete his history then.

</p><p>“Why did you say you want to check my history, then?” 

</p><p>“The history I would like to see is your private point history.” 

</p><p>Will you say yes now? Hashimoto’s voice choked after that implication. 

</p><p>“While you seem careless, you actually have a prudent personality. There’s no proof Ryuen wouldn’t entrap you even after you joined hands. You would be at risk of expulsion if you got eliminated. You might want to have a written contract in order to protect yourself, but you would want to avoid this in order to not leave any proof behind. In which case, it wouldn’t be a strange proposal to receive a large amount of private points as a guarantee instead, would it? You can return it all after the contract is fulfilled. If not, you’ll have the private points. With that, unless something extraordinary happens, you wouldn’t betray each other, right?” 

</p><p>Hashimoto squeezed the phone he pulled out and bitterly smiled. 

</p><p>“Wow. I guess it’s not so easy to pull one over you. I admit it, I give up.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi’s point was on mark. 

</p><p>Hashimoto temporarily took hold of a large amount of private points collected from Ryuen’s classmates. 

</p><p>As a guarantee, in case he is eliminated. 

</p><p>“How much did you get from him?” 

</p><p>“The information fee wasn’t that high. Just 50,000.”

</p><p>“That’s a cheap price for betrayal.”

</p><p>“I wanted to limit it with that. I’m not worried about private points, and that’s not the reason for my betrayal.”

</p><p>Hashimoto emphasized that private points weren’t his main objective.

</p><p>One would expect Sakayanagi to immediately pursue the truth, but she won’t do that.

</p><p>Because she already knows the reason for Hashimoto’s betrayal.

</p><p>“I suppose I should compliment Ryuen-kun for making you betray us here.”

</p><p>“Don’t make me laugh. I’m the one who approached him with this. He’s the one I chose to share information with, because he’s a guy who won’t have a problem with an act of betrayal and easily accepts it if it benefits him. I couldn’t do this with Horikita or Ichinose, right?”

</p><p>“Yeah, even if you claim that you will share information as an insider, whether the leader of another class will believe you or not is a different issue. I suppose he is the only one who would easily accept.”

</p><p>“Yeah. That’s why I bet on a 2/3 chance for today’s special test.”

</p><p>Hashimoto is saying that if Class-A was positioned diagonally without a line of attack and defense between it and the Ryuen Class, he would have simply watched from the side without forcing anything. 

</p><p>That alone would have greatly changed things. 

</p><p>The fight might have ended according to the way it was going during the first half. 

</p><p>“Don’t you want to scold me at least a little?” 

</p><p>“I am not a teacher. I don’t care about trying to guide you towards the right path.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto frowned and put his phone in his pocket.

</p><p>“Why didn’t you at least search me?” 

</p><p>“That’s pointless. There was nothing suspicious left on your phone, was there? It’s too risky to do spy-work using your own phone. In which case, you probably borrowed someone else’s phone beforehand and secretly placed it somewhere in the classroom, didn’t you?”

</p><p>“You can predict that far?” 

</p><p>“There’s no point in trying to test me.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto tried to score a point, but he quickly faced Sakayanagi’s rebuttal.

</p><p>If he was a target of suspicion as he pointed out, he was intending on unhesitatingly offering up his own phone.

</p><p>There wouldn’t be any proof then even if Sakayanagi searched everyone’s phones. 

</p><p>Sakayanagi knew this would only be a waste of time, and decided to allow the students to continue using their phones for defense. 

</p><p>The feeling that the people around were in a hurry was simply a premature assumption. 

</p><p>“The hiding spot is limited to inside the classroom, but it would take time and work to find it. Besides, if someone feigned ignorance and started a commotion, claiming that there might be a spy in the corridor, they could also destroy the proof by using that opportunity to take the phone outside.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi can’t do anything agile like catch a culprit during a crime in progress, thanks to her bad leg.

</p><p>Hashimoto would have shown no hesitation if she started whispering Kamuro or Kitou.

</p><p>“You left the classroom with Yoshida-kun, whom you aren’t very close with, after the special test was over. Did you hide it in his bag?”

</p><p>“Wow, you see everything, Princess. Does that mean you were always especially suspicious of me?”

</p><p>“It made sense, considering your recent remarks.”

</p><p>“But why? Why didn’t you tell me to show you my private point history when I entered the classroom, and instead tried to get me to confess?” 

</p><p>Sakayanagi didn’t push right away when Hashimoto first showed up in the classroom.

</p><p>It would be a different story if she hadn’t determined his guilt yet, but she was clearly confident.

</p><p>“It’s a show of mercy for the betrayer. Including the fact you didn’t confess during the test.”

</p><p>That’s why Sakayanagi gave him time to confess for a second time. 

</p><p>She wanted him to reflect on his own actions. 

</p><p>“It’s a shame you didn’t notice. I could let it go as playing with fire if you were simply in contact with another class to plot for a transfer, but this crosses the line.”

</p><p>“Yeah. This goes for most special tests, but ‘being betrayed by your allies’ is a critical blow. All students in a class share the same destiny. So, even if they complain, or refuse to obey orders, they don’t betray the class. Because that would be disadvantageous for the class, and by extension, themselves.”

</p><p>That’s why even the students who are displeased are holding back and going through each day with patience.

</p><p>“You crossed that uncrossable line.” 

</p><p>“I don’t deny it.”

</p><p>Hashimoto quickly confirmed that truth to Sakayanagi without any fear. 

</p><p>“I’m sure others won’t understand. What’s the benefit in entrapping Class-A, they’ll say. But they’re wrong, this class has no chance of winning in the first place. It’s already certain that it will fall down to Class-B or below in the future. So I had to make my own chance for victory, even if I had to betray the class.”

</p><p>“You’re saying this is your own way of fighting?”

</p><p>“It wasn’t easy for me either. But, I liked the idea of giving a warning in this special test. There’s no despair in losing class points either. Eliminations would only result in an untalented student being erased. I thought this was a great chance. I don’t want to entrap this class. I temporarily betrayed it, because I want it to win.”

</p><p>“And you were ready to be found out. Rather, it was part of your plan, wasn’t it?”

</p><p>“I never thought it would be today, though.” 

</p><p>A gathering of the entire class, or something close to that. 

</p><p>That’s the scenario he imagined.

</p><p>Hashimoto wanted to avoid being cornered in a 1 on 1 situation, if possible.

</p><p>“You already knew the reason when you figured that I was the betrayer, didn’t you?”

</p><p>“That’s why I chose this place as the setting.”

</p><p>She took a big gamble while exposing herself to danger. 

</p><p>This is the reason why.

</p><p>“This is what I had to do in order to make you take me seriously. I already advised you again and again by the end of the winter holiday too, didn’t I? I told you I wanted you to pull Ayanokoji into our class.” 

</p><p>“Yes. I’ve heard fervent speech all too many times.”

</p><p>A betrayal to make Sakayanagi pull in Ayanokoji.

</p><p>The other students may simply tilt their heads in confusion if they hear this.

</p><p>But Hashimoto knows. 

</p><p>He knows Sakayanagi Arisu’s true nature, her personality.

</p><p>“I decided that I would be fine with it even if we lose class points, even if I become a betrayer, and even if there is an expulsion. I’m going to force you to listen. That’s what I was ready to do.”

</p><p>This isn’t the end, but the beginning.

</p><p>A threat to betray the class many times until Sakayanagi says she will take Ayanokoji in.

</p><p>“It seems that you believe you cannot graduate in Class-A while under my leadership.”

</p><p>“I will admit that you’re excellent. But, in the nearby future, I’m certain that you will be unable to halt the Ayanokoji Class’s rapid advance. Class-A and Class-B will switch places one day, and we will have no chance of a comeback afterwards. In other words, it’s a delusion to believe we can keep our current rank.”

</p><p>Then, he passionately continued.

</p><p>“The most effective strategy for graduating in Class-A. This is to have you and Ayanokoji in the same class. This will create a class that will never be defeated.”

</p><p>“I’m glad I didn’t let you say those things before a large crowd.”

</p><p>“You won’t admit it? I think what I’m saying makes sense.” 

</p><p>“I will not admit it.”

</p><p>“Sorry, but Ayanokoji is definitely the strongest-” 

</p><p>“What do you even know about Ayanokoji-kun?” 

</p><p>Thunk! 

</p><p>She firmly hit the floor with the tip of her cane.

</p><p>“..!”

</p><p>Despite being calm so far, Sakayanagi clearly displayed her anger.

</p><p>“It seems you’re quite obsessed with him, but can you see how delusional you sound?”

</p><p>Hashimoto was overwhelmed under this unusual pressure by Sakayanagi despite her tiny frame. 

</p><p>“Are you angry that I’m saying you’re not the best?” 

</p><p>Indeed, this was what made  Sakayanagi angry.

</p><p>Not because he judged Ayanokoji to be superior to her, however.

</p><p>It was just hard to forgive the man before her for showing such a large degree of arbitrary obsession with Ayanokoji.

</p><p>How could an ordinary person like him, who knows nothing about Ayanokoji’s origins, talk this way about him? 

</p><p>“You should throw your pride away and take Ayanokoji in. It will be terrible if Ryuen gets him instead.”

</p><p>“There’s a 0 possibility of Ryuen poaching Ayanokoji-kun. If Ayanokoji-kun does possess the talent you think he does, I think he will rather continue opposing him as an enemy to defeat.” 

</p><p>“That may be true for now. But what if he gets into a situation with no chance of victory? If he keeps opposing him and ends up having to let Class-A go, then his thinking may-”

</p><p>“No, he won't change his way of thinking. Both Ryuen-kun and I want to fight worthy opponents. Neither of us are particularly concerned about the 'Class-A graduation' part.”

</p><p>Hashimoto closed his eyes and sighed. 

</p><p>He realized his words were incorrect. 

</p><p>The meaning behind Sakayanagi’s attitude now, something which she had never shown before.

</p><p>Even before Hashimoto noticed, Sakayanagi had always valued Ayanokoji highly.

</p><p>At the same time, he understood again that Ayanokoji’s talent was without a doubt the real thing.

</p><p>“Maybe that’s the part of you I’ve grown tired of. When I first enrolled in this school, I sensed that either you or Ryuen would be the leader to graduate in Class-A with. But, I always felt something strange. Now I can see why. It was because you guys were never really enthusiastic about graduating in Class-A.”

</p><p>Becoming Class-A is simply the result of beating her rivals.

</p><p>If she found something to put more precedence on than graduating in Class-A, she can calmly abandon the latter.

</p><p>“On the other hand, Horikita and Ichinose do have that enthusiasm. It’s a strange thing, huh? The classes that don’t have the talent to win have that enthusiasm, while the classes that actually do have the talent to win don’t. None of that shit matters if you and Ayanokoji come together, though. It’ll be the birth of the class that will win.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi looked with cold eyes at Hashimoto convincing himself, and spoke.

</p><p>“I understand that you want to say taking Ayanokoji into your own class is a definite condition for victory. However, in that case, wouldn’t it be simpler to win a transfer ticket and move to the class of someone who is fixated on Class-A, like Horikita-san? In other words, Ayanokoji’s class.”

</p><p>“Do you think I’ve been in a position where I could do that?” 

</p><p>“Of course. If you had begged me to give you a transfer ticket when you had an opportunity in the future, I would have gladly given it to you.” 

</p><p>“I regret not doing so, then.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto displayed regret in an unlikely manner, but Sakayanagi quickly pointed something out.

</p><p>“You jest. I’m sure you wouldn’t have accepted the ticket in that situation.”

</p><p>“...Why is that?”

</p><p>“I can see right through you. While you feel uncertain about the future, you don’t want to throw away your position in Class-A.  But you’re afraid of Ayanokoji-kun. You want to transfer classes, but there’s nothing to guarantee your future after transferring to Class-B. That’s why you won’t move with a ticket. And you’re not going to move, then you have to move someone else.” 

</p><p>One cannot easily trust a student who keeps yapping about class transfers.

</p><p>The hurdle of getting a ticket will become far harder than it is now.

</p><p>He would lose his way to escape from the sinking boat in case of a disaster.

</p><p>“I do not intend on keeping a betrayer like you in my class. You know you can’t run away now even if you try, right? I’m sure you’ve made all sorts of negotiations, in your own way, but 20,000,000 points have no value for you. Nobody will pick you up in earnest. Even if you try to acquire a class transfer ticket, as long as I control Class-A, I will never allow you to. Of course,  I will also not poach Ayanokoji-kun either.”

</p><p>In other words, Hashimoto currently has no way out. But he won’t pull back. Hashimoto has been determined from the moment he decided to betray the class.

</p><p>“I wanted you to agree the first time, but I guess it can’t be helped. I’m going to keep doing this. I’m going to convince you and force you to poach Ayanokoji.”

</p><p>This is Hashimoto’s big gamble.

</p><p>He will be in a predicament if a scenario where the class becomes one and expels one person comes along again.

</p><p>Otherwise, however, Sakayanagi cannot simply drive Hashimoto to expulsion.

</p><p>“Special tests aren’t the only way of expelling someone. You understand, don’t you?”

</p><p>“Are you saying you will never comply? Then, at worst, I will have no choice but to expel you. Then, I will take control of Class-A and poach Ayanokoji.” 

</p><p>Sakayanagi dryly clapped after a remark that could be considered a complete farewell.

</p><p>“You spoke well. This is the brightest you’ve shun today. If you say you’re going to expel me, then I will welcome it. Please show me you can do it.”

</p><p>A complete breakdown inside the class.

</p><p>A new battle that will not be concluded until one side is defeated opens its curtains.
