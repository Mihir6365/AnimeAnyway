    <h3>Part 1</h3>

    <p>
        Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the same day, a male student shoved an empty cup into a trash can set up outside the
        Keyaki Mall, when a female student appeared, glaring at the person in question.

    </p>
    <p>Since both students are in the same class, the boy raised his hand.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, Masumi-chan. You’ve arrived earlier than I thought.”

    </p>
    <p>“Umm, can you stop calling me that? Also, please don’t call me out on a vacation day.”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t say that. I came here with some interesting information today.”

    </p>
    <p>“I know you love gathering information, but don’t wrap me up in it.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s mean. It’s some very beneficial information, you know?”

    </p>
    <p>“Report it to Sakayanagi and earn some points or something, then.”

    </p>
    <p>“I considered a lot of things. You’re the only one in our class I can talk honestly with.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s a lie, isn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not a lie. At least you can also give your opinion to <a class="tooltip"
            data-tooltip="Hime-san mean princess in Japanese.">Hime-san</a>
        without fear.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto replied that he appreciates this point.

    </p>
    <p>“So? It doesn’t have anything to do with my real intentions, does it? I hate how arbitrary you are.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto did not seem bothered by having this told to him so clearly, and tried to continue the conversation.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, just hear me out. Let me tell you what I heard.”

    </p>
    <p>Saying that, Hashimoto then told her that he had overheard a group of people talking in Keyaki Mall during the
        day.

    </p>
    <p>He then began to explain the story, supplementing it with his own words also based on the truth he recorded with
        his phone.

    </p>
    <p>It was about the topic that the eight students including Sudou gathered to talk about.

    </p>
    <p>After listening to it all, Kamuro, who had no interest in the subject, expressed a change.

    </p>
    <p>“So? Interesting story, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I already knew about all that, to an extent.”

    </p>
    <p>“The nucleus of the B Class. It’s not Horikita, after all. The glimpse he showed us on the Uninhabited Island,
        and the strange events up until this point. The Unanimous Test was a lot more extreme behind the scenes than you
        can imagine. It’s not easy to cut off a girl you’ve been friends with for a long time, and who was in the same
        group as you, is it? This means he can be extremely ruthless. She looked ordinary, but she was still cute.”

    </p>
    <p>“Does it matter what she looked like?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course it does. If Sakura was an ugly girl, I wouldn’t really think much about it. Whether one looks good or
        bad changes things a lot.”

    </p>
    <p>Although she did not agree with Hashimoto’s opinion, she did understand the first part of his story.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokouji is a man who can make ruthless decisions based solely on his own interests, regardless of whether he
        is close with the person or not. Right?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s what I’m saying. Further, I think you’d get it if you heard them talk, but Ayanokouji was certainly not
        in a high caste in the class at the stage of the Unanimous Special Test. It’s a herculean task for someone like
        that to seize the class and take charge.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto securely locked and saved the recording on his phone so as not to erase it by mistake.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way, I’ve been curious about something…”

    </p>
    <p>“What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“How did you manage to listen in on such an important conversation?”

    </p>
    <p>“Just a simple coincidence. I was lucky.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto unhesitatingly replied so, but Kamuro did not believe him in the slightest.

    </p>
    <p>“Coincidence, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto’s audio recording began when the members of Horikita Class were gathering at the cafe.

    </p>
    <p>They were more likely to be just making idle chit-chat, so there was no way he could have foreseen that they were
        going to have an important discussion.

    </p>
    <p>Even if he was gathering information at random, how could there be such a convenient coincidence?

    </p>
    <p>“What? Are you doubting that it was a coincidence?”

    </p>
    <p>“Whatever. I’m not going to ask if you don’t want to talk about it. We can just say it’s a coincidence, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro decided that it was wiser not to get too deep into this matter and did not pry into it.

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto also made no move to answer Kamuro’s question.

    </p>
    <p>“So? It’s certainly interesting information, but what's the point in knowing this beyond that?”

    </p>
    <p>“Before coming to a conclusion, if it is confirmed that Ayanokouji isn’t normal, then I’m curious about when,
        where, and what he has been doing until his enrollment. Since he enrolled, Ryuuen, who was always violent, has
        become meek and it seems like he’s been involved with Ayanokouji a lot recently. Right?”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto let Kamuro hear the assumptions and the expectations that he came up with after skillfully weaving
        together the truths he already knew.

    </p>
    <p>“...Ryuuen fought with Ayanokouji who was hiding behind Horikita… and lost?”

    </p>
    <p>“Ryuuen is not the type to be obsessed with just one win or loss. If this trend is correct, it’s not just a
        simple defeat. In which case, he lost to Ayanokouji in a way that showed a considerable difference in strength.”

    </p>
    <p>“If that’s the case, why did he get involved with Ayanokouji after that? Aiming for revenge?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m sure he has that in mind as well. However, I think Ayanokouji’s personality may also be involved. If he
        thinks he can gain an advantage by getting involved, it would be better to have him as an ally than to see him
        as an enemy the whole time, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“So he’s using him to his advantage, huh? I guess that’s what you’d expect from Ryuuen, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Even if he loses, he won’t just go down. He does not let go when he bites into something.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s that too, but depending on the case, this is more than that.”

    </p>
    <p>“More than that?”

    </p>
    <p>“Ryuuen is probably using him for his own benefit, but the truth is that Ayanokouji is definitely aware of it.
        It’s like he’s challenging him to try to use him.”

    </p>
    <p>“What? I get that supporting Horikita from the shadows is a meaningful way to improve the class, but…”

    </p>
    <p>“Who knows? Maybe he wants to let Ryuuen crush Ichinose or Sakayanagi by helping him. Ayanokouji isn’t the type
        to stand up and fight, so it makes sense for him to rely on someone belligerent like Ryuuen, doesn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, maybe.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’ve suspected it for a long time now, but the thick fog has finally lifted a little bit. The most troublesome
        enemy in Horikita Class is Ayanokouji, and…”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto hesitated to speak just for a moment, but continued.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokouji’s true ability is on an even higher level than Hime-san’s.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you really sure about that?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. I’m not going to say ‘probably’ or ‘maybe’ any more. I confirmed that with the discussion today.”

    </p>
    <p>No matter who the target is, one usually can’t overestimate them this much.

    </p>
    <p>“If you’re right, we’re in a pretty big pinch.”

    </p>
    <p>“It is what it is. More importantly, I expect that a large amount of points will be moved around at the final
        test waiting for us at the end of the third term. We won’t be able to escape if we lose to Ryuuen.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto said something that no one in A Class would ever say. Kamuro was a bit annoyed by this and glared at
        him.

    </p>
    <p>The confrontation with the class in which Ayanokouji is based is still not determined.

    </p>
    <p>Even if they do eventually meet, it is possible that it will be some time in the future.

    </p>
    <p>The first thing to worry about is the final test at the end of the third term.

    </p>
    <p>“You think that you’re going to lose to Ryuuen there, don’t you? That’s why you’re worried about the future of A
        Class. Maybe you even want to lose?”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think I want to lose. Rather, Masumi-chan would get really mad at a statement like that.”

    </p>
    <p>She knew that Hashimoto did not trust Sakayanagi, but she was still surprised.

    </p>
    <p>However, that’s not the part that made Kamuro angry.

    </p>
    <p>“I just don’t like your negative thinking. You always assume the same thing, don’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>“I won’t deny that I have negative thoughts, but it’s not a bad thing to assume you’re going to lose and be ready
        for it.”

    </p>
    <p>You never know what kind of reversals or loopholes there might be in this school.

    </p>
    <p>“You make assumptions, and what then? All you can do is put your mind at ease, isn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro, who has concluded that this is a futile move, is tired of the negative comments that are repeated every
        time.

    </p>
    <p>“Please don’t say that. You’re the only one I can talk about this with.”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh…”

    </p>
    <p>Although she is used by Sakayanagi, Kamuro has not given him her heart as well.

    </p>
    <p>She complains if there’s something she doesn’t like, and depending on the circumstances, even refuses him without
        holding back.

    </p>
    <p>That’s what Sakayanagi liked about her, and it was the same for Hashimoto.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s a good thing to put your mind at ease, you know?”

    </p>
    <p>He joked back, but it was nothing but one of the side-effects.

    </p>
    <p>“Sure, if you’re going to stay in the same class.”

    </p>
    <p>By adding that remark, there is a different meaning added onto the negative thinking.

    </p>
    <p>“If you’re talking about a class transfer ticket, it’s a risky gamble. It’s not like they’re going to give it to
        the class that lost too, and even if we do get one by the end of the school year, there’s only a short window of
        opportunity to use it anyway.”

    </p>
    <p>Although they seem to be all-powerful, class transfer tickets aren’t actually that powerful.

    </p>
    <p>The higher the class, the less advantageous it is to move to a lower class.

    </p>
    <p>“Even if you lose in the worst case scenario you assumed, you’d just be following the crowd at worst. Even if you
        luckily get a class transfer ticket in a situation like that, can you use it? Even assuming Ayanokouji is the
        best in his grade, it would take a lot of determination to jump in just with that.”

    </p>
    <p>Even if Ayanokouji’s class temporarily rises to A Class, the closer they are, the more likely they are to switch
        places in a single special test.

    </p>
    <p>If Sakayanagi fights back and resurfaces, the class transfer will lead to a massive failure.

    </p>
    <p>He may be saved if he is lucky enough to get a transfer ticket from Ayanokouji’s class again, but that’s just a
        series of what-ifs.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s a useless product unless you can clearly stall like Ichinose’s class.”

    </p>
    <p>This kind of discussion is not limited to just Hashimoto and Kamuro.

    </p>
    <p>It is one of those common subjects that is also discussed as chatter among other students day and night.

    </p>
    <p>“Tickets aren’t the only way to transfer classes. Right?”

    </p>
    <p>“If you’re talking about the 20,000,000 points, it’s far from possible. It’s very unrealistic.”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro continued with a tone of exasperation.

    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Hashimoto always considers moving by cooperation on a class basis, rather than by individual.

    </p>
    <p>“I know it’s none of my business, but are you aiming to profit while others fight?”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro did not put it into words, but Sakayanagi is always aware of Hashimoto’s suspicious activities.

    </p>
    <p>The person in question has also made several reports of this kind.

    </p>
    <p>Other than himself, Sakayanagi probably has a number of students, regardless of year, keeping an eye on
        Hashimoto.

    </p>
    <p>If he shows any signs of betraying the class and trying to run away, he will be targeted at that very moment.

    </p>
    <p>“It doesn’t matter who wins as long as I’m in A Class in the end. It’s as simple as that.”

    </p>
    <p>“I get what you’re trying to say. You shouldn’t get any strange ideas, though. For your own sake.”

    </p>
    <p>She gave him a warning and advice as a classmate.

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto quietly replied with a thank you, but he didn’t seem like he would accept the advice.

    </p>
    <p>It’s not as if he wants to betray them.

    </p>
    <p>It’s just that he doesn’t have to completely devote himself to Sakayanagi to graduate in A Class.

    </p>
    <p>The 1-strong system that existed when he first enrolled has faded away, and the top-three are already closing in
        behind him.

    </p>
    <p>No, he already had the alternatives of the top-three in the back of his mind in the first place.

    </p>
    <p>However, he miscalculated in assuming that the Ichinose Class would be the one to break out from the top-three.

    </p>
    <p>He did not really realize the influence of Ayanokouji in a real sense until after the middle of Year Two.

    </p>
    <p>In the several times he continued his scouting, he did not get a glimpse of him as a powerful man.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it was intentional.

    </p>
    <p>However, Ayanokouji’s quiet behaviour in the past few months gave way to more and more conspicuous activities.

    </p>
    <p>At first, he looked like someone who would not draw attention, and someone who was not interested in the class
        battles.

    </p>
    <p>What was the reason for the reversal?

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps he was intending to win from the very start?

    </p>
    <p>Is it that he simply decided this was the time to push up the class?

    </p>
    <p>Questions kept coming up and disappearing one after another.

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi, Ryuuen, and Ichinose all had a clear view of the whole picture.

    </p>
    <p>What kind of person was he, and what kind of action philosophy did he have?

    </p>
    <p>It’s not apparent from looking at Ayanokouji.

    </p>
    <p>A dangerous presence.

    </p>
    <p>“For now, I still want information. I’m going to look into Ayanokouji and the circumstances surrounding him.”

    </p>
    <p>“You can do whatever you want.”

    </p>
    <p>There is no order from Sakayanagi not to look into Ayanokouji.

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro thought that he could just do as he wanted.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, the recording from today is something that will be useful for the fighting ahead.

    </p>
    <p>However, she also noticed something else.

    </p>
    <p>Last year, Sakayanagi had instructed Kamuro alone to look into Ayanokouji.

    </p>
    <p>She wondered how well she was able to read into Ayanokouji’s abilities at that point in time.

    </p>
    <p>“Masumi-chan, a wise person listens to counsel.”

    </p>
    <p>Could Ayanokouji’s abilities be seen through at that point in time, though?

    </p>
    <p>One possibility came up in Kamuro’s mind at this point.

    </p>
    <p>Could it be that Sakayanagi actually knew of Ayanokouji’s real abilities?

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, Masumi-chan~?”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro quickly came to her senses and pushed away the hand that was being waved in front of her eyes.

    </p>
    <p>“...What?”

    </p>
    <p>“You weren’t paying attention. I’m gonna say some important stuff now.”

    </p>
    <p>Kamuro stopped thinking for now, and focused on listening to Hashimoto.

    </p>
    <p>“I have a bad feeling.”

    </p>
    <p>“Won’t you help me get in direct touch with Ayanokouji? Let’s do it together.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Why me?”

    </p>
    <p>“He’s definitely cautious of me. Ryuuen is gonna be troublesome if I handle things poorly.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s the same if I’m with you too. Ayanokouji’s still going to be cautious of me as well.”

    </p>
    <p>“The more of us there are, the more vigilant Ayanokouji will be, and if we have four eyes and ears, we’ll be able
        to pick up double the information. Am I wrong?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m willing to accept that offer, but I have a condition.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, what is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Never call me Masumi-chan again. This is an absolute condition.”

    </p>
    <p>“...F-Fine. It’s okay if I call you Kamuro-chan… right?”

    </p>
    <p>It looked like negotiations were concluded here, but Kamuro continued.

    </p>
    <p>“One more thing. I’m going to be the one who contacts Ayanokouji.”

    </p>
    <p>“Just you, Kamuro-chan?”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto had a suspicious expression after this suggestion.

    </p>
    <p>“If Sakayanagi finds out that I’m with you, it’s going to cause unneeded misunderstandings.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not gonna deny that.”

    </p>
    <p>She wanted to go at it alone, out of fear that Ayanokouji would be more cautious otherwise.

    </p>
    <p>It was not a great proposition for Hashimoto, however.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll find out what you want to know, so just accept that.”

    </p>
    <p>If Hashimoto tried to force Kamuro here, however, Kamuro will mercilessly pretend that this talk never happened.

    </p>
    <p>Moreover, for some reason, she didn’t want him to call her Masumi.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I have no choice. Okay, let’s join hands.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto decided to agree and held out his right hand. Kamuro did not return it, and only gave him a cold stare.

    </p>
    <p>“Cold as always. I really like you though, Kamuro-chan.”

    </p>
    <p>“How can you say that even though you have a girlfriend?”

    </p>
    <p>“No way.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto was saddened by the rejection and he clutched his forehead.

    </p>
    <p>He was smiling the whole time, so Kamuro shook her head after being made to go along with his jokes.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m leaving now.”

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry I took up your time. Ah, do let me know about the day and time, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto made sure to remind her of that point.

    </p>
    <p></p>
