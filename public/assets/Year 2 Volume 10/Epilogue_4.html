    <h3>Part 4</h3>
<p>
I’ve learned something new by entrusting Hashimoto with escorting us. 

</p><p>After all, no bizarre proposal can be realized if all the members aren’t satisfied with it. 

</p><p>Hashimoto proposed many things other than karaoke, but Kamuro refused it all. As a result, Kamuro agreed to chat in a cafe. 

</p><p>The group had nothing left to do, and this was the only plan they could come up with. 

</p><p>“Are we good now, Kamuro-chan? We have these two rare people with us, remember?” 

</p><p>“How about you go without me, then? Like I already said many times.” 

</p><p>Kamuro did say many times that we could go without her as she refused all of Hashimoto’s proposals. 

</p><p>“C’mon, we can’t leave you out, can we?” 

</p><p>“Umm, I actually like this. I like that you two are equals.” 

</p><p>“Wow. You’re a really good girl, Shiina-chan. Cute, too.” 

</p><p>It looks like he likes her, so Hashimoto took the initiative and sat down next to her. 

</p><p>On the other side, Kitou and I sat next to each other.

</p><p>“You’re pretty impressive, though, Ayanokouji. Most guys who have to sit next to Kitou get scared.” 

</p><p>“I already know he’s a good guy.”

</p><p>I guess it’s because of my experiences with him during the school trip, but I actually feel at ease with him. 

</p><p>“I agree with Ayanokouji-kun. Kitou-kun doesn’t look like a bad person.” 

</p><p>“Where the hell are you two looking?” 

</p><p>“Seriously. You two are of a rare kind.” 

</p><p>“Really?”

</p><p>Hiyori stared at Kitou to make sure.

</p><p>Kitou looked (glared) back at Hiyori, but Hiyori didn’t get scared.

</p><p>In fact, Kitou is the one who had to avert his gaze from Hiyori.

</p><p>“Yeah, he is a good guy after all.” 

</p><p>“You’re wrong about that. I’m not a good person.”

</p><p>Only the darkness moved as he stared (glared) at me. 

</p><p>He warned me with his eyes not to misunderstand anything. 

</p><p>“Now, let’s hear it, shall we, Ayanokouji?” 

</p><p>Hashimoto’s been facetious up until now, but he put his elbows on the table, took a cup like a microphone and leaned his arm towards the table.

</p><p>Kamuro, who had been looking in the opposite direction, straightened her posture.

</p><p>He contacted me because there was something he wanted to ask me.

</p><p>I already had that possibility in my head, but I wonder what he wants to know?

</p><p>“So, you’re planning to suddenly ditch Karuizawa and switch to Shiina? That’s why you’re on a date with Shiina, right?” 

</p><p>Hashimoto moved the cup towards me, like a reporter asking a celebrity a question. 

</p><p>It was Kamuro who stopped his extending arm. 

</p><p>“Hashimoto.”

</p><p>“Huh? What now, Kamuro-chan? I’m gonna make him spill everything, so just-”

</p><p>“You’re being too indirect, so I’m just going to step in myself.” 

</p><p>She warned him with a strong tone not to continue his troublesome chit-chat. 

</p><p>“You’re scaring me, Kamuro-chan. Well, that’s a part of your charm, but–!” 

</p><p>Hashimoto suddenly fainted in agony with an expression of pain.

</p><p>He rushed to grab his leg. It looks like she kicked his leg under the table.

</p><p>“That’s my weak-point, you’re way too merciless..!” “It just happened.”

</p><p>Kamuro replied while looking away without any concern. Hashimoto cut in after the peak of his pain. 

</p><p>“I, no, us A Class can’t help but be curious about you.”

</p><p>“Why?” 

</p><p>“I don’t have to say it, do I? You can study, and it looks like you can exercise too, and Ichinose really seems to like you too. You can talk with Ryuuen without being afraid of him. On top of all that, you also seem really close with Princess… You’re definitely not normal.” 

</p><p>A lot of people have been observing me and my relationships during the winter break. 

</p><p>I guess I can understand why Hashimoto would ask me these things after all their observations. 

</p><p>“The B Class has made rapid progress. You’re the true leader supporting Horikita from the shadows, aren’t you?” 

</p><p>Both Kamuro and Kitou stopped moving and looked over at me. 

</p><p>This wasn’t set up by chance, including Kamuro’s moves and remarks earlier. 

</p><p>Considering Kamuro's reaction, it appears that Hashimoto is taking the initiative in stirring things up, but it is safe to assume that this was calculated and planned in advance.

</p><p>As if attracted by the seeds I have sown, rumours flow from reconnaissance, speculation, and information. 

</p><p>Whether it is true or not, the rumours that circulate in this way reveal new aspects of the situation.

</p><p>I thought it was still a long way off, but I knew I would be asked this question. 

</p><p>So, let's water the seed from here. 

</p><p>“The true leader? What if I was?”

</p><p>“Whoa. I thought you’d be quick to deny it, but you admit it?” 

</p><p>“I’m not admitting it. I’m just wondering what would happen if that really was the case.” 

</p><p>“That comes after we have proof.” 

</p><p>“Proof? I guess it’s best that I admit I’m the true leader then, like you want me to.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto’s constant smile changed into a bitter one after my reply.

</p><p>“What a troubling answer.” 

</p><p>I can get upset that Hashimoto hit the mark, or I could proudly admit it. 

</p><p>I could also fully deny it. 

</p><p>No matter which one I choose, I’m sure he was confident that he could turn his doubts into convictions. 

</p><p>So, it’s going to be Hashimoto who gets in trouble if I take a stance that is neither of these choices. 

</p><p>No admission, and no denial. 

</p><p>If anything, it’s a position of being willing to admit it. 

</p><p>In truth, I am now leaving Horikita’s back. 

</p><p>I’m going to have the carpet pulled out from under me in my future battles if I decide on my own that I’m the true leader.

</p><p>“What do you think, Kamuro-chan?” 

</p><p>“A gray close to black.” 

</p><p>“Kitou?”

</p><p>Unlike Kamuro, who replied right away, Kitou waited while looking at me.

</p><p>“I’m gonna correct something. I think it may have been too much to say that you’re the true leader, but I definitely think you’re a leading actor in the shadows that has been guiding B Class.”

</p><p>“It’s up to you, and the A Class to decide that.” 

</p><p>“Shiina-chan, what do you think about Ayanokouji?” 

</p><p>“Me?” 

</p><p>“Yes. I definitely want to hear your opinion about this too.”

</p><p>“I’ve been wondering what you wanted to do after this talk, Hashimoto-kun.” 

</p><p>“Hm? What do you mean?” 

</p><p>“I mean what comes ahead in the future after your concern about Ayanokouji-kun.” 

</p><p>“...That’s a good point.”

</p><p>It looks like Hashimoto’s opinion of Shiina changed for the better with that one remark.

</p><p>“Hashimoto, what’s going on?” 

</p><p>Kamuro didn’t understand the meaning behind Shiina’s question. 

</p><p>“We talked about it a while ago, Kamuro-chan. About how to graduate in A Class. The best way is to collect 20,000,000 points as an individual, but that’s no easy task. Even if you want to rely on the new class transfer ticket system, you can only use it during a short period of time.” 

</p><p>“Yeah.” 

</p><p>“It’s important to have your eyes on a class that has a chance of winning and rising up, and try to entice them to pick you up. Is a class going to pay 20,000,000 and pick me up after just doing them a favour or two, though..?”

</p><p>“Of course not. As long as there’s no concrete contract, that is.”

</p><p>“That’s right. How do you think I can increase my chance of graduating in A Class, then? Work together with the class? Drop my rivals? No, that’s all wrong.” 

</p><p>“Luring away the strong out of the other classes, right?” 

</p><p>Hiyori came up with the answer and muttered before Hashimoto could reply. 

</p><p>“Wow. Good job, Shiina-chan.” 

</p><p>Kamuro and Kitou turned to look at Hashimoto with heavy eyes as he complimented Hiyori. 

</p><p>This unconscious move is because they noticed how smart the girl named Shiina Hiyori is.

</p><p>There are a lot of students with high Academic Ability in the OAA. 

</p><p>Yet, that doesn’t let you see whether they have any talent in fields outside of studying. 

</p><p>“Even if you can’t save up 20,000,000 by yourself, it’s possible to do it with the entire class’ consensus. Just like how Ryuuen-kun pulled out Katsuragi-kun, A Class can also pull in superior personnel from the other classes and become firmer in its position as it erases strength from its rival classes.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto generously applauded with praise and repeated the correct answer.

</p><p>“Show us, Ayanokouji. If you prove your strength to us A Class, we’ll pull you out using class points. You’ll be in a better position then, right?” 

</p><p>I can’t judge Hashimoto’s invitation as a complete lie. 

</p><p>However, I can come up with many reasons to judge it as real. 

</p><p>“Headhunting, huh? Do you think Sakayanagi’s gonna welcome Ayanokouji in, though?” 

</p><p>One of the reasons. Kamuro confirmed that Sakayanagi would not welcome me. 

</p><p>“I know that the princess has her own ideas, but I think there’s plenty of chance of this happening.”

</p><p>“On what basis?”

</p><p>“I can show you, but I wanna know what Ayanokouji thinks first.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto didn’t reply to Kamuro’s question and asked me for confirmation. 

</p><p>“If you’re going to take me into A Class, then that’s the best proposal I could hope for.” 

</p><p>“That’s right. Are you going to accept it if A Class invites you in? It’s okay even if we’re just talking hypothetically, so please let me hear it.” 

</p><p>“If you’re going to take me into A Class right now, then I’d like to consider it in a positive manner.” 

</p><p>Hashimoto pulled away in an amused manner when I showed my intention to accept his invitation. 

</p><p>“Okay. No problems with his confirmation. I guess we can move on to the next stage, then.” 

</p><p>It looks like the conversation is going to continue, as Hashimoto laughed with more joy than anyone else here. 

</p><p>However, someone else from the same class pulled her chair and stood up.

</p><p> “You’re talking like I’m not here, but I won’t participate in your recklessness.” 

</p><p>“H-Hey, Kamuro-chan, are you leaving?” 

</p><p>“You’re not going to listen to me anyway, right?” 

</p><p>“If you’re talking about our promise from earlier, I’m sorry about that.” 

</p><p>He frantically tried to stop her, but Kamuro left with quick steps. 

</p><p>“C’mon~... Did I go too far?”

</p><p>He checked with Kitou, who was silent, and nodded without a word.

</p><p>“I’ll get her back, so just wait.”

</p><p>Scratching his head, Hashimoto ran after Kamuro.

</p><p>“You’re all really interesting. This is so much fun.” 

</p><p>Hiyori, who has been watching us, narrowed her eyes and smiled. 

</p><p>“...Really?” 

</p><p>Surprised to see that she was having fun, Kitou unexpectedly budded in. 

</p><p>After Hashimoto brought back Kamuro in a bad mood, the subject didn’t come back to me, but instead switched to trifling chit-chat. 

</p><p>Hiyori did feel out of place in particular, but rather participated in the conversation as the center of the topic and we spent some time together without a dull moment.
