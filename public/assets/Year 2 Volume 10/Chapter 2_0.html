    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h2>The Special Test of Survival and Expulsion</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        My school life started anew after the winter vacation’s end.

    </p>
    <p>It was a little confusing to exchange greetings with my classmates after having not seen each other for about two
        weeks before the new year, but other than that, the days passed by without any changes.

    </p>
    <p>When will the next Special Test be held?

    </p>
    <p>All of my classmates had that in the corner of their minds, but Horikita was above them in that she already had a
        hint from a higher grade student.

    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei, who represented the school days starting again then appeared.

    </p>
    <p>She headed for the teacher’s desk with her usual stiff and serious expression on her face.

    </p>
    <p>Interestingly enough however, the students somehow felt it on their skin that something was different this time.

    </p>
    <p>I also reached the same conclusion as I observed the entire classroom from the back.

    </p>
    <p>Reaching over the half-way point of the week today, Thursday, she looks like she’s finally going to start the
        preliminary match.

    </p>
    <p>“Good morning. Today, I’d like to talk to you about the 3rd semester’s Special Test.”

    </p>
    <p>Just as our homeroom teacher is watching my classmates of the last two years, the students are also carefully
        observing her too.

    </p>
    <p>“It looks like most of you aren’t surprised. I suppose you can guess the timing by now.”

    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei, realizing that she had her work cut out for her, corrected her posture and looked at the
        students.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll start explaining right away, because this Special Test’s rules are a little complicated.”

    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei plugged in the monitor and opened up a program.

    </p>
    <p>“Firstly, this Special Test will be held among all of the Year 2 students.”

    </p>
    <p>Our first piece of information is that Year 1 and Year 3 students will not be involved.

    </p>
    <p>“The rules will be different from the Special Tests where you used to compete side by side for first place
        against a determined class. I’ll explain it in a simple way while using illustrations. Look at the monitor right
        away.”

    </p>
    <p>The data prepared by the school was quickly read and a file was opened.


    </p>
    <p class="italic">‘The Special Test of Survival and Expulsion.’</p>
    <p>
        The first words that showed up were the name of the next Special Test.

    </p>
    <p>The students started getting nervous despite the simple name.

    </p>
    <p>“Survival and Expulsion? That seems super serious…”

    </p>
    <p>A usual, frank muttering from Ike. I certainly understand why he feels that way, though.

    </p>
    <p>Looking at the word ‘Expulsion’, it’s easy to let your imagination get out of control.

    </p>
    <p>The students never used that word in a concrete way, but everybody nicknames it ‘drop-out’ instead.

    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei began explaining the Special Test without any sidetracking.

    </p>
    <p>“This Special Test is first of all based on a method where the school separates it into different genres. Each
        class will choose a genre, choose the difficulty, and give assignments to their opponent class in pre-determined
        turns.”

    </p>
    <p>A quadrilateral illustration was displayed as an example.
    </p>
    <p>1: Class-A > 2: Class-B > 3: Class-C 4: Class-D > 1: Class-A </p>
    <p>
        “This lineup of classes is only an example, but it works in a clockwise way where Class-A first gives Class-B
        the assignment they chose. They’re the attacking side, while Class-B is the defending side. Class-B will solve
        the attack, in other words, the assignment given to them by Class-A, and receive points if they solve it
        correctly. This attack and defence pattern will repeat in a circle until it gets to the battle between Class-D
        and ClassA, which completes one turn.”

    </p>
    <p>From what I can tell with this explanation so far, you don’t increase your points when you’re the attacker, and
        you increase your points when you’re on defence, depending on how many assignments you solve correctly.

    </p>
    <p>“After 10 turns total, the first half of the match is over. The rounds start again going counter-clockwise for
        the last half, with another 10 turns. The battle will be repeated for 20 turns in total.”

    </p>
    <p>There is even an illustration of the counter-clockwise version.


    </p>
    <p>1: Class-A > 2: Class-D > 3: Class-C > 4: Class-B > 1: Class-A </p>
    <p>
        I don’t know how the class positions are decided, but we shouldn’t ignore the fact that battles won’t occur
        against classes in diagonal directions.

    </p>
    <p>It would be too mentally taxing to go on the offensive against the class that poses the biggest threat.

    </p>
    <p>“Next, I’m going to give you the details on the manner of attack. The school will provide separate genres at the
        start. There will be genres based on academic ability such as Literature, Economy, English, Calculation, Kanji,
        History, and also genres separate from school work such as Sub-Culture and Entertainment.”

    </p>
    <p>“Does a student really need to know about entertainment.? I’m not into that stuff…”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou clearly showed his displeasement after hearing a word he wasn’t used to hearing.

    </p>
    <p>“Indeed, it is outside a student’s usual duties. However, people who don’t know about the society they live in
        will be eliminated when they go out into the real world. To give a reverse example, there will also be many
        cases where people who can’t study are still valued just because they can keep up a good conversation with
        others. In other words, this will test your general combined knowledge as a human.”

    </p>
    <p>This explanation convinced some, but others still don’t seem to understand. That’s the mood in the classroom.

    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei felt this, and added on:

    </p>
    <p>“Some of you don’t seem to get it, so I’ll put it in an even simpler way. In short, I can say that it will be
        similar to a quiz. The attacking class will provide the quiz questions, and the defending class will solve them.
        That’s pretty much it.”

    </p>
    <p>Most students showed that they came to an understanding after that simple expression.

    </p>
    <p>At the same time, more than a few had suspicious expressions.

    </p>
    <p>It’s no wonder, as one can easily let their imagination run wild after hearing the word ‘quiz’.

    </p>
    <p>However, the people who successfully complete quizzes certainly aren’t just the ones who are academically
        superior.

    </p>
    <p>No matter what their academic background is, most people still have something else of note to mention.

    </p>
    <p>In that sense, it is true that knowledge of entertainment and such aren’t completely unnecessary.

    </p>
    <p>If one chooses an entertainment-related career, there will be a huge difference between not knowing anything
        about the subject, and having abundant knowledge of it; both at the start and in the latter parts of their
        career.

    </p>
    <p>Knowledge outside of academia is also tested when trying to communicate with superiors and subordinates.

    </p>
    <p>It’s easy to reach the conclusion that if one shows off their ability there, then it will be a plus for them in
        most cases.


    </p>
    <p class="bold">The Attacker:

    </p>
    <p>No limit to the number of consecutive calls the students can make. Possible to consecutively choose the same
        genre.

    </p>
    <p>Choose 5 names from the opposing class on defence within 3 minutes after the start and declare them to the person
        in charge.

    </p>
    <p>*In cases where time runs out, the number of people that could not be chosen will be chosen at random.


    </p>
    <p class="bold">List of Genres:

    </p>
    <p>Literature, History, Maths, Society, Sports, Entertainment, Music, Economics, Miscellaneous Knowledge, English,
        Calculation, News, Kanji, Life, Gourmet, Sub-culture

    <p class="bold">
        Degree of Difficulty:
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>3 levels from 1 to 3 (The higher the number, the higher the difficulty.)


    </p>
    <p class="bold">Number of Targets:

    </p>
    <p>5 names.


    </p>
    <p>I can see why the school said there will be a wide range of topics.

    </p>
    <p>Just the genre choices alone are divided into 16 subjects.

    </p>
    <p>“The attacker class will first choose a genre from this list, and…”

    </p>
    <p>“Won’t everyone just give the most difficult assignments to their opponent?”

    </p>
    <p>He couldn’t help but mutter that out during Chabashira-sensei’s explanation.

    </p>
    <p>Ike frantically put his hand over his mouth after that, but it was already too late.

    </p>
    <p>Ike timidly looked up to Chabashira-sensei as the mood got awkward.

    </p>
    <p>He imagined that Chabashira-sensei would act very sternly when interrupted during her explanation, but now, she
        just sighed and didn’t seem like she would firmly scold him.

    </p>
    <p>“Be careful with rash remarks like that, Ike.”

    </p>
    <p>“Y-Yes, I’m sorry!”

    </p>
    <p>“The attacker side chooses the difficulty along with the genre, but the basic difficulty level on average is the
        average of the first level. They can choose level 2 or level 3 also, but they have to spend the points they’ve
        earned in order to do so. That is to say, the attacker can raise the difficulty by making a payment from their
        score.”

    </p>
    <p>She continued explaining the small details of the Special Test’s rules.

    </p>
    <p>It looks like the attacker side doesn’t just choose a genre.

    </p>
    <p>“The attacker will pick 5 names from their opponent and give them their assignment. They can consecutively choose
        the same students, or they can change them if they want. They can also consecutively choose the same genre as
        well.”

    </p>
    <p>There are no limits on the choice of students and genres, and the attacker is free to choose numerous
        undetermined students or to continue targeting the same students.

    </p>
    <p>“Then, if classes learn of the genres that other classes are bad at…”

    </p>
    <p>It’s reasonable to immediately reach that conclusion.

    </p>
    <p>The probability of answering all the questions incorrectly isn’t small if your opponent concentrates on your weak
        areas.

    </p>
    <p>“I understand you feel uneasy, but this isn’t a Special Test where you must conquer your weak areas beforehand.
        The individual’s knowledge is also important in this Special Test, but it’s also important for the class to
        understand its allies. It’s set up in a way where the leaders are not expected just to take the assignments as
        they come, but also to protect the students, assess the situation and sometimes take the offensive.”


    </p>
    <p class="bold">Defender:

    </p>
    <p>5 students can be protected for each assignment by the leader’s nomination.

    </p>
    <p>If a protected student is among the 5 names called by the attacker, that student is considered to have answered
        correctly.

    </p>
    <p>The defender must nominate 5 names before the attacker’s 3 minutes are up and declare them to the officer in
        charge.

    </p>
    <p>*If the defenders cannot nominate 5 students within the time limit, the remaining names will be decided at
        random.


    </p>
    <p class="bold">Exclusion of Assignments:

    </p>
    <p>The defenders may freely exclude up to 3 assignments from the 16 genres.
    </p>
    <p>The excluded genres may not be chosen by the attacker class.


    </p>
    <p class="bold">Elimination:

    </p>
    <p>If a student gets a total of 3 incorrect answers, they are eliminated from the competition and will not be
        eligible to be picked again.

    </p>
    <p>Further, a point will be deducted from the total for each student who drops out of the competition.

    </p>
    <p>*A minus point will be given even if the class is already at 0 points.


    </p>
    <p class="bold">Score:

    </p>
    <p>One point will be awarded for each correct answer (or successful protection).

    </p>
    <p>There is no reduction of points for incorrect answers.


    </p>
    <p>“I’m sure many people are confused at this point, but, since you can exclude 5 names while on defence, you can
        put precedence on the students if they are targeted on a turn basis. Of course, the attacker will also change
        their targets if they decide that they will be protected. You’re going to have to think about a lot more than
        just answering correctly.”



    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>1st place class points: 100</p>
    <p>
        2nd place class points: Minus 50</p>
    <p>
        3rd place class points: Minus 50</p>
    <p>
        4th place class points: Minus 100</p>
    <p>

        *If two or more classes have the same points, an additional match will be held to decide the winner.
    </p>
    <p>*If all four classes finish with the same points, all classes will get minus 100 points.

        <hr>
    </p>
    <p>“Whoa, what the hell!? Everyone but the first place loses class points!”

    </p>
    <p>It’s no wonder the students are shouting in surprise.

    </p>
    <p>Only one class out of the four classes can be a clear winner.

    </p>
    <p>Looking deeper into the rules, however, one can see why there is only one winner.

    </p>
    <p>If all four classes somehow colluded and came to a secret agreement, they could align their scores and finish the
        special test with equal scores. This is a counter-measure against that scenario.

    </p>
    <p>When the second place and below are in the negative, the classes won’t be able to compete by crossing over the
        class boundaries.

    </p>
    <p>Even if the classes join together, there is only one class that can win.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, one can make a contract to receive private points in exchange for class points, like the contract
        Ryuen made with Katsuragi in the Uninhabited Island Special test on our first summer, but unless you have a
        strategy to ensure first place, nobody will cooperate with you.

    </p>
    <p>The rules make it easy to get high scores if you join hands with other classes, so the restrictions imposed by
        the school to prevent this from happening are stronger than I thought.

    </p>
    <p>It is also a valuable opportunity to expel certain students if they finish in last place.

    </p>
    <p>Nobody would throw away this once in a lifetime opportunity that is a step beyond the Special Tests we had in the
        past, unless there was some kind of compensation.

    </p>
    <p>If any cooperation can be achieved, it will be through a mutual ‘no expulsions’ agreement.

    </p>
    <p>This would be the way to ensure equality and safety for all classes.

    </p>
    <p>However, leaving Horikita and Ichinose aside, it is very unlikely that Ryuen or Sakayanagi would accept this
        proposal.

    </p>
    <p>In addition, because of the structure where each class has to fight two other classes, it would not be easy to
        maintain a policy of no dropouts.

    </p>
    <p>“If there are multiple dropouts in the lowest ranked class, the class leader may nominate one of the dropouts.
        The nominated student has no right to veto, of course. If there are multiple classes tied for the lowest rank,
        it is possible that dropouts will emerge from multiple classes.”

    </p>
    <p>This means that if there is a dropout in the lowest ranked class, then there will definitely be more than one
        dropout.

    </p>
    <p>If an exception could be made, it would be by paying 20,000,000 points as always, or if a student with protection
        points is chosen.

    </p>
    <p>It is possible to avoid this in a case where the lowest ranked class has kept dropouts at 0, but it is almost
        impossible to do so in a straightforward manner.

    </p>
    <p>“Sensei, may I speak?”

    </p>
    <p>Horikita, sitting in front of Chabashira-sensei, raised her hand to ask for permission to speak.

    </p>
    <p>“I suppose. What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“What if a leader drops out during the Special Test? Are they required to leave the room or take some other
        special action?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll start by the latter question which is easier to answer; if someone drops out, they will not be named by the
        attacker, but other than that they will wait in the same spot like the other students. They’re also free to
        participate in dialogues.”

    </p>
    <p>In other words, they are put into the dropout list, but there are no other restrictions.

    </p>
    <p>“As for a leader dropping out, the leaders this time will not participate in the assignments in the first place.
        In other words, there is no risk of dropping out for a leader as the attacker cannot name them.”

    </p>
    <p>“So the leader will only command, and not participate in the fight…”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s right. The ones chosen as a leader do not face the risk of an expulsion. I’ll leave it up to the
        individual’s discretion whether this is a benefit or not.”

    </p>
    <p>The leader in charge of a class do not face the risk of expulsion.

    </p>
    <p>In exchange, they have to name a dropout from the students who have failed if their class ends up at the last
        rank.

    </p>
    <p>The responsibility for losing is great, yet the leader cannot take responsibility themselves and must instead
        expel a fellow student.

    </p>
    <p>It is a unique position in that the leader can have peace of mind, but few students would want to take on the
        responsibility of deciding who wins and loses, and who will be expelled in the event of a defeat.

    </p>
    <p>Leaving ruthless students such as Ryuen or Sakayanagi aside, most students would fear to take on such a
        responsibility.

    </p>
    <p>Having to push the button that opens the floorboard under the hanging man is a very difficult role.

    </p>
    <p>“Another important point is that you will be allowed to use your cellphones at all times, except when you are
        doing assignments on the defence side.”

    </p>
    <p>“Wait… Really?”

    </p>
    <p>“In fact, I would say that cellphones are an integral gadget for this Special Test. The details of the other
        class will be disclosed after the test starts. This means you will have to handle the information in real time
        to find the best solution for who will be excluded from which genre.”

    </p>
    <p>The 3 classes have a total of more than 100 students.

    </p>
    <p>The two classes we will face have around 80.

    </p>
    <p>It will not be possible to specify the genre without the whole class working together and gathering information.

    </p>
    <p>There are also other advantages to using cellphones.

    </p>
    <p>Students who are not normally used to interacting with others often find it difficult to speak up when they
        notice something.

    </p>
    <p>Like when one thinks a question is easy at first, then realizes later on that it was a question to make a note
        of.

    </p>
    <p>It would be easy to send a message to a specific friend and ask their opinion on the question.

    </p>
    <p>“Of course, they can also be used for defence. You’re free to drive knowledge into your heads for the assignment
        right up until the last moment, or to contact the opponent class’s students to negotiate. You can do whatever
        you want. You’ll be able to come up with some measures if you notice a trend in the assignments during the
        test.”

    </p>
    <p>She just added on a new condition I never thought of before.

    </p>
    <p>Just the use of cellphones will greatly expand the range of attacks and defences.

    </p>
    <p>This aspect will probably be tested also to see how quickly and efficiently information can be shared.

    </p>
    <p>“The Special Test will be held next Friday. Firstly, please take some time before Monday next week after school
        to discuss who the leader will be and inform me. In the unlikely event that you are unable to select a leader,
        as I am sure you can guess, a leader will be chosen at random.”

    </p>
    <p>With the explanation of the Special Test seemingly coming to an end, Chabashira-sensei let out a heavy sigh.

    </p>
    <p>“You already know that this will be a tough fight. All I can say is…”

    </p>
    <p>She looked at the students, then continued.

    </p>
    <p>“...Do your best to not end up in last place. That’s all.”

    </p>
    <p>This is a Special Test where there is a risk of losing classmates if you lose, so it is an absolute necessity to
        avoid being bottom rank.

    </p>
    <p>We knew the 3rd semester’s Special Test might be a cruel one, and that is exactly what’s happening.

    </p>
    <p>Even with high academic and physical ability, it is possible that a talented student could be expelled from
        school, depending on the strategies the opponent uses to exploit gaps in their knowledge.

    </p>
    <p>Still, I am impressed that they are not using a system of scoring points by attacking this time.

    </p>
    <p>Since it’s the judgement of the defender that gains them points, it’s more important to think about one’s own
        class.

    </p>
    <p>It’s a Special Test where the leader and their classmates need to discuss how to score points.

    </p>
    <p>How well one knows their own class and their opponents will determine who wins or loses.
