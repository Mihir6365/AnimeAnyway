  <h3>Part 3</h3>
  <p>
    Directly after Sakayanagi conveyed her 5 picks as the attacker against
    Horikita in her second attack, Hashimoto stood up and approached Sakayanagi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of the usual faint smile, he had a stern expression on his face.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s an act that really stands out, since everyone except Hashimoto are
    sitting in their seats.
  </p>
  <p>“Is something wrong, Hashimoto-kun?”</p>
  <p>
    “I thought I warned you last night. Does this mean you don’t find the
    information I gave you useful?”
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>Genre: Gourmet, difficulty 1.</p>
  <p>
    Attacker Targets: Koenji Rokusuke, Hasabe Haruka, Hirata Yosuke, Yukimura
    Teruhiko, Onodera Kayano.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    He pointed at the names on the monitor behind him and showed his
    dissatisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>“Is that what it looks like to you?”</p>
  <p>“Yeah, it is.”</p>
  <p>
    “Well, your phone call yesterday was a little meddlesome. However,
    information is information. Of course I will not pointlessly ignore it after
    inscribing it in my hippocampus.”
  </p>
  <p>“Then… Why are you targeting Koenji?”</p>
  <p>“You told me the one target we must avoid in Class-B is Koenji, right?”</p>
  <p>
    “He has a contract with Horikita. So he’s always going to be protected and
    earn an unconditional point each time. I thought you would put my
    information to use here.”
  </p>
  <p>
    He wanted to be useful, but could not take it when that was quickly taken
    away from him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kitou, sensing a difference in Hashimoto’s attitude compared to his usual
    cheerful demeanour, pulled a chair.
  </p>
  <p>
    “You don’t need to worry about anything, Kitou-kun. Hashimoto-kun is just
    very dry.”
  </p>
  <p>
    After quietly laughing, Sakayanagi explained why she targeted Koenji despite
    the high possibility of him being protected.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’m sure it’s true that there is a contract between him and Horikita-san.
    However, it’s only based on not expelling him, and the second point is that
    he is free to do as he likes, yes?”
  </p>
  <p>“Yeah…”</p>
  <p>
    “It’s a waste of a valuable protection to continue to protect him. It would
    be best to keep watching until he is targeted once and gets the problem
    wrong. That’s the least one can do in order to win, don’t you think?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Horikita has a law-abiding personality, though. The class will be shaken if
    they see that she isn’t protecting him.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “If that’s enough to shake them, then they should be shaken anyway. Keeping
    the contract intact is important too, but I would rather doubt her character
    as a leader if she continued wasting a protection on Koenji-kun.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The Horikita class decided their protections during the explanation, so the
    monitor’s screen changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were no successful protections, and the 5 names Sakayanagi picked
    would all take on the assignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    “How about that? As expected, she did not use a protection on Koenji-kun.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto can’t keep hounding Sakayanagi about this after seeing the
    results.
  </p>
  <p>
    “...Yeah, you’re right. What’s the point in going so far to take a point
    from Koenji, though? He’s weirdly smart, so there’s a higher chance for him
    to answer correctly than the other small fish, isn’t there?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I suppose so. He is a completely free person. As such, as long as he is
    promised this freedom by Horikita-san, he has no obligation to take the
    questions seriously. He might even get them wrong on purpose.”
  </p>
  <p>Sakayanagi spoke with conviction as if she could see the future.</p>
  <p>No way, Hashimoto thought, and he waited for the screen to change.</p>
  <p>
    As a result, Koenji got the question wrong as expected. One step closer to
    elimination.
  </p>
  <p>“It was a little risky, but we took 1 point. Impressive, Hime-san.”</p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto was put at ease for the moment, but that quickly went even in the
    next turn. Because immediately after their next turn as the attacker began,
    Sakayanagi named Koenji right away.
  </p>
  <p>
    She also picked the same genre, seemingly trying to show that she is
    targeting him on purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that, the students who heard the conversation also started making a
    commotion instead of just Hashimoto.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Hey, what are you doing? Aren’t they going to protect Koenji if you pick
    the same genre too?”
  </p>
  <p>Kamuro spoke up, confused by what Sakayanagi was doing.</p>
  <p>
    “You’re not going to tell me he won’t be protected this time either,
    right..?”
  </p>
  <p>“That’s how I see it. It’s the reason I named Koenji-kun again.”</p>
  <p>
    Despite feeling that this was a foolish conjecture, the students stayed in
    their seats and waited as they looked at the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Defender Successful Protections: None “Seriously..? What the hell is
    Horikita thinking?”
  </p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto grumbled in the face of the reality that Koenji was not protected
    this time either.
  </p>
  <p>Then, the unthinkable act of Koenji answering incorrectly again.</p>
  <p>
    “I’m not on Hashimoto’s side here, but why did you think they wouldn’t
    protect him this time either?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Because of the same logic as the first time. He can answer incorrectly two
    times, so there is no need to protect him anyway. If she has to protect him,
    then she wants to wait until the final moment she has to do so. I’m sure
    Horikita-san did want him to answer correctly, though.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “...I see. So now, Horikita has to protect Koenji even if she doesn’t want
    to.”
  </p>
  <p>Kitou muttered after being convinced by Sakayanagi’s words.</p>
  <p>
    Horikita would not waste a protection on Koenji, as long as he still had the
    leeway for failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, Sakayanagi took a risk and continued targeting Koenji in
    order to waste her opponent’s protection in the later turns.
  </p>
  <p>That’s the analysis.</p>
  <p>
    The fact that the two gourmet questions in a row were simple just couldn’t
    be helped.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is still the stage where each class is trying to determine how
    difficult every genre is.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’m sorry I doubted you, Princess. You had a plan, after all. But in that
    case, why not target Koenji from turn 1? That would destroy their protection
    slot for the remaining 8 turns. We lost 1 turn.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I was 99% sure she would not protect Koenji-kun, but the reason I waited
    until turn 2 is that I wanted to be completely sure. It was also an
    important move to lure them into making a mistake on turn 2. What if I
    attacked on turn 1 and Horikita-san decided to protect him after that? That
    would make things a lot more difficult for us.”
  </p>
  <p>There is a risk of being led around by a deceptive protection slot.</p>
  <p>
    She thought that Horikita would feel like there is some leeway if she
    continuously succeeded in protecting him, and that Horikita would gain
    control of the pace.
  </p>
  <p>
    “So, thanks to him answering incorrectly on the first easy question, I was
    able to calculate that he would answer incorrectly the second time as well,
    and the results are great. It’s all thanks to the information you gave me.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto felt relieved after it was confirmed he was useful, and he
    returned to his seat after nodding.
  </p>
  <p>“Now, let’s finish things up with Koenji-kun.”</p>
  <p>
    On turn 4, Sakayanagi surprised everyone by naming Koenji as her first
    target.
  </p>
  <p>
    “We can’t be too careful. I’m threatening that we can target him again any
    time if they show a gap in their defense. Thanks to your information,
    Hashimoto-kun, we know the inner circumstances of the Horikita class.
    However, she doesn’t believe that her contract with Koenji-kun has been
    leaked.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I see… This will make her feel that she has to use a protection slot of
    Koenji no matter what now.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Sakayanagi chose Gourmet again, but she also raised the difficulty up to 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto felt that it would be a loss if Koenji is protected, but he did
    not point it out.
  </p>
  <p>However, things developed in a mostly unexpected direction from there.</p>
  <p>Defender Successful Protections: Shinohara Satsuki, Sudou Ken.</p>
  <p>Horikita made the unthinkable choice of not protecting Koenji.</p>
  <p>“Why isn’t she protecting him?”</p>
  <p>“Maybe the information you gave me was fake?”</p>
  <p>“No way..! Horikita definitely made a promise to protect Koenji!”</p>
  <p>
    In the end, Koenji answered correctly and escaped elimination, but it was
    still very confusing.
  </p>
  <p>
    On one hand, Sakayanagi did not consume a protection slot, and Koenji
    answered correctly to avoid an elimination this time, which let her have a
    full grasp of the situation.
  </p>
  <p>“Does this mean Horikita abandoned Koenji..?”</p>
  <p>“This is our chance, then. We’ll crush him right now.”</p>
  <p>
    Kitou’s remark showed that he did not see this as a bad thing, but instead
    as a reason to keep targeting Koenji.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Yeah, that might be the way to go. It’ll lower their trust in Horikita and
    demoralize them.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto saw the fact that Horikita chose not to use a protection slot as
    proof that the opponent class was in disarray.
  </p>
  <p>On the other hand, Sakayanagi reached a different conclusion.</p>
  <p>
    “I thought she would unconditionally protect him, or that he would be
    eliminated, but… It looks like Horikita-san has a different aim in her mind.
    We’re just going to make her happy if we keep targeting Koenji-kun now.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Sakayanagi chuckled and opened her cellphone “Still, I’m impressed that
    she’s thinking about ways to fight against me.”
  </p>
  <p>Sakayanagi started thinking.</p>
  <p>Perhaps Ayanokoji was hiding behind Horikita.</p>
  <p>
    Was everything that happened so far a strategy built up under the guidance
    of someone?
  </p>
  <p>“For now, I’m pretty sure he’s not involved in this.”</p>
  <p>
    If Ayanokoji was pulling the strings from behind the scene, such information
    would have made it to the other classes.
  </p>
  <p>Sakayanagi felt a strange, unusual and imperceptible presence.</p>
  <p>There was a hint of Ayanokoji’s thinking in Horikita’s actions.</p>
  <p>
    “She’s watching his back from more close up than anyone else, so I’d expect
    her to have grown this much, at least.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Sakayanagi can see where this is going. She won’t be overtaken by Horikita
    in this battle.
  </p>
  <p>“The problem is…”</p>
  <p>
    For Sakayanagi, who is in charge of Class-A, there is not one specific class
    to be wary of.
  </p>
  <p>
    The real problem is the possibility of 2, or even 3 classes joining hands in
    secret against her.
  </p>
  <p>That is the only concerning matter for Sakayanagi.</p>
  <p>
    She continued her spying and observations after the Special Test was
    announced, and did not detect any signs of such activities, nor did she
    receive any reports about them.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it’s very possible that the classes have joined hands in secret.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s precisely why the only way for her to determine whether there is
    cooperation or not is during the test, and she decided that the possibility
    of an alliance between the other classes is currently almost zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is nothing unnatural about the other classes’ offense and defense.
  </p>
  <p>“Let us go for 1st place.”</p>
  <p>
    Sakayanagi had earned 29 points in total when the first half came to an end.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a joyous thing to be in 1st place, but the shadow of Class-B chasing
    after her with a 1 point difference directly after still lingers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto, without standing up, looked at the results shown on the monitor,
    and the remaining break time.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Masumi-san, shall we go for lunch? You were eliminated, so it won’t be an
    issue, right?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Fine by me, but you’re really inconsiderate when talking to people, you
    know.”
  </p>
  <p>
    It wasn’t a compliment, but Sakayanagi happily smiled and started walking
    while using her cane.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kitou quietly looked at the two and followed after them when they entered
    the corridor.
  </p>
  <p>“When did you invite him?”</p>
  <p>“I invited him over the phone.”</p>
  <p>“Hmm. So, are you sure you shouldn’t invite Hashimoto?”</p>
  <p>
    Hashimoto is often together with them when Kamuro and Kitou are seated at
    the same table.
  </p>
  <p>It seems this caught Masumi’s attention.</p>
  <p>
    “I did invite him, but he refused. He also answered 2 problems incorrectly
    after being targeted by Ryuen-kun. It’s only natural he doesn’t want to be
    eliminated.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Kamuro imagined Hashimoto frantically looking things up on his phone, and a
    very faint smile appeared on her face.
  </p>
  <p></p>
