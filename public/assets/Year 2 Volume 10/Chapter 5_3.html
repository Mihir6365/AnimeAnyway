    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        I watched Hiyori’s back as she returned to the library, and headed for the entrance to leave the school.
    </p>
    <p>It was just around lunch time, so I could see a few students from clubs around. I found two classmates who were
        talking to each other just as I arrived at the entrance.

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, Ayanokoji? Why are you in school?”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou noticed me first.

    </p>
    <p>He was in his basketball uniform.

    </p>
    <p>Yousuke, on the other hand, was wearing his soccer uniform.

    </p>
    <p>“Happy New Year. I just ran into Sudou-kun. We were talking about eating lunch together.”

    </p>
    <p>“Still, this is a pretty rare pairing.”

    </p>
    <p>“Is it? It’s been happening a lot lately.”

    </p>
    <p>“Right.”

    </p>
    <p>I don’t think their relationship was that close, but it seems they became close enough to have lunch together.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps Sudou’s growth put him on the same wave-length as Yousujke.

    </p>
    <p>“What about Onodera-san, though?”

    </p>
    <p>“It looks like she caught a cold yesterday, so she’s not going to club activities today either.”

    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, it looks like it’s not usually just the two of them, but Onodera also.

    </p>
    <p>This is the kind of relationship that can only be built by students involved in club activities.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokoji-kun, are you coming back from the library?”

    </p>
    <p>Yousuke asked me, perhaps noticing the books in my hands.

    </p>
    <p>I said yes, then started naturally walking towards the convenience as Sudou led us there.

    </p>
    <p>“The cafeteria isn’t open during the winter break, huh?.”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm. Normally, I bring food from home or buy some from the convenience store.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like they eat inside the school after purchasing their food.

    </p>
    <p>They seem to eat on the benches outside school during spring or fall, but there’s no choice in this season.

    </p>
    <p>According to what I’ve heard however, there are several places open like a cafeteria with heating, so that the
        students coming in for club activities can eat.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s been snowing on and off, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s really depressing. It’s gonna be insatiable like this for two more weeks, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“I can’t move my body in this cold either, so I really want it to get warmer already.”

    </p>
    <p>I can’t participate in this conversation, as I’m a part of the go-home club.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t feel alienated, but rather feel calm just listening to these two people, who I thought didn’t fit in with
        each other, talking so naturally.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way Ayanokoji-kun, is that thing with Karuizawa-san alright now? It looks like you’ve been working really
        hard.”

    </p>
    <p>“Ah, so you heard about it too after all.”

    </p>
    <p>“You two looked strange from before the winter vacation. It’s easy to tell even just by looking at you in the
        classroom.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m sure it’s alright. Wait, did they finally break up or something?”

    </p>
    <p>Yousuke bitterly smiled at Sudou who suddenly cut in, but it’s far from the reality so he quickly denied.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think so. I guess they just had a little trouble?”

    </p>
    <p>As expected, Sudou also doesn’t seem to know what happened after Christmas.

    </p>
    <p>“The problem is already solved. It’s going to be back to normal starting this year.”

    </p>
    <p>“Ah, I see. That’s great.”

    </p>
    <p>“What, you didn’t break up?”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou disappointedly put his hands on the back of his head.

    </p>
    <p>“Did you want us to break up?

    </p>
    <p>“N-No, of course not. It was just a little joke.”

    </p>
    <p>He denied his remarks of celebrating someone else’s misfortune and apologized.

    </p>
    <p>It looks like spring isn’t here for Sudou yet, but I’m sure there are signs of it happening.

    </p>
    <p>“Aren’t there any developments with Onodera?”

    </p>
    <p>“H-Hey, don’t talk about that. I don’t want Hirata to misunderstand things.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou got frantic the moment her name was put out, but Yousuke simply looked on with warm eyes.

    </p>
    <p>“I think Yousuke knows already.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Seriously?”

    </p>
    <p>Does he think that no one noticed their delicate relationship?

    </p>
    <p>“I know that Onodera-san has been paying attention to you for a little while now.”

    </p>
    <p>He’s very sensitive to the eyes and actions of his classmates. I’m not going to say anything unnecessary, but I’m
        not surprised that he knows.

    </p>
    <p>“So, what about it?”

    </p>
    <p>“We’re just normal friends with Onodera…”

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps he doesn’t feel any direct love for Onodera yet, or he hasn’t realized it, and he denied it with a frown.

    </p>
    <p>I thought that he still had some lingering attachment to Horikita, but I don’t feel like this is the case.

    </p>
    <p>From his attitude, it just looks like he’s not the kind of man who would take advantage of Onodera’s feelings.

    </p>
    <p>The three of us returned to the school while feeling the cold on our skins after stopping by at the convenience
        store.

    </p>
    <p>We found that it was quite crowded when we went to the cafeteria, and there were many students including both
        seniors and juniors who belonged to club activities.

    </p>
    <p>Since students like me can visit the cafeteria even if we’re not involved in any club activities, there are
        probably some students here just to have lunch with friends.

    </p>
    <p>Some juniors came over to say hello to Sudou and Yousuke.

    </p>
    <p>“You two really look like proper seniors.”

    </p>
    <p>“Our second year is almost over, so. We’re Year Threes when it finally ends after the third term. It still feels
        a bit strange, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou bit into his onigiri.

    </p>
    <p>A salmon was peeking out from between the seaweed and the rice.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way, something strange happened the other day. A girl from the same year asked me a lot of weird
        questions.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou muttered, perhaps remembering something after seeing a girl greet him.

    </p>
    <p>“Weird questions?”

    </p>
    <p>“Like when I started studying, and if I was studying or not up until now. I guess she wanted to know why my
        Academic Ability on my OAA has gone up.”

    </p>
    <p>There are some who are surprised about that even in our class. For someone from another class, it might even look
        like a little bit of magic.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m sure you didn’t feel bad about a girl asking you questions, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, it’s not like that. She looked cute, but she was still a bit belligerent, or high and mighty. It was right
        before my club activities too, so I just wanted her to let me go right away.”

    </p>
    <p>It doesn’t look like he’s looking for new excitement.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way, who was that?”

    </p>
    <p>“Hmm, what was it..? It’s not like I memorized the names of all the girls.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou put a third onigiri into his mouth and replied while chewing.

    </p>
    <p>“Should we check who it was, just for caution sake? You might run into her again.”

    </p>
    <p>Yousuke took out his phone, so he’s probably going to check the OAA.

    </p>
    <p>Sudou however stopped him with a wave of his hand.

    </p>
    <p>“It doesn’t matter. It would be different if the girl had a crush on me, but that’s definitely not the case.”

    </p>
    <p>It was a frustrating moment for Sudou, so I suppose he doesn’t want to know her name.

    </p>
    <p>“It looks like you’re getting attention for things other than your motor nerves now, Sudou.”

    </p>
    <p>“I won’t blame her if she was startled.”

    </p>
    <p>Instead of boasting, Sudou clasped his fist and got excited.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m just getting started.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like he’s not satisfied yet, and wants to surprise those around him even further.
