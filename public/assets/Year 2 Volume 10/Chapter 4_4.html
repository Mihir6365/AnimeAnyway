    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        Now, I’ve entered Keyaki Mall but I don’t know where Yamamura is.

    </p>
    <p>She could have already returned to her dorm from a different exit, but… What would I do if I was in Yamamura’s
        position?

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure she’s thinking about whether she should report her failure to Sakayanagi or not. When a person is in a
        psychologically uneasy state, they look for a safe place to go to.

    </p>
    <p>Aside from the option of returning to her dorm right away and assuming that she will remain in Keyaki Mall, where
        would she be?

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura dislikes crowds and doesn’t like to be in contact with others.

    </p>
    <p>Areas with high-traffic and in-store areas can be ruled out immediately.

    </p>
    <p>She can be alone in karaoke rooms, but there are unavoidable hurdles to doing it solo.

    </p>
    <p>A private restroom could be a relatively likely candidate, but I don’t think she would cause inconvenience to
        other people who’d want to use it.

    </p>
    <p>Then, there’s… She was between an outdoor vending machine and an interior plant just now.

    </p>
    <p>There are a couple of vending machines set up in the back near the rest area. She wouldn’t draw attention there,
        as it’s not a popular spot.

    </p>
    <p>I suppose it’s a good time of the day, because there wasn’t anyone to be seen near the resting area.

    </p>
    <p>There’s also no other people around the vending machines further in the back.

    </p>
    <p>I approached closer and quietly peeked around the side of a machine, which was a blind spot.

    </p>
    <p>“Eek!?”

    </p>
    <p>I saw Yamamura sitting next to the vending machine with a mini plastic tea bottle in her hands.

    </p>
    <p>She dropped her tea in surprise, but fortunately it had a lid.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I actually found you.”

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t have any proof she’d really be here, but…

        I picked up the bottle on the ground and handed it to Yamamura.

    </p>
    <p>“H-H-How did you tell I would be here..?”

    </p>
    <p>She frantically looked through her pockets.

    </p>
    <p>“No, I didn’t put a GPS on you or anything, okay?”

    </p>
    <p>“B-But, then how did you… Did you look for my phone’s location..?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, I didn’t.”

    </p>
    <p>It was a crazy fantasy, but I suppose she was surprised enough to think this way. Yamamura got up and peeked
        around the vending machine a little.

    </p>
    <p>“Ryuen and Katsuragi aren’t here.”

    </p>
    <p>“R-Really… E-Err, do you still want something from me?”

    </p>
    <p>“I couldn’t apologize earlier, right? I’m sorry, Yamamura. You wouldn’t have been found if I didn’t call out to
        you.”

    </p>
    <p>Then, she wouldn’t have to hide and worry between the vending machines like this either.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s my mistake to let you find me… Please don’t worry about it.”

    </p>
    <p>She replied without outwardly reproaching me. “Did you tell Sakayanagi that you were found?”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, well… I did. I think my turn on the stage is over now.”

    </p>
    <p>I got a surprising, frank reply. It looked like she was worried after what Ryuen told her, but… In any case, if
        she told Sakayanagi, then there’s no need to talk further about that point.

    </p>
    <p>There’s still something that I have to do with Yamamura myself.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m gonna compensate you for this somewhere.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Huh?”

    </p>
    <p>Since they were in the same group during the school trip, it would not be surprising if Yamamura and Kitou were
        to watch and follow Ryuen.

    </p>
    <p>There’s a high chance that Sakayanagi simply ordered them to keep an eye on him.

    </p>
    <p>Even if they were not, as long as they were in the same group, it’s only natural that they would be keeping an
        eye on Ryuen even if they were not instructed to do so by Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura was always concerned about the moves Ichinose’s class was making.

    </p>
    <p>However, this case is completely different. Katsuragi’s surprise.

    </p>
    <p>The fact that Sakayanagi might be using Yamamura as a valuable spy.

    </p>
    <p>The analysis of Ryuen’s fighting capability against Sakayanagi’s class has been taken one step further.

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen’s response to Yamamura will definitely be raised to a higher level in the future.

    </p>
    <p>It’s highly likely that Ryuen and Katuragi wouldn’t have been able to capture Yamamura if I had not noticed her
        presence and carelessly called out to her, and it’s needless to repeat who is to blame.

    </p>
    <p>“You don’t need to make it up to me or anything like that. You’re in a different class, so this doesn’t have any
        relation with you.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s as Yamamura says, but I also have a picture in mind.

    </p>
    <p>The reason for this is not something I would explain to anyone at this stage, so I’m going to come up with
        another reason.

    </p>
    <p>“I really just feel bad, because I ended up putting you at a disadvantage, no matter which way you look at it.”

    </p>
    <p>“But… Wouldn’t you say that the person following someone in the first place is at fault?”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like Yamamura was feeling guilty about this point.

    </p>
    <p>That may be why she didn’t show any discontent towards me.

    </p>
    <p>“Please, just don’t worry about it.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like it’s going to be difficult to get a good reaction from Yamamura here.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, she’s going to be more troubled if I stay here for too long.

    </p>
    <p>“Okay. I’ll help you out if you’re ever in any trouble, then. I’m not sure if I’d be useful, but just let me
        know.”

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure Yamamura can accept that, at least.

    </p>
    <p>Because whether she is in trouble or not, it’s going to be up to Yamamura to contact me.

    </p>
    <p>“Okay then, that’s fine.”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura nodded and accepted my proposal.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll be taking my leave now, then.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Thank you.”

    </p>
    <p>I suppose she wants to stay here for a while, and didn’t move away from the vending machine.

    </p>
    <p>I told Yamamura that I would be leaving and was about to do so, but…

        I turned around to see Kei and Satou walking over to us.

    </p>
    <p>I instinctively hid behind the vending machine with Yamamura behind me.

    </p>
    <p>“A-Ayanokoji-kun..!?”

    </p>
    <p>I feel bad for confusing Yamamura, but I signaled for her to be quiet.

    </p>
    <p>She understood my intent and got quiet.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, where should we go next!?”

    </p>
    <p>“Hmm~”

    </p>
    <p>I can hear the two having fun and chatting, and they’re getting closer.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t think they’ll notice me if I take a quick glance, but that’s only if they’re not going to use the vending
        machine.

    </p>
    <p>I may be hiding behind it, but I’ll be completely visible if they come up to it.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, wanna take a small rest? Want a drink?”

    </p>
    <p>Satou came up with a proposal that signaled the worst possible development.

    </p>
    <p>“Hmm…”

    </p>
    <p>Kei sounds hesitant.

    </p>
    <p>If they find me, then the fact that I was hiding is going to backfire in a really bad way.

    </p>
    <p>I’m huddled between vending machines in a tight space with someone of the opposite gender.

    </p>
    <p>It’s difficult to make up an excuse and say that nothing is going on here.

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, just for a while.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s for the best, since you just recovered.”

    </p>
    <p>I prepared myself for the worst, but it looks like they don’t want to use the vending machine.

    </p>
    <p>It looks like they’re just going to use the bench to rest a little.

    </p>
    <p>However, this doesn’t solve the problem.

    </p>
    <p>There’s only one exit, so I can’t leave without walking by the bench Kei and Satou are sitting on.

    </p>
    <p>“Thanks. Sorry I made you worry.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, it’s not a big deal. I mean, it’s only normal for us to help each other when we catch a cold…”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm, I’m going to nurse you back to health if you ever come down with anything, Maya-chan.”

    </p>
    <p>“Thanks. I’m really happy to hear that.”

    </p>
    <p>“I feel like you’re always supporting me, Maya-chan.”

    </p>
    <p>“R-Really?”

    </p>
    <p>“Do you remember when you came to talk to me about Kiyotaka back when we weren’t this close? It was right at the
        start of Year Two.”

    </p>
    <p>“I think I told you to frankly say how long you’ve had a crush on Ayanokoji-kun for.”

    </p>
    <p>Satou was embarrassed after she remembered this and slapped her red face.

    </p>
    <p>“Right, right. You really get into the core of things, and don’t run away from anything…”

    </p>
    <p>They’re talking at a normal volume, but I can hear everything well on this quiet side.

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura silently looked up to me.

    </p>
    <p>I held up one hand in apology for the conversation she probably didn’t want to hear.

    </p>
    <p>There’s no need to force herself to listen if she doesn’t want to.

    </p>
    <p>She’d probably not going to hear anything if she covers her ears with her hands.

    </p>
    <p>However, Yamamura surprisingly seems to be having a little fun.

    </p>
    <p>She didn’t seem to mind, and we quietly continued listening to the two’s conversation.

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura probably gathers information for Sakayanagi on most days.

    </p>
    <p>So, she must be used to listening to others.

    </p>
    <p>Anyone may find enjoyment in playing detective once or twice in a covert operation, but a lot of them will soon
        feel guilty about eavesdropping on people who don’t want to be listened to.

    </p>
    <p>I thought that Yamamura would also be fed up with her role as a spy, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.

    </p>
    <p>Combined with her faint presence and her natural skill, she’s actually very accustomed to this.

    </p>
    <p>The two chatted for a while, then their rest was over.

    </p>
    <p>“Should we go?”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you okay now?”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm. It’s been a long time since I went out, I wanna have as much fun as I can.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. Make sure you make up with Ayanokoji-kun though, okay?”

    </p>
    <p>“M-Mhm. I’ll do my best..!”

    </p>
    <p>These were the last words I heard as their voices got fainter and fainter.

    </p>
    <p>There’s a risk of them unexpectedly coming back, so I was about to signal for Yamamura to stay here for a while,
        but Yamamura quietly stopped me from jumping out with her hand before I could say anything. I suppose this much
        is to be expected.

    </p>
    <p>Then, Yamamura and I moved at the same time.

    </p>
    <p>“I think they’re gone.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah.”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura moved away from the vending machine first and checked the surroundings, and signaled me to come forward
        after confirming that there weren't any problems.

    </p>
    <p>“You’re pretty skilled at this.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Really? I’m always doing this, so.”

    </p>
    <p>After quietly clearing her throat, Yamamura continued with something unexpected.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you really going to make up with Karuizawa-san?”
    </p>
    <p>“Why are you talking like Satou?”
    </p>
    <p>“I’m just curious. She’s your girlfriend, right? I didn’t know you had a fight, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“It looks like there’s some things even information gathering specialists don’t know about.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you making fun of me?”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you?”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura was a little surprised at that reply, but she then faintly smiled.

    </p>
    <p>“This is a bit weird. You’re a strange person, Ayanokoji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>“I hear that a lot.”

    </p>
    <p>“Is that true, or is it a joke too?”

    </p>
    <p>“Who knows?”

    </p>
    <p>She’s still reserved, but Yamamura’s calm tone is easy to understand and not unpleasant.

    </p>
    <p>It’s probably because she’s always speaking in a calm tone like me.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way, what about my question from earlier?”

    </p>
    <p>“You didn’t forget?”
    </p>
    <p> “I remember it very well.”

    </p>
    <p>Surprisingly, Yamamura is also being a little aggressive, or a wall between us was broken, and she asked me so.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m going to make up with her. I have plans for it.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s good to hear.”

    </p>
    <p>This has nothing to do with her, and she has no common points with Karuizawa, but she still seemed happy to hear
        that.

    </p>
    <p>“You don’t need to report this to Sakayanagi.”

    </p>
    <p>“I can’t promise that I won’t.”

    </p>
    <p>“You’re pretty stern.”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura took a breath, then pulled out her phone and looked at the pitch-black screen.

    </p>
    <p>Then, she looked at me after hesitating a little.

    </p>
    <p>“About what happened with Ryuen-kun earlier… I haven’t actually reported it yet.”

    </p>
    <p>“You mean about them finding you?”

    </p>
    <p>“I know that I have to inform her, but… I think I’m afraid of being cut off. I have no other merits, so this is
        the one thing I can do. If she knows that I can’t even do that… I will be useless for the class.”

    </p>
    <p>I suppose it’s not about her academic ability or physical ability. Yamamura has a low sense of self-determination
        and is blind to the world around her.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t mind if you make it out to be my fault, but I guess that’s not the point.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi will judge that the fact this got out is the important part, regardless of if it’s Yamamura’s fault or
        mine.

    </p>
    <p>It doesn’t change the fact that Yamamura will be weaker as a spy from now on.

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe I can keep quiet about it..?”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you going to trust Ryuen’s words?”

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no other way for me to keep living right now…”

    </p>
    <p>“I understand how you feel, but you should be honest and inform her.”

    </p>
    <p>“But I can just wait until it gets revealed. Perhaps he’ll actually keep quiet about it. Maybe Ryuen-kun will get
        expelled by Sakayanagi-san.”

    </p>
    <p>She wants to put off the exposure of her failure.

    </p>
    <p>She’s not delusionally thinking about options to save her life with no basis.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s the worst possible choice. Ryuen is just exploiting a gap in your mind, and he’ll definitely expose you
        if necessary. Even if Sakayanagi can expel him from the school, there’s the danger of him leaving a souvenir
        behind.”

    </p>
    <p>For Ryuen, the fact that Yamamura has been found out is not that much of a bonus.

    </p>
    <p>If Yamamura does not report her discovery, However, Ryuen could use it as leverage to formulate a strategy.

    </p>
    <p>It probably won’t end with her just losing her role.

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t let him take advantage of you so easily.”

    </p>
    <p>“But…”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t want you to be expelled. So, I want you to accept my advice.”

    </p>
    <p>“W-Why? It’s not like you have anything to do with me.”

    </p>
    <p>“You’re my ally from the same group on the school trip. That’s enough of a relation between us, isn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>“...I…”

    </p>
    <p>She clasped both her hands and put them near her eyes.

    </p>
    <p>Then, she opened her eyes and started typing a message on her phone.

    </p>
    <p>“Ryuen-Kun and Katsuragi-kun discovered that I was tailing them. I will convey the details with a phone call.”

    </p>
    <p>She showed me the text, and sent it to Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>“I was afraid that I’d run away again if I hesitated, so.”

    </p>
    <p>So she cut off her escape route by reporting the matter here and now.

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, err. I think it’s time for me to leave now..!”

    </p>
    <p>Feeling uncomfortable, Yamamura hastily uttered these words.

    </p>
    <p>She gave me a deep, unnecessary bow before reservedly walking away.

    </p>
    <p>“You’re easier to talk to than I thought.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s exactly how I felt about Yamamura right after we parted as well.

    </p>
    <p>I wanted to tell her too, but I honestly don’t want her to be expelled.

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure Sakayanagi is not going to punish her for reporting the incident properly, but I think it would be best
        to keep an eye on her just in case.

    </p>
    <p>“Oh… Right. I should contact Horikita too.”

    </p>
    <p>A phone call would be too much trouble, so it would be best to quickly tell her the gist of it in a text message.

    </p>
    <p>Kei and Satou are also having fun in Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>I decided to leave the mall for now so as not to run into them.
    </p>
