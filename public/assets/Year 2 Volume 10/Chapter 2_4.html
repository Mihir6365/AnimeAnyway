    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        On my way back from Keyaki Mall, I found Morishita laying down on a bench.

    </p>
    <p>“What is that..?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei walking by my side also looked at her with surprise and a slightly creeped out expression.

    </p>
    <p>Since she isn’t even under warm sunlight, I can’t understand why she’s laying on a bench with her eyes closed.

    </p>
    <p>The snow may have melted, but we’re still in winter during the middle of January.

    </p>
    <p>“Is she dead?”

    </p>
    <p>While a low possibility, anything could be the case with Morishita.

    </p>
    <p>“Of course not.”

    </p>
    <p>Kei quickly said no.

    </p>
    <p>“Correct, I am not dead.”

    </p>
    <p>Morishita quickly sat up and looked up at us with sleepy eyes.

    </p>
    <p>Looks like she got sleepy.

    </p>
    <p>I’m surprised to see her lose to her sleepiness under such a cold sky.

    </p>
    <p>“What are you doing there?”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you curious?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t, but—”

    </p>
    <p>“Let me tell you, then. To be frank with you, I was waiting for Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.”

    </p>
    <p>Kei replied that she was a little curious, and Morishita quickly told her the reason.

    </p>
    <p>She is speaking respectfully, but I noted that she didn’t use an honorific while saying my name.

    </p>
    <p>“Wait, you know him?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well… Not exactly. We just talked once.”

    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 10/Images/image1.webp" alt="">

    <p>

        “Hmm? You know a lot of girls from other classes, huh, Kiyotaka-kun?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei grabbed my arm and looked up at me, almost like a teacher asking a question to her student.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not like I’m the one who started talking to her.”

    </p>
    <p>“It doesn’t matter who spoke first, does it? Talking with her is the problem.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s a pretty ridiculous opinion.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, I know that while these are her true feelings, she still isn’t being serious.

    </p>
    <p>“You said you were waiting for me, but what were you going to do if I didn’t talk to you?”

    </p>
    <p>I was fine with just ignoring her presence, and only ended up talking to her by coincidence.

    </p>
    <p>“No need to worry. It was only slightly, but I still had my eyes open and ready to notice you walking by.”

    </p>
    <p>If she wasn’t sleeping, then I don’t understand why she was laying down like that.

    </p>
    <p>I realize thinking too deeply about Morishita’s conduct is a loss of time.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s the reason you were waiting for me?”

    </p>
    <p>“What do you think it is?”

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t expect her to ask back like that…</p>
    <p>

        “I really have no idea.”

    </p>
    <p>“Actually, this is a surprise of good fortune. It’s about your girlfriend there.”

    </p>
    <p>“Wait, me?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei pointed at herself, surprised that this was related to her.

    </p>
    <p>“Yes. I’m interested in what kind of person you are.”

    </p>
    <p>“Interested? What do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>“I noticed something strange as I was looking into you.”

    </p>
    <p>Morishita quickly stood up and approached Kei with sleepy eyes.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, what are you doing?”

    </p>
    <p>Morishita has a unique aura about her, different from Hiyori’s.

    </p>
    <p>It’s different from calmness or peace; just ove. Kei must have also noticed this change in this short time, and
        seems a little creeped out.

    </p>
    <p>“Karuizawa Kei. You were dating Hirata Yousuke at first, weren’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>Oh, so she’s not using any honorifics for Kei or Yousuke either.

    </p>
    <p>“W-What about it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Why did you date Hirata Yousuke? No, rather, why did Hirata Yousuke date a woman like you in the first place?”

    </p>
    <p>Morishita started pacing around Kei like a detective questioning a criminal.

    </p>
    <p>“Wait a bit, what’s with this rude girl?”

    </p>
    <p>“I looked into Hirata Yousuke as well, in my own way, and he seems to be a very popular man in school. To say
        nothing of the fact that he is in the soccer club and that he has high academic ability, which are factors in
        his popularity, he is also blessed with good looks and treats both boys and girls gently, and he can study well
        too.”

    </p>
    <p>The way she was roundabout in saying some things drew my attention, but everything she said about Yousuke is a
        correct assessment.

    </p>
    <p>There is indeed no need to even say that he is a highly special student.

    </p>
    <p>He has a habit of going hard on himself and hurting his spirit, but that doesn’t need to be touched on.

    </p>
    <p>“Why would someone like him pick a slipshod girl like you?”

    </p>
    <p>“...What’s a slipshod?”

    </p>
    <p>“Who knows? It’s the first time I’m hearing that word.”

    </p>
    <p>I lied.

    </p>
    <p>It means someone who is reckless and irresponsible. Random. That’s the connotation this world comes with.

    </p>
    <p>It’ll cause trouble if I tell Kei now.

    </p>
    <p>Morishita poked the confused Kei’s cheek with her index finger and gently slid it across her face.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, don’t touch me.”

    </p>
    <p>“It looks like you’re holding back now, but you used to have the heaviest make-up when I first started here,
        despite only being a Year 1 student.”

    </p>
    <p>“I c-can do whatever I want, can’t I?”

    </p>
    <p>“Irresponsible, without any superior qualities, and heavy makeup. I really don’t understand why Hirata Yousuke
        chose you back then.”

    </p>
    <p>“Because I was cute, obviously?”

    </p>
    <p>She gave herself a convenient rating while ignoring the fact that she had seeked help from Yousuke as a
        camouflage to hide her past of being bullied.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s easy to understand when you put on a mask of heavy makeup. You’re the owner of a timid and delicate heart.
        However, that contradicts the fact that you have strong motivation to win and are the leader of the girls.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s certainly a strange person. However, it looks like this Morishita is a student who at least has enough
        brains to gather information and notice suspicious points.

    </p>
    <p>“What the hell is with you..?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei showed a reaction after being seen right through.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t think things will develop in a good direction if I allow these two to converse further.

    </p>
    <p>“I think logic doesn’t apply when it comes to romance. His feelings just coincided with Kei’s and they ended up
        dating. Is there a problem with that?”

    </p>
    <p>I approached closer to Kei in a protective stance and she happily squinted her eyes after hearing my words,
        though she was a little surprised.

    </p>
    <p>“I see. You’re right. I’ve never fallen in love, so. I can’t refute the fact that logic doesn’t apply there.”

    </p>
    <p>If love consisted solely of calculations, I wouldn’t have had to spend this much time on it.

    </p>
    <p>“I apologize for my various rude remarks. Karuizawa Kei.”

    </p>
    <p>She stood in front of Kei again and deeply… way too deeply bowed.

    </p>
    <p>Further, she kept her head low without moving.

    </p>
    <p>“Y-You don’t have to apologize like that, I get it.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh. Seeing as apologies are finished, then, can we say there’s no problem between us?”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh? Umm… I guess, but it feels a bit unnatural?”

    </p>
    <p>I can understand that feeling way too well, but I don’t think she can do anything about it.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t want to bother you any further, so I think we should end it here.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, that’s considerate… Maybe you are a good girl, after all?”

    </p>
    <p>The least difficult choice here is to make Morishita leave, but we don’t have many chances to come in contact
        with each other.

    </p>
    <p>I decided to go ahead and ask a question about something I had been wondering.

    </p>
    <p>“You’re pretty individualistic for a student of the Sakayanagi Class, huh? Do others say the same thing about
        you?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei was surprised to see me stop Morishita, but I ignored it and waited for an answer.

    </p>
    <p>“They do say that a lot. That I’m very individualistic.”

    </p>
    <p>Yeah.

    </p>
    <p>That’s the way she is, no matter which way you look at it.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s strange, though. I’ve always known that I was an individualistic person, and I’ve always thought I was
        special. I don’t especially love being recognized as an individualistic person, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry about that. It’s just that I’ve never seen anyone in Sakayanagi’s class who’s similar to you.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. You’re surprised to see that a student you expected to be impersonal is actually an individual.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s right.”

    </p>
    <p>“I never make the first move unless something interests me. I never had to do anything while Sakayanagi Arisu and
        Katsuragi Kouhei led the class as they protected everyone. Thanks to that, there’s also no necessity to show any
        individuality. I was in an environment where one could simply quietly pass the time and graduate. It may seem
        impersonal, but I think it can't be helped.”

    </p>
    <p>Not hiding her environment, she clearly explained why one might think she would be impersonal.

    </p>
    <p>Morishita’s explanation is a convincing one.

    </p>
    <p>Right now, I’m gathering enough attention that I’m catching the eye of students like Morishita.

    </p>
    <p>I intended on being an impersonal student who doesn’t stand out, like her, but I’m standing out and making people
        wary as much as Horikita does.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, this is also by my own volition, but I’m sure the situation would have been different if I was in
        Class-A like Morishita at the time of my enrollment, and Sakayanagi didn’t have any common points with me.
    </p>
    <p>In Class-A, one’s status is firmly built without them having to do anything in particular.

    </p>
    <p>That sounds very comfortable.

    </p>
    <p>I could have spent my days as an average student without any individuality.

    </p>
    <p>A path to graduation without being suspected by anyone or putting anyone on guard.

    </p>
    <p>Morishita was somewhat leisurely walking on this path of the quiet route.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m glad I saw you two today. Thank you for attending to someone like me.”

    </p>
    <p>“N-No, you’re welcome.”

    </p>
    <p>For some reason, Kei followed suit and also spoke politely.

    </p>
    <p>“Most of the students who enrolled in this school want to graduate in Class-A. I’m one of them, of course. That’s
        precisely why I think I should be wary of any risks and talk with all kinds of students. There are a lot of eyes
        on you right now, Ayanokoji Kiyotaka.”

    </p>
    <p>She gave a reply while more deeply explaining the reason she talked to me, making sure that Kei would hear it
        too.

    </p>
    <p>“I might need to come in contact with you again in the future, so please be nice to me if that time comes.
        Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, Karuizawa Kei.”

    </p>
    <p>She bowed way too deeply again and started walking away… then suddenly stopped.

    </p>
    <p>Then, she turned around.

    </p>
    <p>“You two were just leaving too, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, why..?”

    </p>
    <p>“I was going to return to my dorm too, so why don’t we go together? While chatting.”

    </p>
    <p>“H-Huh..? I thought we were done talking, but it’s starting again? I really don’t get you…”

    </p>
    <p>“This is a great opportunity, so please don’t refrain from asking me about myself either.”

    </p>
    <p>“But I’m really not interested..!”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t say that. Let’s at least exchange contact information. You too, of course, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, no, no, we’re not doing that! Right?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m fine with it, actually.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hey!”

    </p>
    <p>“What’s wrong with having one more friend?”

    </p>
    <p>“What a fine way to think about it. I completely agree.”

    </p>
    <p>“Uuh, Kiyotaka, it’s kinda hard to get angry at you for something so cute!”

    </p>
    <p>With that, while it displeased Kei, we ended up exchanging contact information.

    </p>
    <p>Chat apps are quite useful, and there’s no loss in getting to know each other.

    </p>
    <p>The one thing that did draw my attention is that there are only a few people saved in Morishita’s chat app.

    </p>
    <p>She really does seem to have lived a quiet life up until now, without making many friends.

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure a part of that is because she’s such a strange person, though.
