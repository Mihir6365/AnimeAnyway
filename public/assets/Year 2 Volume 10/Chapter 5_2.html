    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    
<p>
During our day off, I spent the morning at Keyaki Mall with Kei. 

</p><p>Despite occasionally voicing her concerns about the upcoming special exam, Kei seemed to be able to enjoy the day relatively peacefully. 

</p><p>Engaged in casual conversation, we made our way back to the dorm together.

</p><p>As we walked, my phone suddenly rang. Glancing at the caller ID, I saw Kanzaki's name. Kei leaned over to see who was calling, but upon recognizing the caller, she lost interest and took out her own phone. 

</p><p>Almost simultaneously, we both came to a halt, and I answered the call.

</p><p>“What's going on?” 

</p><p>“Where are you right now? I headed straight to your room, but it seems you haven't returned yet.” 

</p><p>“I'm on my way back. Is there something you need?”

</p><p>“Could you spare some time to talk? Watanabe and I will be there. Is that alright with you?”

</p><p>It was unusual for someone to visit my room without prior arrangement.

</p><p>“I'm almost back. Can you inform Watanabe as well?”

</p><p>“Okay. Can I wait in front of your room?”

</p><p>I agreed and ended the call. At the same time, Kei put away her phone.

</p><p>“What's going on with Kanzaki-kun and Watanabe-kun?”

</p><p>“I'm not sure. It seems they want to have a conversation. They're waiting in front of my room. I apologize, but I think we should call it a day.”

</p><p>“That's fine. But are you close to those two, Kiyotaka?”

</p><p>“I was in the same group as Watanabe during the school trip. I've been seeing him quite frequently lately.”

</p><p>“Oh, so you're making more friends.”

</p><p>Kei appeared both amazed and slightly pleased, offering a few subtle nods. We boarded the elevator together and got off on the fourth floor. 

</p><p>As the doors slid open, Watanabe and Kanzaki greeted us, their eyes catching ours, with Watanabe extending a wave.

</p><p>“See you later. Reach out anytime. And take your time.”

</p><p>Recognizing him as a friend, Kei reciprocated with a smile, conveying her amiable intentions without reservation. 

</p><p>Since our reconciliation, she seemed to have regained her composure.

</p><p>“Apologies for the sudden visit. Were you two planning to spend time together later?” 

</p><p>Kanzaki cautiously broached the topic as soon as we convened.

</p><p>“No need to apologize. It's uncommon for both of you to visit at once. Please, come inside.” 

</p><p>I welcomed them, unlocking the door and ushering them in. 

</p><p>Their surprised glances swept over the living room, now adorned with a distinctly feminine and colourful ambiance.

</p><p>Ensuring my guests felt at ease, I inquired about their beverage preferences before heading to the kitchen. 

</p><p>Shortly after, Kanzaki rose and approached me.

</p><p>“I was instructed to keep it under wraps initially, as they weren't sure if they could make it, but when I mentioned meeting up with you, they confirmed their availability. I apologize for the sudden addition, but may I invite two more people?”

</p><p>“Is that so? I'll have to adjust accordingly. Who's joining us?”

</p><p>“Ichinose and Amikura.”

</p><p>The increase in numbers didn't pose any particular issue, but I found myself puzzled by the dynamics of this group. 

</p><p>Kanzaki had taken on the role of a reformer, striving to influence both Ichinose and his class. 

</p><p>Conversely, Ichinose seemed adamant about maintaining the status quo, adopting a conservative stance. 

</p><p>Yet, despite being aware of Kanzaki's efforts, Ichinose remained passive. 

</p><p>Was I overanalyzing the situation? 

</p><p>The absence of Himeno and Hamaguchi, who typically supported Kanzaki, added to the intrigue.

</p><p>“The class strategy for the upcoming special exam is set and Ichinose mentioned wanting to go over some final checks with you. However, it might not be advantageous for you.”

</p><p>His tone carried a hint of apology, and I sensed his lack of enthusiasm for today's agenda.

</p><p>“I don't mind. But what brings Watanabe and Amikura here?”

</p><p>"Watanabe's presence was purely coincidental. I ran into him on the way here.”

</p><p>“Yeah, just a stroke of luck.”

</p><p>Had he somehow anticipated Amikura's arrival and decided to tag along? 

</p><p>Or was I overthinking things? 

</p><p>Ultimately, I decided not to dwell on it; the reason behind their visit didn't matter to me at that moment.

</p><p>I turned on the TV and engaged in casual conversation to while away the time. 

</p><p>About 15 minutes later, the doorbell rang, and as expected, Ichinose and Amikura arrived, bringing snacks from Keyaki Mall as a gift. 

</p><p>After serving drinks to everyone, I prepared to listen to what they had to say.

</p><p>“You may have already been informed by Kanzaki-kun, but I wanted to discuss tomorrow's special exam with you, Ayanokoji-kun. I apologize for the abrupt request.” 

</p><p>Her words suggested a premeditated decision rather than a spontaneous one.

</p><p>“I don't particularly mind, but I'm not the designated leader. If you're interested in our class's internal affairs or strategies, it's best to directly negotiate with Horikita.”

</p><p>“That's fine. Actually, I'd like you to hear our perspective first.”

</p><p>“Wait a moment. Before you proceed with Ayanokoji, there's something I'd like to address.”

</p><p>Kanzaki interjected, seizing the initiative to voice his concerns.

</p><p>“What is it?”

</p><p>“If you're considering collaboration or any similar arrangement, I'll firmly oppose it.”

</p><p>His lack of concern about the potential cooperation between our classes made it evident what he meant by 'collaborate.'

</p><p>“You're worried about the possibility of me equalizing the scores across all four classes, aren't you?”

</p><p>“To put it bluntly, yes, that's precisely it.”

</p><p>“Why didn't you bring up this issue during the class meeting?”

</p><p>“Even if I voiced my opposition to collusion, if you, Ichinose, approved of it, the majority of the class would likely agree. I wanted to prevent that scenario. If discussions were happening behind my back, I wouldn't have any say. However, if the discussion occurred in front of me, I could voice my objections.” 

</p><p>Kanzaki explained, shedding light on his strategic approach.

</p><p>This explained why he had avoided the topic until now, choosing not to raise it in a more private setting. 

</p><p>He had his reasons for keeping it under wraps.

</p><p>If I were assisting with the class's reform, I would align myself with those opposing collusion, provided I were present. 

</p><p>Surely, that was part of his calculation.

</p><p>“Isn't the special exam tomorrow? Isn't it a bit late to propose collaboration between the four classes now?” 

</p><p>Amikura, seated beside Ichinose, remarked, seemingly anticipating such skepticism.

</p><p>From a logical standpoint, it seemed indeed too late to make such a move.

</p><p>“Typically, yes. But knowing Ichinose, she might still be considering it until the last minute to avoid risking anyone's expulsion. She could change her stance at the eleventh hour to safeguard her classmates.”

</p><p>“If all four classes could coordinate and ensure a clear victory, her suggestion might hold merit. Even if it means losing class points, if all classes face the same outcome, it wouldn't be unfair. As Kanzaki-kun mentioned, there might still be a chance to make this plan work.”

</p><p>“However... If we miss the opportunity to advance—” 

</p><p>Kanzaki, preemptively concerned about such a possibility, began to argue, but Ichinose gently intervened.

</p><p>“Don't worry. I didn't come here to persuade Ayanokoji-kun to agree to this. If that were my intention, it would be appropriate to discuss it directly with Horikita-san.”

</p><p>Ichinose reassured him, alleviating his concerns. 

</p><p>However, Kanzaki seemed restless nonetheless.

</p><p>Even without explicit collusion, cooperating to avoid expulsion felt familiar. 

</p><p>If Ichinose remained dedicated to protecting her classmates at her own expense, it could diminish their chances of success.

</p><p>To conceal his anxiety, Kanzaki feigned a relieved expression rather clumsily.

</p><p>“That's a relief. I apologize for the abrupt interruption. I tend to struggle with conversations and often end up causing trouble.” 

</p><p>I reassured him that there was no need to worry.

</p><p>“Kanzaki-kun, you've become quite close to Ayanokoji-kun, haven't you?”

</p><p>“Really?” 

</p><p>Kanzaki responded, somewhat surprised.

</p><p>“Indeed. Your former self would have hesitated to discuss the class's internal affairs so openly. If it were Hirata-kun or Kaneda-kun here, your reaction would have been different.” 

</p><p>Ichinose observed, prompting a puzzled look from Kanzaki, although it was futile. 

</p><p>Around the time Kanzaki and Himeno began making moves together, Ichinose likely sensed a shift.

</p><p>“Let's not focus on that. Let's continue our conversation.” 

</p><p>She suggested, smiling at me before elaborating on her reason for approaching me before Horikita.

</p><p>Bracing myself for potentially weighty revelations, I found her intentions were rather simple. 

</p><p>She merely wanted to secure victory with her classmates and avoid defeat—a close-knit ambition. 

</p><p>Bringing along her close aide, Kanzaki, seemed unnecessary for such a goal.

</p><p>Even Kanzaki, who had been listening with a serious expression, relaxed his guard.

</p><p>The conversation then drifted into casual chit-chat, enlivened by Watanabe's presence, turning the reunion into a comfortable gathering of friends.

</p><p>As the clock approached six, and daylight dimmed outside, Kanzaki suggested concluding the gathering. 

</p><p>Ichinose, Amikura, and Kanzaki left first, followed by Watanabe.

</p><p>“I wasn't sure how today would turn out, but it ended up being quite enjoyable.”

</p><p>This sentiment was likely due to Watanabe being able to converse freely with Amikura. 

</p><p>When I subtly signalled him with my eyes, Watanabe responded with a wide smile.

</p><p>As the departing guests closed the front door behind them, silence settled in. 

</p><p>The TV, previously unobtrusive, suddenly felt too loud, prompting me to switch it off.

</p><p>Just as I was about to tidy up the remaining cups on the table, the doorbell rang with a distinct "ping-pong" sound. 

</p><p>Since I hadn't informed Kei about any visitors, I wondered who it could be.

</p><p>Curious, I opened the door to find Ichinose standing there, alone for some reason.

</p><p>“Apologies, Ayanokoji-kun. It seems I left my phone behind.”

</p><p>Initially suspicious, the reason for her return quickly became apparent—it appeared she had simply forgotten her phone.

</p><p>“Your phone? Where did you leave it? I'll retrieve it for you.”

</p><p>“I believe it's under the table. I'm really sorry about this.” 

</p><p>She replied apologetically.

</p><p>Forgetting one's phone wasn't an uncommon occurrence. 

</p><p>Given its daily necessity and frequent use, it was easy to overlook. However, it was also something one quickly remembered forgetting. 

</p><p>I recalled how Kei often left her phone in my room and then hurried back to retrieve it, slightly flustered.

</p><p>“Wait a moment.” 

</p><p>Leaving Ichinose waiting at the entrance, I swiftly checked under the table. 

</p><p>It didn't take long to spot her phone exactly where she had been seated moments ago. 

</p><p>Within about ten seconds, I retrieved it and handed it over to Ichinose.

</p><p>“Thank you. Sorry for the trouble again.” 

</p><p>“No problem. See you around.” 

</p><p>However, before she could leave, she hesitated. 

</p><p>“Oh, can we talk for a bit?”

</p><p>Despite already engaging in a substantial conversation, girls often had more to say. 

</p><p>So, with comprehension rather than surprise, I agreed to her request.

</p><p>“People might misunderstand if they see us alone together, so should I lock the door?” 

</p><p>She suggested, contemplating privacy but then reconsidering. 

</p><p>“No, It’s not a good idea. If the door was locked and later someone saw us... That would be bad.”

</p><p>However, she quickly rescinded the idea, realizing the potential consequences. 

</p><p>Locking the door with only the two of us inside could imply secrecy, something we didn't want to insinuate.

</p><p>While it was innocent for two people to be alone together, the presence of her classmates just moments ago made the situation seem ordinary. 

</p><p>However, locking the door under the same circumstances would drastically alter perceptions, suggesting some activity we wished to conceal.

</p><p>“Mako-chan and the others just left. I made sure to inform them that I left my phone in your room, so even if someone happens to see us now, we have a solid alibi.” 

</p><p>Ichinose explained, addressing me rather than speaking to herself.

</p><p>As she attempted to lock the door, she paused, vocalizing her thoughts aloud. 

</p><p>“Did you intentionally leave your phone behind to have some privacy with me?” 

</p><p>I questioned, unsure if she was aiming for this response or not.

</p><p>Ichinose simply smiled in response to my inquiry. 

</p><p>“What do you think, Ayanokoji-kun?” 

</p><p>She countered, turning the question back to me unexpectedly.

</p><p>“My suspicions were probably correct. Your 'forgetting' was deliberate.” 

</p><p>I concluded, observing her reaction as she nodded in acknowledgment.

</p><p>“I wanted to spend time with you, Ayanokoji-kun. Just the two of us, in any way possible... Do you think I'm being unreasonable?” 

</p><p>Ichinose's tone shifted to one of vulnerability.

</p><p>“Why would you think that?”

</p><p>“Because... I went out of my way to see a boy who already has a girlfriend.”

</p><p>While it might be more easily understandable if the genders were reversed, her actions could still be misconstrued. 

</p><p>If the recipient didn't reciprocate her feelings, she could be perceived as overly forward or even as a stalker.

</p><p>Ultimately, how her actions were perceived depended entirely on my perspective. 

</p><p>If I didn't welcome her attention, she might be labelled as intrusive. 

</p><p>But if I appreciated her company, her actions would likely be viewed differently.

</p><p>“It's unusual for you to boldly pursue a guy who already has a girlfriend. In fact, it shows consideration on your part.” 

</p><p>If she had insisted on visiting against all odds, reconciling with Kei would have been challenging, potentially worsening our circumstances. 

</p><p>However, if this situation had arisen naturally, it could be explained as an unavoidable circumstance.

</p><p>“Really? You truly don't find me repulsive?”

</p><p>“Yeah.” 

</p><p>I confirmed my thoughts by focusing on one thing when I looked at the current Ichinose—she was becoming an increasingly intriguing individual. 

</p><p>That was all.

</p><p>Moments later, she slowly approached and leaned against my chest. 

</p><p>“This was just an accident... I lost my footing, and you happened to catch me, right?”

</p><p>“Yeah. There's no evidence to suggest otherwise.” 

</p><p>I replied, sensing her smile even if I couldn't see it.

</p><p>“I love you, Ayanokoji-kun. I'm hopelessly in love with you... It's strange—I've never experienced love before, but I have a strong suspicion that this might be my first and last love.” 

</p><p>She confessed, revealing a side of herself that was previously unimaginable.

</p><p>Despite her evolving strategies and newfound assertiveness, one thing remained unchanged—Ichinose's unwavering generosity. 

</p><p>It was a quality that continued to captivate others, regardless of gender.

</p><p>I had orchestrated various elements, including Kanzaki and Himeno, to stir up some commotion, but the unfolding events presented more avenues for development than I had anticipated. 

</p><p>Surprisingly, this wasn't a setback but rather an opportunity. 

</p><p>It allowed me to approach the improvement of their class from multiple angles. 

</p><p>Initially, there was only a single straight line of action with a high risk of failure. 

</p><p>To increase the chances of the class's survival, I charted a new course. 

</p><p>However, Ichinose introduced complexity to this high-risk path. 

</p><p>Now, it was challenging to assess whether this modified trajectory, essentially a new line, would lead to success or failure.

</p><p>As I pondered, a captivating scent emanated from Ichinose's hair—a fragrance that defied description, distinct from typical hair products.

</p><p>“If we weren't in different classes, we could have spent more time together.”

</p><p>But our moment was abruptly interrupted as my room door swung open without warning. 

</p><p>“Sorry, Ayanokoji, could you give me some personal advice?” 

</p><p>Watanabe, from Class B, barged in, catching us off guard.

</p><p>Ichinose must have anticipated such a situation, remaining vigilant for unexpected visitors. 

</p><p>However, even she didn't expect someone to enter without so much as a knock. 

</p><p>My body tensed at the unexpected intrusion, and Ichinose, caught in the clingy situation, looked back in surprise.

</p><p>“What—!?” 

</p><p>Watanabe himself seemed taken aback, his gasp louder than anyone else's. Seconds stretched into what felt like ages.

</p><p>The warmth from Ichinose's close proximity dissipated with the sudden interruption, making it impossible to dismiss the physical contact as mere coincidence. 

</p><p>The excuse of nearly falling wouldn't hold water.

</p><p>While Watanabe struggled to grasp the situation initially, his confusion wouldn't last forever. 

</p><p>Both Ichinose and I understood the gravity of the situation. 

</p><p>Watanabe's response would dictate our next course of action.

</p><p>With the situation out of my control, I had no choice but to entrust the outcome to the two of them.

</p><p>“Um, sorry, I didn't knock... so, um, I'll be going.” 

</p><p>Watanabe stammered, faced with the awkwardness of the situation, opting to make a swift exit.

</p><p>As Watanabe attempted to close the door, Ichinose acted swiftly, preventing it from shutting completely by placing her hand on it.

</p><p>“Watanabe-kun.” 

</p><p>She called out, causing him to straighten up in response.

</p><p>“Yes?” 

</p><p>Watanabe replied, slightly startled by her formal address.

</p><p>“Can you come in?” 

</p><p>Ichinose requested, her tone gentle but firm.

</p><p>“But I'm intruding, and my business isn't anything major!”

</p><p>“Please, can you come in?”

</p><p>“Y-yes.”

</p><p>I couldn't see Ichinose's expression as she faced Watanabe, but I imagined it was her usual smile that she displayed to everyone when she turned around. There was no indication of her being flustered or upset. Despite undoubtedly being caught off guard by Watanabe's unexpected intrusion, she quickly composed herself and determined the next course of action.

</p><p>She guided Watanabe into the entrance area and, after obtaining my approval, locked the door.

</p><p>Unable to lock the door previously, Ichinose resolved the issue with Watanabe inside, bringing a sense of relief to the situation. 

</p><p>Her ability to handle the emergency calmly, contrary to the typical response of losing one's composure, was truly commendable.

</p><p>“Come in.” 

</p><p>I invited, acknowledging the cramped space in the entrance area with all three of us present. 

</p><p>Deciding to provide more room, I gestured for Ichinose and Watanabe to enter the main room.

</p><p>Watanabe's tense expression betrayed his emotions, though neither party appeared to be in a state of panic. 

</p><p>It was only natural for him to feel apprehensive in contrast to our composed demeanour.

</p><p>The room fell unusually quiet, accentuated by the absence of the television's background noise. 

</p><p>Watanabe, who had taken a seat on his own accord, seemed subdued.

</p><p>“Regarding what happened earlier, it was my doing alone. Ayanokoji-kun bears no responsibility.” 

</p><p>Ichinose clarified, addressing Watanabe with a calm yet assertive tone.

</p><p>“Y-yes, of course.”

</p><p>“Although, I must say, your use of formal language is a bit off-putting.”

</p><p>"S-sorry..." 

</p><p>Watanabe apologized, visibly uncomfortable.

</p><p>“I acted independently when I hugged him. Given that you witnessed the situation, I trust you understand.” 

</p><p>Ichinose continued, her reasoning met with repeated nods of acknowledgment from Watanabe.

</p><p>“I realize my actions were inappropriate. While you're under no obligation to keep this a secret, I believe you're not one to act with malice. I trust you won't spread this story to harm others.” 

</p><p>Ichinose appealed to Watanabe's sense of guilt, attempting to contain him through his remorse rather than through threats.

</p><p>“I'm truly sorry, Ayanokoji-kun. I acted impulsively.” 

</p><p>“It's alright.”

</p><p>“I'm concerned about Karuizawa-san's reaction if she were to find out... She'd be deeply upset. I'm prepared to face any consequences.” 

</p><p>Ichinose expressed her readiness to accept responsibility for her actions, acknowledging the potential repercussions.

</p><p>Ichinose had effectively quelled 99% of Watanabe's impulses, leaving only a sliver to address. 

</p><p>Her words and psychological insight were impeccable, but the extent of her sincerity versus calculated strategy remained ambiguous.

</p><p>After a brief period of silence, I felt compelled to break the tension that hung in the air.

</p><p>“Anyway, you two should head home for today.” 

</p><p>I suggested, prompting them to leave. 

</p><p>Ichinose seemed to have been awaiting these words, as she promptly acknowledged them. 

</p><p>Surprisingly, however, Watanabe remained seated, showing no intention of getting up. 

</p><p>While he appeared panicked earlier, he now exuded a sense of calmness. 

</p><p>I couldn't help but wonder what was going through his mind.

</p><p>“Watanabe?” 

</p><p>I called out his name, prompting him to draw a deep sigh and glance between me and Ichinose.

</p><p>“I admit my fault. Failing to knock before entering someone's room is a breach of etiquette. I don't believe such an incident guarantees silence... I returned because I needed to discuss something with Ayanokoji. Alongside that, would you mind hearing a story from my junior high days?” 

</p><p>He requested, his tone a mix of apology and eagerness.

</p><p>I hadn't inquired about Watanabe's return, but I obliged nonetheless. 

</p><p>“I suppose I'll take my leave then.” 

</p><p>Ichinose responded, making a move to exit.

</p><p>“W-wait. Ichinose, if you're willing... I'd appreciate your input on my story too.” 

</p><p>Watanabe implored, catching Ichinose off guard.

</p><p>Despite the suddenness of the request, Ichinose, unlikely to refuse, hesitated in stepping out.

</p><p>Thus, a consultation began. 

</p><p>Watanabe delved into his past, recounting a pivotal moment from his junior high days.

</p><p>“When I was in my second year of junior high, I had a significant encounter. I quickly befriended a girl after our classes were reshuffled. Our seating arrangement was the first connection. She found me intriguing, and we grew closer over time. We were even placed in the same group during a school trip, and I believed it was fate.”

</p><p>His love story. It might not have been his first love, but it was clear from his 
demeanour that it was a significant one for Watanabe.

</p><p>“At the time, I even entertained the possibility that she might have harboured feelings for me, given our closeness. However, I was completely unaware... she was actually in a relationship with a guy from the next class. Ignorant of this fact, my affection for her only grew stronger.”

</p><p>His account hinted at unrequited feelings, a sentiment familiar to many, regardless of gender.

</p><p>“I would call her every day, engaging in meaningless conversations late into the night.” 

</p><p>He continued, his expression tinged with bitterness.

</p><p>“But one night, our conversation took a significant turn. She confessed that she liked me. I was overjoyed... Yet, when she asked for my feelings, I couldn't find the words. It took me five minutes to muster the courage to reciprocate.” 

</p><p>He confessed, his laughter tinged with irony and self-deprecation.

</p><p>“She was involved with someone else before you, correct?” 

</p><p>My initial assumption was that she was seeing both of them simultaneously, but Watanabe refuted that. 

</p><p>He explained that she had been dumped by her previous partner before they began talking. 

</p><p>Although he wasn't sure of the exact timing, it seemed their relationship had soured around the time she started communicating with him. 

</p><p>Essentially, she developed feelings for Watanabe once she was completely single, which seemed like a natural progression without any complications.

</p><p>At the time, Watanabe wasn't aware of her past relationships, but she fell for him after being disappointed by her previous partner. 

</p><p>Watanabe was thrilled about this, unaware of the context. 

</p><p>Subsequently, they started dating secretly during their middle school years, exchanging messages and occasionally visiting each other's homes, experiencing what seemed like a smooth relationship.

</p><p>Watanabe admitted they shared a couple of kisses, though it was she who initiated them. 

</p><p>He appeared slightly embarrassed rather than reserved about it. 

</p><p>However, their fate took a turn when they entered their third year and ended up in different classes due to a reshuffle. 

</p><p>In Watanabe's new class was a male friend from elementary school who developed feelings for the girl, which spelled trouble.

</p><p>‘I’m sorry, we can’t date anymore...’</p><p>

Ultimately, she tearfully apologized to Watanabe over the phone, explaining they couldn't continue dating. 

</p><p>This came shortly after she had expressed her feelings for him over the phone. 

</p><p>The situation seemed almost comical to Watanabe, the rollercoaster of emotions she put him through.

</p><p>Following their breakup, she began dating Watanabe's close friend, which was undoubtedly challenging for him. 

</p><p>He found it particularly hurtful when his friend casually mentioned dumping her a few months later. 

</p><p>Since Watanabe and the girl's relationship was kept secret, his friend probably didn't realize the impact of his actions, though it's not impossible that he did it maliciously.

</p><p>“I’m shy about love... I thought I would never fall for anyone, but then I fell for another girl as soon as I entered this school... Who knows, right?”

</p><p>Reflecting on his experiences, Watanabe confessed that he was initially hesitant about love but found himself falling for another girl soon after starting school. 

</p><p>Despite his positive and cheerful demeanour, his past was marked by memories that left a lasting impression.

</p><p>In the end, Watanabe opened up about his past, sharing it as an act of trust. 

</p><p>He made it clear that he wouldn't divulge today's conversation to anyone, offering an exchange of secrets as the best he could do. 

</p><p>It was a vulnerable moment for him, showing a side of himself he didn't often reveal.

</p><p>“Today's discussion was initially going to revolve around... well, my feelings for a certain girl. Nothing substantial has unfolded, but you know how it is sometimes; you just need to talk things out with friends, right?”

</p><p>Amikura was the main focus of his attention today. 

</p><p>Was she observing me? Did she find my narrative engaging? 

</p><p>It seemed like he wanted reassurance on those fronts.

</p><p>“I actually planned on heading back right away, but Ichinose-san forgot her phone, causing a slight delay in my schedule... I never anticipated you'd stay…”

</p><p>Undoubtedly, it must have been quite chaotic for Watanabe.

</p><p>Amikura and Himeno had mentioned to Watanabe that Ichinose might harbour feelings for me. 

</p><p>While that aspect didn't come as a surprise, it wasn't the central point of our conversation.

</p><p>“My unrequited affection. That's all it is, plain and simple. It's common knowledge among Mako-chan and Chihiro-chan that I have feelings for Ayanokoji-kun.”

</p><p>She confessed openly, almost as if the secret was too burdensome to conceal any longer. 

</p><p>But, as previously mentioned, this detail wasn't exactly covert, it was widely known, so it hardly constituted a revelation.

</p><p>“I just happened to return for something I'd forgotten, on a whim…”

</p><p>“I see... On a whim…”

</p><p>Watanabe seemed to grasp the situation, albeit with a hint of confusion. 

</p><p>Understandable, considering Ichinose stood before him, the weight of her evident love, whether unrequited or not.

</p><p>“I believe I have a better understanding of you now, Watanabe-kun. You have feelings for Mako-chan, don't you?”

</p><p>“W-what!? H-how did you...!?”

</p><p>“It's rather apparent when you consider it. Lately, your focus has been particularly fixated on Mako-chan.”

</p><p>It wasn't just Ichinose who noticed, anyone present at our gathering today would have observed the intensity of Watanabe's gaze and his unmistakable love for Amikura.

</p><p>“Mako-chan appears to still hold feelings for her middle school classmate, yet she also desires to explore new romantic prospects. While uncertain about whom Mako-chan's affections will ultimately be directed towards, as her closest friend, I believe I can trust you.”

</p><p>This proposition from Ichinose was an affectionate gesture. 

</p><p>While Watanabe sought forgiveness through divulging his past secrets, Ichinose was strategizing, offering insights into Amikura's current situation and subtly suggesting she could facilitate a connection between them.

</p><p>Watanabe was hesitant in matters of love, but his feelings for Amikura were sincere. 

</p><p>It was precisely because of his genuineness that he lacked the courage to make advances.

</p><p>With Ichinose's assistance, however, he saw her as an invaluable asset, a potent ally. 

</p><p>Their bond of trust had escalated from 100% to 120%, with Ichinose wielding significant influence over Watanabe's emotions.

</p><p>“R-really? Are you certain?”

</p><p>“Absolutely. Firstly, you'll need to gradually bridge the gap with Mako-chan.” 

</p><p>“R-right!” 

</p><p>Watanabe responded eagerly. 

</p><p>Although he likely harboured lingering guilt for inadvertently witnessing something he shouldn't have, it was a stain that would gradually fade.

</p><p>A love triangle. 

</p><p>A forbidden intrigue. 

</p><p>These elements were ultimately someone else's concern, transient and titillating. 

</p><p>Should Watanabe impulsively reveal this matter, Ichinose would become an enemy. 

</p><p>However, if he kept it confidential, she would remain an ally. 

</p><p>Given the clear advantages, it was only natural to desire such an outcome.

</p><p>Ultimately, whether Ichinose and I endured the trials of a tragic love triangle held little significance as long as Watanabe's own romantic aspirations thrived. 

</p><p>The goal was to manage a potentially precarious situation and steer it towards a favourable outcome.

</p><p>Ichinose took note of Kanzaki and the others' suspicious behaviour. 

</p><p>Watanabe, previously aligned with Kanzaki's reformist faction, had now fully allied himself with Ichinose. 

</p><p>It was a challenging decision for me.

</p><p>Originally, I had intended to prompt Kanzaki to instigate a change within the class. 

</p><p>However, it could be argued that Ichinose had already initiated these changes inadvertently. 

</p><p>The outcome of these actions, whether they would result in class unity or chaos, remained uncertain.

</p><p>Given this uncertainty, perhaps it would be best to adopt a wait-and-see approach until the end of the school year.
