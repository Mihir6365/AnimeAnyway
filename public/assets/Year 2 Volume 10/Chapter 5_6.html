    <h3>Part 6</h3><p>
When I got home after that, I picked up the books I had brought home with my cold hands.

</p><p>What to read first..? 

</p><p>I thought about it for a while, but I knew that the book I would be talking about tomorrow in the library would be the one I received. 

</p><p>So, I decided to start with Hiyori’s present.

</p><p>The book itself wasn’t old, and seemed to have been released about 15 years ago.

</p><p>I was curious why Hiyori liked it, so I looked up the author’s history and found that he was just one of many unknown authors. 

</p><p>He seems to write some interesting works that have a small fan base, but his reputation isn’t very high. 

</p><p>Perhaps Hiyori managed to find a hidden masterpiece because she is a book lover. 

</p><p>She even bought the same book again just to keep it with her. 

</p><p>He still releases a new book every three years or so, it seems. 

</p><p>I’ll read another one next time if this suits my tastes. 

</p><p>“Hm..?” 

</p><p>I noticed there was a piece of paper inside when I was just about to start reading the book.

</p><p>That in itself is not a big deal, but what caught my attention was the design.

</p><p>You can sometimes get a free piece of paper as part of a campaign when you shop at Keyaki Mall, and the illustrations or patterns on it change depending on the time of the year. 

</p><p>The one I picked up had a Christmas image with fir trees and snow. 

</p><p>It was the one that came with the books I bought at the bookstore before Christmas. 

</p><p>The fact that it changed right after Christmas suggests this was bought before then. 

</p><p>It would be a shame if she had to carry it with her everyday since then. 

</p><p>She said it was only a few days ago out of consideration, but it’s more likely that she purchased it at a date a little further back. 

</p><p>“I feel like I might have gotten something very heavy.”

</p><p>Of course, I can’t be too quick to judge. 

</p><p>She may have simply given it to me as a gift from a book lover.

</p><p>I’m not going to think too much about it now, but it’s only natural as a human being to feel good if someone approaches you in a sincere manner. 

</p><p>What can I do for Hiyori, I wonder?

</p><p>I decided to sit and think about it before reading the book.
