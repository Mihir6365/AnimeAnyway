    <h3>Part 5</h3>
    <p>
        I met up with Sakayanagi, who was waiting for me standing in the lobby of the dorms, and we went outside
        together.

    </p>
    <p>It’s not likely that we’ll see other students right away at this time of the day.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s pretty cold out, after all.”

    </p>
    <p>It started snowing just on Christmas Eve, and it was piling up pretty solidly, perhaps due to the low
        temperatures.

    </p>
    <p>The snowfall was so heavy that it made it difficult to walk, but Sakayanagi seemed to be enjoying it rather than
        being troubled by it.

    </p>
    <p>“It would be a nuisance if it snowed all year round, but it’s a beautiful environment when you can enjoy it from
        time to time.”

    </p>
    <p>“Isn’t it inconvenient, though? When the snow is piled up like this.”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course, it makes it harder to walk. There is no need to worry about it, though. I’ve had experience in much
        harder conditions during our school trips.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi showed me her confidence and began to give a lecture on walking with a stick in heavy snow.

    </p>
    <p>Her tone of voice was happy and joyful, as if she was unveiling a strategy.

    </p>
    <p>However, from what I could see from the side, it seemed very dangerous.

    </p>
    <p>Just as I thought so, Sakayanagi almost lost her balance when she tried to pull out her cane after it got stuck
        in the snow.

    </p>
    <p>I had thought about this beforehand, so I held her shoulder to stop her before it became a big problem.

    </p>
    <p>“Be careful.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hehe.”

    </p>
    <p>I thought she’d be shaken after almost falling down, but she just laughed.

    </p>
    <p>“This is the kind of person you are, Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hmm?”

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t understand that, but it seems to have made Sakayanagi even happier.

    </p>
    <p>“I was confident that I could walk well, but there’s definitely a bigger risk of falling down if I do something
        reckless. However, I knew that you would save me if I failed.”

    </p>
    <p>Her thoughts then came true when I actually reached out with a helping hand.
    </p>
    <p>Is that why she suddenly laughed?

    </p>
    <p>“Pretty brave of you, since there was no guarantee of that happening.”

    </p>
    <p>It was like trying to bungee jump with no lifeline.

    </p>
    <p>Still, I guess there’s no risk of injury with such a perfect net of snow to catch her.

    </p>
    <p>“So why did you invite me out for a night walk? Is there something you want to tell me?”

    </p>
    <p>“Do you think there is?”

    </p>
    <p>When I nodded, Sakayanagi smiled as usual and asked me:

    </p>
    <p>“How does the current A Class look from your point of view?”

    </p>
    <p>“What do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>“I was wondering if you could tell me what you think are the strengths and weaknesses of A Class.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. That’s an unexpected question.”

    </p>
    <p>“Is it?”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi has absolute confidence in herself.

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t think that she’d ask me for advice that might affect the class’ policies.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m going to make a big assumption here, but do you think I’m going to <a class="tooltip"
            data-tooltip="Expression, helping your enemy out.">send salt to the
            enemy?</a>”

    </p>

    <p>“I guess there’s no helping it if you perceive A Class as your enemy.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi chuckled a little, showing that she was glad to hear that answer.

    </p>
    <p>“I think you’re going to give me an answer, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“Shall I ask why?”

    </p>
    <p>“When I look at your actions in an objective way, it’s pretty easy to guess most things.”

    </p>
    <p>It seems that Sakayanagi already has a vision of the things I’m thinking about.

    </p>
    <p>She’s always acted like that, but I never knew how confident she was about it.

    </p>
    <p>“If you can say that so assertively, then there’s no need for me to make any general comments about A Class, is
        there? Or do you need my endorsement to be confident in your ideas?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s a foolish question.”

    </p>
    <p>However, I decided to put it into words anyway.

    </p>
    <p>The A Class is fighting effectively under Sakayanagi’s guidance.

    </p>
    <p>They discarded what needed to be discarded, and picked up what needed to be picked up.

    </p>
    <p>They’re a class that’s steadily and solidly accumulating class points.

    </p>
    <p>Their overall academic ability is high, and their physical ability is average but not bad.

    </p>
    <p>Their only disadvantage is that they currently have no students with any special skills.

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi, who was walking next to me, accepted my words honestly and without argument.

    </p>
    <p>“Honestly, anyone would give the same answer.”

    </p>
    <p>“Can you give me some words of your own, then?”

    </p>
    <p>“Hmm…”

    </p>
    <p>It’s going to be a little harsh, but it looks like this is what Sakayanagi wants.

    </p>
    <p>“You’re confident in yourself. Indeed, it’s true that you’re a head above the others when compared to the other
        class leaders. However, that’s precisely why I get the impression that you’re a step behind in building
        relationships with your classmates.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s in control, but at the end of the day, she’s just controlling others.

    </p>
    <p>A Class students should have more individual will, which would lead to the improvement of the class.

    </p>
    <p>For that to happen, Sakayanagi, the monarch, has to befriend her classmates.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think I need to do that. I want to make decisions without emotion. I’m going to develop feelings for the
        others if I get close to them. Hesitation to discard a beloved pet leads to weakness.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s up to you.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s not wrong.

    </p>
    <p>That strength coming from her aloofness is also an excellent weapon.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way, there’s something on my mind.”

    </p>
    <p>“What would that be?”

    </p>
    <p>“Why are you keeping an eye on me? I’ve been feeling the A Class’ eyes a lot on me lately. If you have something
        on your mind, you can just ask me directly like you’re doing right now.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s not true. I haven’t ordered anyone to get in contact with you.”

    </p>
    <p>She firmly denied that point.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no point in having a third party probe into the affairs of someone as unique as you, since you haven’t
        shown such a strong resistance to drawing attention lately. I’m sure that those who have realized a glimpse of
        your potential are already starting to look into you on their own. Many people are devotedly giving me reports
        about you, even though I haven’t asked them to.”

    </p>
    <p>The contents of such reports are insignificant, and do not contain anything that would be beneficial to
        Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>I suppose that’s precisely why she asserted that there is no point in it.

    </p>
    <p>“So they're doing it voluntarily because they're thinking of the class?”

    </p>
    <p>“I suppose it's also meant to score points against me, but they're still a long way off if they can't realize
        that it's pointless.”

    </p>
    <p>No matter how many useful deeds they do, they're not going to earn Sakayanagi's favour.

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi continued walking down the snow with her cane, poking holes in the snow as it crunched.

    </p>
    <p>There’s still no signs of anyone else around.

    </p>
    <p>“Shall we stop our walk here?”

    </p>
    <p>“Let’s go back, then.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yes. I’d like you to go back first, though. I’m going to enjoy the night breeze a little more.”

    </p>
    <p>“Isn’t it dangerous?”

    </p>
    <p>“Even if I fall down, it’s just snow on the ground, and this isn’t a snow mountain.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s true. I’m sure she’s not going to be in any distress.

    </p>
    <p>“We may not see each other again before the end of the year. Have a good New Year’s.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. Have a good New Year’s.”

    </p>
    <p>We celebrated each other’s New Year’s and parted ways.

    </p>
    <p>I stomped down the snowy road towards my dorm.

    </p>
    <p>I probably took about ten steps without hearing Sakayanagi walk.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>She gently called my name, and I turned around.

    </p>
    <p></p>

    <p>
    <p>
        She looked at me with a scarf around her mouth while looking cold.

    </p>
    <p>“What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“I have something to tell you. Can you listen to me from there?”

    </p>
    <p>“So you did leave out the main subject, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi and I faced each other with some distance between us and restarted our conversation.

    </p>
    <p>“Did you know that there was still something I wanted to say?”

    </p>
    <p>“Somehow, yeah.”

    </p>
    <p>“There are times when I need courage too. This distance is inspiring that courage.”

    </p>
    <p>A distance of barely 10 meters.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m falling in love with you.”

    </p>
    <p>Such were her words.

    </p>
    <p>“Not as a human, but as someone from the opposite sex.”

    </p>
    <p>I quietly listened to these words, which could be taken as a confession.

    </p>
    <p>“Can you just keep that in mind for me?”

    </p>
    <p>“You don’t need a reply?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yes. I don’t want one right now. You may leave now.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see.”

    </p>
    <p>I was about to turn around again, but stopped.

    </p>
    <p>“Can I say one thing?”

    </p>
    <p>“What would that be?”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t look like it, but I think more highly of you than you think I do. That’s why I want to ask.”

    </p>
    <p>I really want to know something right now.

    </p>
    <p>“Can you turn that feeling into strength instead of weakness?”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi is wise, I’m sure she will understand.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s a foolish question, is it not?”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi replied with a smile. Her strongly coloured eyes were shining brightly in the darkness.
