    <h3>Part 5</h3>
    <p>
        Both Sudou and Yousuke have been involved in club activities since the beginning of Year One and have continued
        to produce good results.

    </p>
    <p>It’s a wonder how time flies, as both of them will be retired by this time next year.

    </p>
    <p>I recall a conversation I had with Kiryuuin at the end of the year.

    </p>
    <p>I haven’t had a single major regret in my school life up to this point, but I sometimes think about another
        future I could have if I was involved in club activities.

    </p>
    <p>Aside from the question of whether or not I would take it seriously, I think my school life might have been more
        glamorous if I was involved in basketball or soccer with like-minded people.

    </p>
    <p>It’s easy to imagine, but the probability of that future is zero.

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t know how to socialize, and the hurdles to jump into club activities were too high for someone who
        couldn’t make friends with others in a short period of time.

    </p>
    <p>I decided to go home and read the book I got from Hiyori.

    </p>
    <p>Then…

        “Please wait.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hm?”

    </p>
    <p>I was stopped by a girl with a polite but high-pressure tone in her voice.

    </p>
    <p>I turned around to see her standing there looking at me with her long scarf swaying in the wind.

“I want to talk to you for a bit.”

</p><p>I’m a little confused about someone with whom I haven’t had any contact before talking to me now.

</p><p>Actually, I encountered such a situation several times last year. 

</p><p>At times like this, I’m truly grateful for the OAA system which was Nagumo’s idea. 

</p><p>It’s easy to match a name with a face and to know the superficial abilities of that person. 

</p><p>The student who showed up before me was a student from Year-Two A class, which Sakayanagi is a member of. 

</p><p>Her name is Morishita Ai. 

</p><p>Her OAA is as follows:

</p><p>Academic Ability: B+
Physical Ability: C+
Quick Thinking: B+
Social Contribution: B
Overall Ability: B

To put it in simple terms, she’s the honour student type. 

</p><p>The data shows that she is someone who can handle all matters as well as or better than others. 

</p><p>She’s similar to Sanada, whom I met the other day, but there are many students like her in A Class. 

</p><p>“You’re Ayanokoji Kiyotaka, right?” 

</p><p>“Yeah.” 

</p><p>Naturally Morishita, who started talking to me, knows who I am. 

</p><p>Wait, did she just refer to me without an honorific?

</p><p>I don’t mind it regardless of age, but I was a little bothered by it because I thought she was being polite. 

</p><p>Before I could say anything, Morishita continued.

</p><p>“We’ll draw attention here. Let’s change the location please.”

</p><p>The school, the dorms, Keyaki Mall. 

</p><p>You have to go through here to go anywhere else, it certainly is a conspicuous spot. 

</p><p>It’s also an efficient place to ambush someone if you’re looking for them. 

</p><p>“Let’s go somewhere else.”

</p><p>Morishita quickly turned around and started walking.

</p><p>I never told her if I would follow her or not, but it’s okay. 

</p><p>It’s the winter break, I have the time to enjoy unexpected encounters like this.

</p><p>“This is the first time we’re meeting, right?” 

</p><p>“Yes. We have never talked before.”

</p><p>Morishita replied without looking back.

</p><p>She turned off the road on the way to the dormitory and stopped at a side street. 

</p><p>It was cold, and there wasn’t anyone else around. 

</p><p>“So, what are we going to talk about?” 

</p><p>I wonder what’s coming my way at the beginning of the New Year.  

</p><p>“I haven’t decided yet.” 

</p><p>“You haven’t decided?” 

</p><p>I was trying to prepare myself, but I was left a little disappointed.

</p><p>“I haven’t decided what we’re going to talk about, but I’ve been wanting to talk to you for a while.” 

</p><p>…I knew it wasn’t my imagination. 

</p><p>She called me by my first name and didn’t even use any honorifics. 

</p><p>However, she was otherwise polite and I got the impression that her high-pressure was very conspicuous.

</p><p>I don’t know if it’s just me or if it’s the same for other students, but since it’s hard for me to touch on that part, I’m going to ignore it now. 

</p><p>I seem to have a strange connection with students in other classes recently. 

</p><p>“Was it weird for me to talk to you?” 

</p><p>“Well, I guess. I’ve never had any contact with you before.” 

</p><p>“Yeah.” 

</p><p>“Also, when it’s someone of the opposite gender, I can’t help but think about a lot of strange possibilities.” 

</p><p>I made a comment that hinted at a sexual affair to see how she would react. 

</p><p>I thought she might be upset, and she did show some signs of distress, but remained calm. 

</p><p>She immediately set the direction of our conversation and started speaking.

</p><p>“It’s not my first time speaking for the first time to someone I don’t know.” 

</p><p>“Hm?”

</p><p>“I spoke to Sudou Ken the day before yesterday, and Kouenji Rokusuke yesterday.”

</p><p>She put up her palm, telling me not to misunderstand things.

</p><p>“I’ve learned that a man and woman talking alone can lead to misunderstandings, so I wanted to let you know in advance.”

</p><p>She put it into words so clearly that I can now rule that out. 

</p><p>I’m grateful for that. 

</p><p>Other than that, I also know that I’m not the only person she calls by their full name. 

</p><p>Still, the mention of Sudou’s name is consistent with the conversation from just now. 

</p><p>“A girl from the same year asked me about a lot of weird things.” 

</p><p>I remember how confused Sudou looked as he said that. 

</p><p>I guess that person must be Morishita from A Class. 

</p><p>She really is cute at a glance, but it’s understandable that Sudou denied any romantic involvement. 

</p><p>I can clearly sense something strange in her eyes. 

</p><p>“I’d like to know more about your class during the winter break.” 

</p><p>Saying it in a different way, she wants to do reconnaissance on her rival class, right? 

</p><p>She isn’t even trying to hide it, so it’s hard to believe that this is an instruction from Sakayanagi. 

</p><p>She would send someone else if she were to approach Sudou, so there would be no merit in going out of her way to send Morishita, who seems like a bit of an oddball to me.

</p><p>Or is her goal to send someone like her, someone who has a couple quirks? 

</p><p>I thought about this and that, but the conclusion I came to was different. 

</p><p>Morishita’s monologue was an independent thought.

</p><p>That’s the closest I can come to a conclusion at this point. 

</p><p>“Kouenji Rokusuke also asked me the same thing, so I’ll let you know that this is all by my own decision.” 

</p><p>Morishita then immediately added that this was all by her own decision.

</p><p>“I see. I thought the students in A Class only acted by Sakayanagi’s instructions.” 

</p><p>For now, I’m going to believe Morishita and move the conversation forward. 

</p><p>“I don’t understand that. I don’t think the same way as the other people.” 

</p><p>Morishita continued while speaking in a roundabout way.

</p><p>“Many of us in A Class are wary of your class, which has vigilantly improved its ranking. So I ended up becoming interested in B Class.” 

</p><p>“B Class has increased its reputation by a lot. You should contact the leader Horikita if you want to find out more, I can give you her contact information if you want.” 

</p><p>I took out my phone and put up Horikita’s address.

</p><p>Morishita rejected it with her hand, however, and started talking. 

</p><p>“I wanted to do that at first, but the people around me changed their minds. Now, some people think that you’re the one that has something to do with the B Class’ improvement.” 

</p><p>So that’s why she acted alone and contacted me. 

</p><p>“Students who diverge from their OAA stats are much more noticeable.”

</p><p>The fact that the results of the special test at the end of the second term were made public is significant. 

</p><p>Sanada, this Morishita, and other highly capable students have been noticing it lately. 

</p><p>It’s obvious that the discrepancies between my results and my OAA are too large to ignore. 

</p><p>They wouldn’t believe me even if I told them that I got the questions correct by giving random answers. 

</p><p>This contact feels too sloppy, or too aimless to be instructed by Sakayanagi. 

</p><p>“So? Do you think you can get results by directly coming to me? Are there any questions I should answer?” 

</p><p>I showed her that I welcomed questions, but she rejected with her hand. 

</p><p>“I did get some results. It looks like you are going to be some threat to us after all, Ayanokoji Kiyotaka.” 

</p><p>“...Did I do anything to make you think that way?”

</p><p>“From my analysis, yes.” 

</p><p>Morishita nodded her head as if she was just convinced of something at this time.

</p><p>My first impression of her was that she was an ‘eccentric person’.

</p><p>“You’ll have to excuse me. There’s still a lot of people I need to look into.” 

</p><p>It looks like there’s a lot of people she’s curious about in Horikita Class. 

</p><p>“I see. Good luck.” 

</p><p>I guess this is how she talked to Sudou and Yousuke too.

</p><p>I wasn’t there when it happened, but I can picture the scene very easily.

</p><p>Morishita went back to the dormitory, but I didn’t want to follow her and give her the wrong impression.

</p><p>I decided to take a breath of cold air for a while and then return home.
