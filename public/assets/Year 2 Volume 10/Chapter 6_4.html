It’s strange, though. Year-1 and Year-3 students are free to secure any table they want for today, but it looks like the ones that are regularly used by Year-2 students are being ignored.” </p><p>It’s not as if there are set areas in the cafeteria divided by year. </p><p>The students just ended up drawing the lines themselves, and most students follow it as an unspoken rule.</p><p>There are students who don’t care about that, of course. </p><p>“You don’t seem to mind the details, Horikita.” </p><p>“Aren’t you the same way?”</p><p>“In my case, I’m the type who wants to read the room and go along with the majority.”</p><p>“You don’t seem that way, but you also do… Let’s just stop thinking about that for now. I don’t have the leeway to spend my thinking power on you.”</p><p>It was a slightly cutting remark, but I also prefer it if she doesn’t think about me.</p><p>“Greetings, Class-B students. Shall we eat together?”</p><p>I heard a voice while splitting my chopsticks.</p><p>“You’re free to sit wherever you want, Sakayanagi-san. I have no right to deny you.”</p><p>She did not say no, but I’m sure she’s still surprised.</p><p>I doubt she expected the leader of an opponent class to speak to her during a Special Test..</p><p>“I don’t mind eating together either, but where’s your food?” </p><p>Sakayanagi is empty-handed. It would take time for her to go and purchase her meal now.</p><p>“Masumi-san and Kitou-kun are buying it for me right now. They will arrive very soon.”</p><p>I looked where her eyes were pointed at, and indeed saw Masumi and Kitou sluggishly waiting in line.</p><p>“What nice friends, huh?”</p><p>“Yes. They are very helpful.”</p><p>Sakayanagi sat down facing Horikita and leaned her cane against the table as Kitou brought her cutleries and tray one by one with one hand. </p><p>From this, one can see that he is used to constantly supporting Sakayanagi. </p><p>“Now, please sit down too, you two.” </p><p>“Huh? Here? We’re going to eat with Horikita and Ayanokoji? I don’t really like that.”</p><p>“It’s fine. This might come in handy for your future, Masumi-san.”</p><p>“Are you trying to wrap me up in some trouble again? I’m tired of playing your games.” </p><p>Kamuro’s name is among the eliminations in Class-A, but she doesn’t seem distressed.</p><p>While showing some backlash towards Sakayanagi, this attitude is only because she believes Sakayanagi would never finish in last place. </p><p>It must be reassuring to know that they are in 1st place.</p><p>I raised my hand to lightly greet Kitou.</p><p>Kitou didn’t show much of a reaction, but he faintly nodded back, which is enough.</p><p>“Please go easy on me in the second half, Horikita-san.” </p><p>“Now you’re saying that? I believe you attacked us quite harshly during the first half.”</p><p>“I was only playing around. Don’t you think the fact that you’re able to be in 2nd place is proof of that?”</p><p>“So impudent…”</p><p>Horikita got a little annoyed when Sakayanagi implied she went easy on her.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, one more man appeared from behind Horikita.</p><p>“Can I join in?”</p><p>Kitou quickly stood up on guard after sensing his presence.</p><p>However, the man ignored this and sat beside Horikita without asking for permission.</p><p>“That was quite the chaotic entrance, Ryuen-kun.”</p><p>“Hehe. It looked like the sheeps were herding together, so the wolf came over to check on them.”</p><p>He looks very comfortable for the only leader who was behind in the first half.</p><p>Still, there is no way he would let his exhaustion be seen here anyhow.</p><p>“Get lost.”</p><p>The quiet, but heavy remark came from Kitou.</p><p>“Huh? Like you have any damn right to give me orders. The tiny girl over there isn’t saying anything, y’know.”</p><p>“Give me permission. I’ll get rid of him right now.”</p><p>Kitou asked Sakayanagi while readying himself to approach Ryuen.</p><p>The insult to Sakayanagi must be part of why he’s transitioning to a fighting stance.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Kitou-kun. He’s just here because he’s hungry. We have to welcome this pathetic, weak wolf.”</p><p>“He doesn’t have anything with him, though? Are you making Ishizaki get your food for you?”</p><p>“He isn’t here looking for food, he’s looking for points in this Special Test, as he’s fallen quite behind during the first half.” </p><p>“Yeah, I guess that’s true.”</p><p>3 classes are in a close battle, but the Ryuen Class alone is currently far behind.</p><p>She hinted at that fact with her words, but Ryuen didn’t seem to be bothered.</p><p>Confirming that Ryuen will not do anything suspicious, Kitou quietly sat back down.</p><p>“Still, Kamuro. You seem very comfortable, despite the possibility that you might be going away today.” </p><p>Kamuro halted with the fried horse mackerel between her chopsticks and glared back.</p><p>“Same for you, Kitou. You’re going to be eliminated too if you get your next problem wrong.”</p><p>Sakayanagi quickly answered Ryuen after his remark.</p><p>“My class is currently in 1st place. Conversely, yours is in last place. Are you really one to talk like that?”</p><p>“Even if I get last place, all I’m going to be losing are some common soldiers. But Kamuro and Yamamura are expulsion candidates for you right now. That makes 4 people when Kitou and Hashimoto mess up. Currently, you’re the one who will suffer a serious blow if you lose someone. Or are you going to let Horikita hurt you in the second half and increase your eliminations to find some trash you can throw away?” </p><p>Sakayanagi won’t say that there will be more eliminations from now on. </p><p>That’s fundamentally not something she would desire.</p><p>“Are you trying to eliminate the people close to me?” </p><p>“Do you really still need me to explain that?”</p><p>“It is a little hard to believe. I would have to admit that I failed while targeting the students in your class to get them in reach of elimination. You can see the result of you going after Masumi-san and Kitou-kun to shake me up for yourself.” </p><p>I have the impression that Ryuen’s strategy is to target the 8 students who are the most valuable for Sakayanagi, centering on Kitou, Kamuro, and Hashimoto.</p><p>While this made his attacks inefficient, Sakayanagi still wasn’t able to protect Kamuro and Yamamura.</p><p>She doesn’t have to protect them, even if she knows his objective. </p><p>In fact, Sakayanagi’s ratio of successful protections was highest out of the 4 classes during the first half.</p><p>“We’re keeping 1st place thanks to your childish strategy. So, while I am grateful, I also worry for you, Ryuen-kun. You’re just going to repeat the same failure unless you change your strategy for the second half. Even looking at it from an indirect point of view, you can see it too, can’t you Horikita-san?”</p><p>“It is true that his objective was too easy to guess. I would have targeted a larger number of students when I noticed that you have a tendency to protect them.”</p><p>I didn’t expect them to start scrutinizing the Special Test here, but Ryuen kept listening while laughing. </p><p>“I definitely recommend you to choose a wiser fighting strategy.” </p><p>However, instead of backing down, Ryuen put his elbows on the table and took on the challenge.</p><p>“I still know a lot about you, Sakayanagi. We can just shelve the score difference for a moment. Kamuro, if by some chance this ends with 2 eliminations and your class in last place, do you know the decision this girl would make?” </p><p>Kamuro stopped her hands, and while she did not speak, this did seem to cause some worry in her. </p><p>What will her leader do if it comes to a decision between two people?</p><p>This is relatable for Horikita too. </p><p>I’m sure she’s interested in what standard Sakayanagi would use to decide the expulsion by.</p><p>However, Sakayanagi simply continued eating.</p><p>“You can’t answer? No, you don’t want to answer? What do you think, Horikita?”</p><p>“That doesn’t matter, but why did you target Yamamura-san in the first place? It looks like you narrowed your targets down to a few people, but she doesn’t seem like someone to be targeting so relentlessly.” </p><p>Kamuro is here with us, but not Yamamura. </p><p>Considering this also, it’s only natural to think that Kamuro is more special.</p><p>The other students who were targeted were all outstandingly talented.</p><p>However, there is an unseen connection between Sakayanagi and Yamamura. </p><p>Yamamura has abilities that cannot be seen on the OAA.</p><p>“You probably don’t know, but remember this. Yamamura is just as valuable for Sakayanagi as Kamuro is. I’m sure she takes real good care of her behind the scenes, right?”</p><p>He made this known by forcibly turning the topic back to Yamamura.</p><p>Sakayanagi stopped eating for the first time here.</p><p>“You’re free to think so.” </p><p>Sakayanagi earnestly replied that she doesn’t care what Ryuen thinks. </p><p>“No matter what the truth is, a third party who doesn’t know anything can’t assign value to individuals. Both Kamuro-san and Yamamura-san are just excellent classmates for Sakayanagi-san.” </p><p>Even if she’s wrong, I suppose Horikita doesn’t want to become a factor in making Sakayanagi change her thinking.</p><p>“Both excellent classmates? Hah, don’t make me laugh. Sakayanagi doesn’t value people based on their OAA. Her standards are based on whether someone is easy to use and obedient.”</p><p>“In the background, yes.”</p><p>Kamuro looked over at Sakayanagi and quietly gave her confirmation.</p><p>“It looks like Kamuro didn’t expect Yamamura’s name to come up here.”</p><p>I’m sure Ryuen doesn’t know everything about the inner workings of Class-A either.</p><p>The recognition of Kamuro and Yamamura, and their relation is irrelevant. He is simply harassing Sakayanagi here.</p><p>This must still be an irritating obstruction, however.</p><p>“Were you close with Yamamura?”</p><p>“He’s just trying to stir things up.”</p><p>“I’m just asking because I had no idea you and Yamamura had common ground.”</p><p>It was a short time for Kamuro, but anyone would have noticed this.</p><p>“Like I said, he’s just trying to stir things up. It’s a waste of time to take him seriously.”</p><p>She’s not trying to avoid an undesirable subject, but instead really believes that would be a waste of time.</p><p>Although she formally tried to stop it, it is clear that Sakayanagi is enjoying Kamuro’s sensitive reaction to Ryuen’s words, which shows her leeway as the power holder.</p><p>“You’re going to think about which one to expel now, aren’t you?” </p><p>It seems the reason for Ryuen’s appearance here was not just to provoke Sakayanagi.</p><p>His purpose is to potentially imprint the idea of not having any more eliminations from Class-A, and to potentially drop additional mainstays like Kitou or Hashimoto to expel them.</p><p>“I expect that you are not the kind of person to be swayed by the words of someone like him.”</p><p>Sakayanagi made this remark in order to stop that. </p><p>“I know.”</p><p>However, Horikita is fighting to win.</p><p>She isn’t taking on the test with the objective of expelling someone from the Sakayanagi Class.</p><p>It’s a different story if that happens to be an effective strategy in order to win, but…Perhaps deciding that there is no point in further continuing these simple provocations, Ryuen changed the subjects to another class.</p><p>“By the way, is Ichinose the only one who didn’t come here?”</p><p>“It looks like her class is sticking to a policy of not allowing anyone to be eliminated, and I don’t see anyone from her class in the cafeteria either. I think it’s only natural.”</p><p>Indeed, there are no students from the Ichinose Class in the cafeteria. </p><p>I didn’t see any of them on the way either except for the ones doing the minimum necessities like going to the toilet.</p><p>They’ve prepared their meals in advance and are carefully utilizing every minute and second.</p><p>“It looks like she’s ready to lose in order not to let anyone from her class get expelled. That girl is a complete idiot.”</p><p>I’m sure Ichinose really does care a lot about eliminations, even from the other classes. </p><p>However, she can’t avoid her own class being damaged if she loses in this fight. </p><p>As such, she has to become the bad person and cause eliminations from other classes and earn points. </p><p>“Yeah. She never wavers in any Special Test. That’s precisely why I was able to find gaps in her defense and push her down to 3rd place.”</p><p>Horikita also stopped eating and talked about her own first half of the battle.</p><p>“Ichinose’s personality is a sickness when it goes that far. She will have to use up all her protection slots to the limit if she continues with the same strategy in the second half. That’s an advantage for you, isn’t it, Ryuen?” </p><p>He can simply attack the Ichinose Class like Horikita. </p><p>He has a good chance of breaking through all of her protection slots, provided the number of students in reach of elimination isn’t increased above 6. </p><p>Even if it doesn’t give him points, he can’t ignore a method of pushing down those above him in order to raise his ranking.</p><p>“I’m the one who will attack your class next, though. Even if your protection efficiency increases because of more eliminations, I’m sure I can take a few points anyway.” </p><p>Like with Koenji, Sakayanagi thinks ahead and guesses what her opponent's leader will do. </p><p>Depending on how she uses protection slots because of Ryuen, she could lose out on points she would have scored otherwise.</p><p>She will especially have a hard time while trying to protect the students who can't be reliably expected to answer correctly.</p><p>“I’ll look forward to it.”</p><p>Ryuen violently stood up.</p><p>“Now that the person causing the disturbance left us, let’s get back to eating our meals.”</p><p>Ryuen quietly tousled his hair while walking away from Sakayanagi.</p><img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 10/Images/image4.webp" alt=""><p>Contrary to the thoughts of those around him at that moment, he had a strong willed expression on his face, foreshadowing that he was going to do something in the second half of the battle.</p><p>I’m sure it’s not a coincidence that he let only me see that expression for just a moment.</p><p>A threatening message, telling me to just shut up and watch. </p><p>Let’s see how he will try to turn things around while seemingly desperate to fight back despite his inferiority.</p><p>The second half will begin very soon.</p><p></p></div>
