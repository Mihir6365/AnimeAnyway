    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <h2>The Monologue of Masayoshi Hashimoto</h2>
    <p>
        To put it simply, I don’t trust people.
    </p>
    <p>I have an extremely strong dislike of blindly trusting someone with all my heart.

    </p>
    <p>I never truly trust anyone.

    </p>
    <p>Isn't that right, after all?

    </p>
    <p>People can easily betray.

    </p>
    <p>They plead for your trust, saying ‘It's all okay’, only to betray you.

    </p>
    <p>The more you believe in them, the greater the shock you feel when they betray you.

    </p>
    <p>Since that’s the case, Isn't it better to betray first before getting betrayed?

    </p>
    <p>It's more advantageous to live dishonestly and gain than to live honestly and struggle.

    </p>
    <p>This is my ——— “Hashimoto Masayoshi” ’s absolute policy.

    </p>

    <p><label style="cursor: pointer; color: blue;" for="toggle2">Justice……
            Justice, huh…</label>
    </p>
    <input type="checkbox" id="toggle2" style="display: none;">
    <p class="note2" id="example-note2">
        TL Note 1 - Hashimoto’s given name - ‘Masayoshi’ can be written using different kanji characters and it
        means -
        ‘Justice’.
    </p>

    <!-- <label for="toggle">Click on the word <span style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">example</span> for a note about it.</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="toggle" style="display: none;">
    <div class="note" id="example-note">
        This is an example note about the word "example".
    </div> -->

    <p>
        Every time I say that, I feel disgust for my own name.
    </p>

    <p>That feeling… it doesn't seem to be uncommon these days.

    </p>
    <p>Compared to the people who genuinely hate their own names, my hatred is, well, pretty cute.

    </p>
    <p>I just hate it because of the mismatch between my own thoughts and the name.

    </p>
    <p>My name Masayoshi and ‘Justice’ are completely unrelated.

    </p>
    <p>I understand it logically.

    </p>
    <p>Even so, when people see my name, they tend to associate my personality with something different at first.

    </p>
    <p>They judge what's in a person by his or her name.

    </p>
    <p>Sorry, but I won't become a Supporter of justice anymore.

    </p>
    <p>From the moment I entered this school, I had already made up my mind.

    </p>
    <p>I'll definitely graduate from ‘Class A’ and will get back at those who betrayed me.

    </p>
    <p>I'll do whatever it takes, no matter how awful, to make that happen.

    </p>
    <p>I'll bring anyone down.

    </p>
    <p>I’ll make anyone resent me.

    </p>
    <p>Even if it's Ryuen or Sakayanagi, and yes, even Ayanokoji.

    </p>
    <p>I won't change no matter who the opponent is.

    </p>
    <p>I act for my sake and for mine alone.
    </p>
    <p></p>
