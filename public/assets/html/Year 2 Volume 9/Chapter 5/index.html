        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c21 c33"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days after the matter with Kanzaki and the others and the Student Council
                        came
                        to an end.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The year-two students had been studying day after day for the upcoming Special
                        Test.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, the students with lower academic ability were given heavier
                        responsibilities, and it&rsquo;s certain that this has produced a big change from the previous
                        written
                        tests.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the students went to the cafeteria as soon as lunch break started, but
                        more
                        than half of the students remained in the class and took out their lunch boxes or something from
                        a
                        convenience store.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, a strange scene with tablets, books, notebooks and such on the table
                        is
                        all around.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uuuh&hellip; So sleepy. I wanna sleep&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard such a voice from a certain student.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wanna hang out, I wanna hang out, I wanna hang out, I wanna hang
                        out&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another voice from a different student.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the corridor too loud? It&rsquo;s ruining my focus~ Someone
                        quiet
                        them down~&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some are even worrying about the outside noises.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">More and more dissatisfied students are starting to talk about what they&rsquo;d
                        like
                        to do instead of this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that many of the students were not getting enough sleep, and Sonoda was
                        also
                        one of them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too sleepy~&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He held his head in his hands and shook it, desperately trying to get rid of his
                        drowsiness.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just work a little more. We&rsquo;ll take a break after we
                        finish
                        here, so&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mii-chan, guiding the study next to Sonoda, gave the others a soft talk of
                        encouragement.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You finished your work earlier already, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I feel suddenly motivated, or rather I&rsquo;m going with the flow. I
                        think
                        I&rsquo;m doing well.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The couple combination of Ike and Shinohara studying together side by
                        side.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shinohara seems to be doing a lot better than usual.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been attending the study sessions every day for the past few
                        days,
                        right? I feel like I&rsquo;m being made to pay for all the time I&rsquo;ve been slacking off,
                        but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shinohara repeatedly yawned sleepily, but she seemed positive.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;ve learned some things.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not me, not at all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just keep at it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So reliable. Now that&rsquo;s my girlfriend!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Ike hugged Shinohara after shouting so, a textbook was smashed into the top
                        of
                        his head.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After we&rsquo;re all done.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uuuh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t keep doing stupid things over and over again. Come on,
                        focus on
                        the problems.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very motivated, huh, Shinohara-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing her up close, Yousuke called out to Shinohara.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been nothing but a burden, but this Special Test is the best
                        chance
                        for me to make up for that, right? I have to contribute to the class a little, and I don&rsquo;t
                        want to get
                        expelled.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reality is that if one does not improve their abilities, they will fall down
                        in
                        the rankings necessary for the class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that this will come back to haunt one in the event of an emergency is
                        already proven by a previous case.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem to be working hard too, Ike-kun. Don&rsquo;t force yourself,
                        though.
                        There&rsquo;s no point if you collapse before the real thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;R-right.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yousuke praised him, and advised him to be more careful.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such was their conversation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s obvious, but students who are not motivated don&rsquo;t want to waste
                        their time studying. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it is necessary to be able to put in the effort. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
                        if
                        it&rsquo;s for your boyfriend or girlfriend.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One has to find a reason that suits them. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the shortcut to effort. Just like how Sudou&rsquo;s driving force was
                        Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were a lot of students who had a hard time studying, but the whole class
                        was
                        able to come together in this way.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still, the corridor is so noisy.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The students want to concentrate on their studies, but there are many people
                        passing
                        by in the corridor, or people talking and running around. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a time when you need to concentrate, this noise is like an uninvited
                        guest.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a look. There&rsquo;s a lot of students here who
                        are
                        being bothered, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if I can&rsquo;t stop the disturbance, I can at least find out what caused
                        it.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we know what&rsquo;s going on, it will have a stabilizing effect on the
                        restless
                        students.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be best for me to go check the corridor, so that the students
                        aren&rsquo;t
                        disturbed while studying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.3o7alnk"><span class="c20">Part 1</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I stepped into the corridor, students from Ichinose class were running with
                        angry expressions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Further, students from Ryuuen class were also heading in the same
                        direction.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As such, I quickly discovered the source of the noise. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A crowd of people in front of a certain classroom. Ishizaki and Albert were
                        trying to
                        kick it open.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on out, Ichinose! Ryuuen-san is here!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishizaki shouted so to Ichinose inside the classroom, but Shibata, who was
                        already in
                        the hallway, stopped him.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell are you doing? We&rsquo;re busy right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Busy? I don&rsquo;t care. Make Ichinose come out here
                        already.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He tried to pull Shibata away from the entrance, but Shibata resisted. The one
                        instructing Ishizaki is Ryuuen, smiling behind him.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it wouldn&rsquo;t be good to openly beat him up. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s lunchtime with many people coming and going, and there are numerous
                        surveillance cameras in the corridor, so the school will soon get wind of any problematic
                        behaviour.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The students who saw Ryuuen and the others&rsquo; conduct are probably sheltering
                        Ichinose inside the class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought the situation would stay the same for a while, but it quickly
                        changed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The classroom&rsquo;s door opened, and Ichinose showed herself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was accompanied by a few other girls at the same time, who seemed to be
                        trying to
                        stop her. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Further, Kanzaki, Hamaguchi and other chief students also showed up.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, look at this. There she is. The stupid leader who quit the Student
                        Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen raised his voice with his usual attitude. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The new Student Council system was just revealed today. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the fact that Ichinose resigned was not a surprise in itself, since everyone
                        ended
                        up knowing about it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Publicly, the reason for Ichinose&rsquo;s resignation was to concentrate on her
                        studies, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter to Ryuuen whether this is true or not.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought it would be a good idea to use this as a weakness, so he quickly came
                        to
                        shake her up. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that he intentionally went for this timing. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He decided it would be more effective with other people around. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, there were many students from other classes who heard the commotion and
                        came
                        to see what was going on.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hashimoto from A Class, whose gaze clearly met mine, quickly blended in with
                        other
                        students.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so loud here, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. She got into the Student Council early on and benefited from
                        it.
                        It&#39;s natural for the crowd to want to know why she can&#39;t even maintain that,
                        right?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm&rdquo;.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen spoke to Ishizaki, who replied while crossing his arms.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She said she will just concentrate on her schoolwork,
                        though..&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a slightly troubled expression on her face, Ichinose reiterated the reason
                        she
                        left the Student Council. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, like I said before, Ryuuen won&rsquo;t care about any answer
                        she
                        will give.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were really kicked out, right? They must have told you that
                        you&rsquo;re
                        too incompetent to serve in the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it seems like that, then maybe it is.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose, realizing that it&rsquo;s pointless to try and reply seriously, went
                        along
                        with Ryuuen&rsquo;s words.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh. Rather, are your past sins being called into question now? It would
                        be
                        bad for the Student Council President to be a cunning little shoplifter. I understand why you
                        wanted to run
                        away.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The verbal pressure from Ryuuen, who had no intention to settle this with an
                        agreement, continued. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose may have some thoughts about the word shoplifter, but this subject
                        isn&rsquo;t anything new for Ichinose these days.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I say, but it&rsquo;s not good to
                        trouble people like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t it. Everyone wants to know, right? The real reason you
                        quit
                        the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He keeps trying to provoke her to confess.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not able to quietly sit idly as a fellow student, Kanzaki interrupted the
                        two.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Ryuuen. The Student Council itself also notified us
                        of
                        the reason she resigned.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about their lies. It&rsquo;s obviously suspicious to
                        quit
                        at a time like this. If she loses in the next Special Test to me, she&rsquo;ll finally be
                        falling off a
                        cliff.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen uttered so, not even thinking about the possibility he might lose to
                        her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ichinose Class is on a downward trend right now, and they have no impetus to
                        rise
                        up.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the point difference between them and A Class is doubled, they will be in an
                        even
                        more hopeless situation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The students in Ichinose Class should be noticing this dangerous reality too by
                        now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It must be annoying to take all these tests, I recommend your class just
                        withdraw.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you stop joking around now? We have no intention of giving up on A
                        Class,
                        and we&rsquo;re making every effort to win the next Special Test.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Effort, huh? Indeed, your good point is that you guys are stupidly
                        serious. I
                        understand why you still have some hope in a Special Test like this, where you can win if you
                        simply match
                        your textbooks in the test.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ichinose Class will never withdraw because of something like this, even if
                        they
                        are further shaken up.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From what Kanzaki and the others are saying, numerous sabotage efforts against
                        their
                        studies have already begun. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose has remained silent since Kanzaki&rsquo;s interruption.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought maybe she had nothing to say back, but her expression wasn&rsquo;t
                        clouded
                        in the least.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ryuuen-kun. Are you done now?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With an unchanging attitude, Ichinose showed a smile while soothing the tense
                        Kanzaki.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re free to say whatever you want to me, but I want you to stop
                        hindering the students who are trying their best. Not to mention the people going to eat lunch
                        now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She warned Ryuuen and the others who were blocking the corridor.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this a simple bluff? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a fine line, but the corners of Ryuuen&rsquo;s mouth turned up slightly,
                        as if
                        he had decided that he had been effective in increasing the interest and suspicion of those
                        around him about
                        Ichinose leaving the Student Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re hindering them, and I&rsquo;m hungry too.
                        Let&rsquo;s pull out.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It lasted only a few minutes, but it&rsquo;s normal that things got loud after
                        Ryuuen
                        showed up. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even a bad reputation is useful. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone among year-two knows how strong Ryuuen is.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Ryuuen no longer there, most of the students quickly dispersed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hashimoto&rsquo;s figure was gone too, and things became calm again. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, students in the Horikita class should also be able to eat their
                        lunches
                        and study.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah. Ayanokoji-kun!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noticing me after the crowd left, Ichinose approached me with a smile.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, all that noise was because of me, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. It was just Ryuuen who caused the commotion.
                        Are
                        you okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. It was actually a rather good thing for us.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That blatant provocation?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ryuuen will keep trying to hinder us until the Special Test starts. For
                        us,
                        that&rsquo;s more of an advantage than a disadvantage.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She doesn&rsquo;t mind her studies being disturbed. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, it looks like she wants them to be disturbed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ichinose, it&rsquo;s about time to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While looking at the situation, Kanzaki approached with a look that said he
                        didn&rsquo;t want to talk for long.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re discussing the Special Test and studying for it
                        during
                        this lunch break, just like the Horikita Class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could see that leeway in Kanzaki&rsquo;s expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you later, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying so, Ichinose calmly returned to her classroom.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...See me later?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a little curious about those words, but first, I should return to the
                        classroom
                        to explain the situation to Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After witnessing the commotion, Hashimoto quickly left the corridor and headed
                        for
                        the school cafeteria. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he joined a group of 3 who had already arrived and were having their
                        lunch.</span></p>

                        don&rsquo;t think

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi put down the chopsticks in her hands and turned her gaze towards

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know they used to be D Class, but they&rsquo;re up to B Class now. The

                        the gap
                        will be less than 200 points. Things can turn around after one big Special Test.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi doesn&rsquo;t seem to care, but Kanzaki sitting in front of her is

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I saw an example. Ryuuen is using new methods to corner the Ichinose

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;New methods? It doesn&rsquo;t seem like that to me. He&#39;s still doing

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hashimoto expressed his true feelings with some criticism towards Sakayanagi
                        mixed
                        in.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Facing these true feelings, Sakayanagi replied with a smile without any feelings
                        of
                        displeasure.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In a written Special Test like this, we are extremely limited in what we
                        can
                        do. There is very little we can do externally, all we can do is sit at our desks, stare at our
                        textbooks and
                        face ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know that, but it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s nothing we can

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are a lot of students in our class who are not bothered by studying,
                        who
                        work on their own initiative or in their own teams. I don&rsquo;t think there is anything I have
                        to tell
                        them, do you? Trying to cram more than you can handle is counterproductive.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hashimoto bit his lip a little and replied with an attitude of
                        disagreement.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;re dissatisfied with doing nothing. Should we observe
                        everyone 24/7 and exert pressure on them like Ryuuen-kun and hinder our opponents too? &nbsp;I
                        don&rsquo;t
                        think that would be efficient.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It may not be efficient, yes, and I know that the probability of you
                        adopting
                        this tactic is low, considering that it would be a rehash of Ryuuen&rsquo;s. Isn&rsquo;t it much
                        better than
                        doing nothing, though? It&rsquo;s annoying to be disturbed while studying when you need to
                        focus.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hashimoto expressed that imitating Ryueen&rsquo;s strategy is also one of the

                        they have.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It may make some sense on the surface, but even Ichinose would just shut
                        herself in the dormitory if she is bothered by the interference, right? Is there a point in
                        forcing her to
                        change the location she is studying in?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kamuro asked so with half-curiosity as she tore off a piece of bread.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is true that you can&rsquo;t always achieve your full potential by
                        studying
                        in your room the whole time. Especially for those who are not accustomed to studying, it is
                        easier to learn
                        in a place where there is contact with the outside world.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why Ichinose and the others continue to study in places

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The most crucial point?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It takes a lot of manpower to conduct an act of sabotage. Further, a
                        middling
                        sabotage won&rsquo;t make a good public impression. Can you really consider it harmless if our
                        reputation as
                        A Class worsens after having to interfere with our opponent&#39;s studies in order to
                        win?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, that would be far from how the A Class, the champion, would conduct
                        themselves.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, we&rsquo;ll lose a lot of learning time with that strategy. We
                        won&rsquo;t be able to reduce the other class&rsquo; score to zero, and we&rsquo;ll also
                        decrease the score
                        we can get. We could hire a year-one or year-three and ask them to interfere, but there&rsquo;s
                        no proof
                        they&rsquo;ll do a job worth the price, and we&rsquo;ll need people to monitor their work.
                        It&rsquo;s not
                        going to be that big of a big class point fluctuation this time, so it would be
                        inefficient.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Continuously refused, Hashimoto kept thinking about what they could do.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, it&rsquo;s okay if I move personally, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it. His approach is a strategy that is
                        perfectly
                        suited for the expression &lsquo;putting the cart before the horse&rsquo;..&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&#39;s continuing his ignorant efforts of sabotage and reducing the number of
                        people and time available for studying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s the same for one person or ten people. If your harassment
                        of
                        the other class becomes known, it is not only your fault, but it degrades the A Class too. Am I
                        wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">How many people will believe Hashimoto when he claims that he was doing things by
                        himself? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s effective, then people will think Sakayanagi was the one giving the
                        order behind the scenes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying that Ryuuen is engaged in a useless strategy
                        too?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not exactly. Even if it&rsquo;s a useless strategy for us, it&rsquo;s very
                        significant for Ryuuen&rsquo;s class to adopt a strategy of sabotage, unlike us. They are one of
                        the few
                        classes in year-two that have a low motivation to learn and very few people who have good
                        studying skills.
                        Even if they were to study hard at their desks, they would not be able to match the academic
                        ability of
                        Ichinose-san&rsquo;s class. That&rsquo;s precisely why they&rsquo;re trying to make their
                        opponent fall
                        down, instead of making themselves grow.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi logically explained so to Hashimoto who was insisting that something
                        should be done.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying we can win like this, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If things go in order, we will win this Special Test. However, with the
                        Special Test&rsquo;s rules, the initiative is on the opponent&rsquo;s side. Lower ranked classes
                        can fight
                        against higher ranked classes in this Special Test, but the lower ranked classes can get the
                        most points.
                        With this kind of battle, there is no definitive proof of how things will go.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the Sakayanagi Class gets a perfect score, it cannot match a perfect
                        score
                        from Horikita&rsquo;s class under the current rules.</span></p>

                        for
                        elimination. In that sense, Ryuuen-kun&rsquo;s strategy is a foolish one for not taking that
                        into
                        account.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I get what you&rsquo;re saying. But&hellip; I&rsquo;m wary of B Class.

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hashimoto did not say any more, but the first name on the list must be Ayanokoji

                        however will be a showdown with Ryuuen. The fluctuation in class points will be greater than
                        ever, so we can
                        make sure not to lose then, right?&rdquo;</span></p>

                        never lose.
                        Of course, I&rsquo;m sure Ryuuen-kun would give the same reply as well.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s different in the world of mangas, novels or TV series,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, are you saying Sakayanagi can lose?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a failure as a story for the A Class to run solo like this. It
                        would be more exciting for it to be defeated in the final tests. A 3-way struggle with the
                        Ryuuen and
                        Horikita class in year-three. Finally, one of them would beat the others and win the seat of
                        Class A in the
                        ending&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the students in A Class, a scenario like that is hard to believe.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, you really are an Idealist.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Horikita and Ryuuen. We have to accept that one of them may cause a
                        turn-around somehow.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very like you to think that way, Hashimoto.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, Hashimoto is in a position to have a certain grasp on the
                        information
                        about A Class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, I have to be cautious not just of the ones behind us, but also the
                        ones
                        in front of us, and the ones by our sides. I can&rsquo;t just trust you so easily either,
                        Kaneda.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kaneda, ominously laughing after hearing his name, put his finger on the rim of
                        his
                        glasses.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural that you would be suspicious of Ryuuen&rsquo;s
                        puppet.
                        You have to keep being this way. Even I mess up my calculations sometimes.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am for me. You are for you, and we utilize each other. This is the best
                        kind
                        of relationship.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kaneda showed an image from his phone to Hashimoto, and erased all the words from
                        the
                        screen when Hashimoto nodded after burning the text into his eyes. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Kaneda naturally separated from his side.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do I go with Sakayanagi, or do I go with Ryuuen? Even Horikita&rsquo;s
                        class,
                        perhaps. It&rsquo;s about time to decide.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Preparing for the end of this year and the third year ahead of it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hashimoto continued thinking about what he can do for himself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.ihv636"><span class="c20">Part 3</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After school, the day after the opponents Ryuuen and Ichinose had direct contact
                        and
                        some trouble.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was invited to a study meeting by Horikita as usual, but I naturally
                        declined.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei has been continuing to be silent while keeping her eye on me since the
                        morning,
                        and I don&rsquo;t have any real plans after this either.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I can put aside some time to solve a troublesome problem.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word &ldquo;shoplifter&rdquo; has been flying all around recently, but
                        there&rsquo;s a matter that can be called the origin of this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is Kiryuuin Fuuka being framed as a shoplifter? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From seeing her words and conduct, I can see why she said she doesn&rsquo;t even
                        have
                        one friend.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, I&rsquo;m sure some people from all of the year-threes and not just
                        her
                        own class do hate her. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, one normally would not reach the idea of framing her for a crime just
                        for
                        this reason.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it was during year-one when Kiryuuin had been recognized as an obstacle in the
                        fight with A Class, it may have been considered a strategy without regard to right or wrong, but
                        now that
                        the match is determined, is there a point in going to the trouble of taking such a risk?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The highest possibility in the current situation is that this is an indirect form
                        of
                        harassment towards her by Nagumo. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A strategy by Nagumo to harass Kiryuuin into taking the contest seriously.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, from how she broke into the Student Council meeting the other day, I
                        can&rsquo;t say that this is definitely the case. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would have been a good time to reveal what he had done and tell her to take
                        the
                        contest seriously.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That must be precisely why Kiryuuin is having trouble coming to a definitive
                        conclusion.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a few choices I can take while moving with the investigation.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One is to confront Nagumo, the leading candidate. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other is to listen to what Yamanaka, who put the goods into Kiryuuin&rsquo;s
                        bag,
                        has to say. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last one is to ask for information from a reliable year-three. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, the year-threes have limited informational exchange among each other even at
                        the
                        best of times.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only people with contact details would be former Student Council members like
                        Nagumo or Kiriyama.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In which case, I have no choice but to walk around and gather information by
                        foot.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, I have no intention of letting Nagumo make me waste my time.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I need someone who would have the most useful information for me, and who would
                        not
                        have any connections to the people who framed Kiryuuin.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found a year-three student who is acting alone and gathered information.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the information I gathered, I learned that the person I was looking for had
                        gone
                        to the gymnasium, and I immediately headed there. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could not spot her on the way however, and arrived at the gymnasium.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that the club activities had already started, and Sudou from my class
                        was
                        carefully practicing the basics while shouting louder than anyone else.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the club members began gathering in the gymnasium, I decided to withdraw in
                        order
                        to not disturb them. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked the students coming to the gymnasium, but I couldn&rsquo;t gain any new
                        information. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I could not meet her after all, but when I returned to the entrance and
                        checked
                        for her shoes, I saw that she was still inside the school. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had disappeared, but she was still here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s almost 5 p.m., so there aren&rsquo;t many students left in the school
                        other than those participating in club activities.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is a little risk of standing out here, but I decided to head for the area
                        where
                        the year-three classrooms are.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t find her. I looked over all four classes, but she was nowhere to be
                        seen.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may be wiser to stay at the entrance and wait quietly here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was beginning to think so, I happened to hear that the missing person had
                        gone
                        to the staff room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I arrived at the staff room, and saw the person I was looking for was talking
                        with a
                        teacher from the corridor.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are many teachers coming and going after school, so I decided to wait some
                        distance away so as to not get noticed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After about 10 minutes passed, the student finally left the staff room.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She always has a bright expression, but she began walking looking down with a
                        gloomy
                        expression today.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She went by me without noticing me watching over the staff room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hesitating a little after missing my chance to call out to her, I decided
                        to
                        follow her from a distance. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought that I should call out to her as she was putting on her shoes in the
                        entrance.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that person did not head for the entrance immediately, but headed up the
                        stairs towards the rooftop.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we aren&#39;t allowed to go onto the roof, so she must be here to meet
                        someone.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was thinking about that, she stopped for a moment and I heard something like
                        a
                        crying sound. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that this place wasn&rsquo;t meant to meet someone, but to make sure
                        that no
                        one could see her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The school building was strangely quiet. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tried to hold back, but the sound of crying strangely stood out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone who didn&rsquo;t know what was going on came here, they might think
                        that I
                        made her cry. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could have walked away without being noticed, but I had business to conduct
                        here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to speak as quietly as possible, so as to not surprise her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must have been surprised however, as she probably did not think there was
                        anyone
                        near her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;!? H-huh? Ayanokoji-kun!?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was still in shock, but she slowly put her hands on her face and wiped away
                        the

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She held my sleeve to stop me. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t expect that kind of behaviour.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps she was instinctually aware of the risk that I might tell people she was
                        crying if she lets me leave.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few quiet minutes passed until Asahina gathered her composure.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Mhm. I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Asahina embarrassedly muttered after coughing once.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Another apology? It&rsquo;s my fault for surprising you, so.&rdquo;</span>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another issue. I didn&rsquo;t want you to see me like
                        that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want to awkwardly barge into an unrelated subject, so I
                        won&rsquo;t
                        ask why she was crying. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that this had the opposite effect however, and Asahina began telling me
                        the
                        reason she was crying herself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This morning, Suchi&hellip; No, Honoka left the school. Suchi Honoka from
                        C
                        Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;An expulsion at this time of the year? It&rsquo;s not a penalty from a
                        Special
                        Test, right? Did she drop out herself?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There shouldn&rsquo;t be any Special Tests being conducted for the year-threes at
                        this time. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Asahina shook her head to tell me she didn&rsquo;t drop out
                        herself.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Apparently, it&rsquo;s because she committed a serious violation. So
                        it&rsquo;s punishment for breaking the rules. I went and talked to the teachers to learn the
                        details, but
                        they didn&rsquo;t tell me anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s why she was going to the staff room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Asahina from A Class, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if someone from C Class is
                        expelled. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it&rsquo;s obvious that this person was a friend of hers that surpassed
                        class lines.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you try asking the person in question?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honoka was expelled yesterday, so she wasn&rsquo;t in the dorm this
                        morning. I
                        couldn&rsquo;t get in touch with her either&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been asking the kids from C
                        Class, but no one
                        knew anything. I don&rsquo;t think people are that interested in some kid that&rsquo;s already
                        left.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either no one knows about the reasoning behind Suchi&rsquo;s expulsion, or
                        they&rsquo;re hiding it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita Manabu&rsquo;s generation, Nagumo&rsquo;s generation, Horikita&rsquo;s
                        generation, or year-ones like Nanase or Amasawa.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I only know about four generations at this school, but it&#39;s obvious that
                        there&#39;ve been a lot of expulsions in Nagumo&#39;s generation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, it is rare for an expulsion to happen that is not related to a Special
                        Test.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that the school is hiding the details may mean this is such a serious
                        violation that it would have a bad effect on the school if it was known. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All I can do is imagine, and I don&rsquo;t know what the violation is.
                        But, I
                        think I know the reason. Students in B Class or below are using any means they can every day to
                        catch up to
                        A Class. I&rsquo;m sure she did something she shouldn&rsquo;t have done.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it Nagumo-senpai who holds all authority in your
                        generation?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re approved by Nagumo, you&rsquo;re in A Class, if not, you&rsquo;re
                        eliminated.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s been for the year-threes, from what I can see.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Asahina&rsquo;s gloomy expression tells me that there&rsquo;s something
                        else
                        at play here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there a different, secret path for rising up to A Class?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I would call it a secret path&hellip; Umm,
                        Ayanokoji-kun, how&rsquo;s your relationship with Miyabi?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our relationship? It&rsquo;s never been good, and that hasn&rsquo;t
                        changed
                        now either.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Students from other years don&rsquo;t know about this,
                        so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, I see. I won&rsquo;t tell anyone about what we talked about
                        here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I said so to make her feel at ease, Asahina began telling me the circumstances
                        of
                        the year-threes. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot she&rsquo;d like to get off her chest after
                        her
                        friend was expelled.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Around this time last year, it was said that victory was certain for A
                        Class
                        after Miyabi became the Student Council President, and hope disappeared from B Class and below.
                        That&rsquo;s
                        precisely why everyone was so happy when he officially vowed that anyone could get into A Class
                        if they were
                        talented enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things aren&rsquo;t that easy, of course. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Students who can transfer classes with class points are very rare in this
                        system.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Asahina interrupted her explanation to sigh, and slightly shook her body.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honoka wanted to do something to try and graduate in A Class with me
                        too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she was expelled before even graduating, not achieving her dream.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did Nagumo-senpai say anything about Suchi-senpai&rsquo;s
                        expulsion?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing. Rather, he didn&rsquo;t even care. He probably only noticed it
                        after
                        being informed by a teacher.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wouldn&rsquo;t care about some small-fry disappearing from the school.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I like that about Nagumo.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like, should we go somewhere else? It&rsquo;s a bit cold
                        here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the adrenaline wore off from her body, she finally started to feel the
                        cold.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike a classroom or the staffroom where there is heating, it feels cold in the
                        corridor.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night is close as well, so the temperature has begun going down.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s a lot I&rsquo;d like to ask her as well, so we decided to move to
                        Keyaki Mall, even if it&rsquo;s a little far away from here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, let&rsquo;s continue our talk. So, dissatisfaction and opposition to
                        Nagumo-senpai is increasing by the day, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. Concretely, I don&rsquo;t know how many people there are. Such
                        information doesn&rsquo;t come up to A Class. I got along well with Honoka, so it&rsquo;s just
                        that she told
                        me a little about it. You don&rsquo;t know about the contract Nagumo made with the year-three
                        students,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought he was using some method to bind the grade together, but I

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying so, Asahina told me about the details of the contract while making sure no
                        one
                        was listening in on us.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time, the contract between Nagumo and the year-threes is being

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, one more thing.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like Miyabi intends on leaving some points and conducting a
                        lottery
                        at the end. I think there&rsquo;ll be two or three tickets, but the students who made the
                        contract will be
                        able to draw them.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So even if one has not contributed, they still have a chance of going to A Class
                        until the end of the year.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A contract that Nagumo approached the lower ranked students when the positioning
                        of
                        his A Class was flawless. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as it&rsquo;s impossible to collect 20,000,000 points individually,
                        private
                        points will be collected from many others and converted into class transfer tickets.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chance of graduating in A Class is almost 0 for the students below B Class,
                        but
                        with redistribution of wealth, this chance increases by a few percent.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing as how some students like Kiriyama have actually gained that right, I can
                        say
                        that this is an effective method. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The 75% taxation is very high, but it&rsquo;s necessary for the proposition of
                        giving
                        a ticket to as many students as possible. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Further, this is also beneficial for Nagumo. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By preventing the others from handling such large amounts of money, he can
                        prevent
                        the seeds of rebellion from sprouting.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So he forced that onto the classes below B Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. Miyabi is the only one who really knows how many people have made the
                        contract. But, I think most of the students have done so. Also, it&rsquo;s different from the
                        contract, but
                        we&rsquo;re also giving him 50% as A class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only those in A Class, who are guaranteed to win, can use their full amount of
                        private points freely each month. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a natural right, but students in lower classes may feel
                        dissatisfied.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo understands this, which is why he is able to adjust and control the
                        situation.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In year-three, A Class has the sole lead. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, even if the tax rate is 50%, this amounts to more than the full 75%
                        collected from the other three classes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo, having so much power that he can even decide the results of Special Tests
                        at
                        will, is like an emperor in control of everything.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just happened to be in the same B Class as Miyabi. Miyabi worked hard to
                        get
                        up to A Class, and created this environment. I know that I should be too grateful to him to say
                        things like
                        this, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seemed a bit hesitant, but she pulled the heavy words up from her
                        throat.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if indirectly, Honoka was expelled because of the environment that
                        Miyabi
                        created. I can&rsquo;t help but cry when I think about that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That must be the reason behind her crying inside the school building.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t think that there is any point of contact between this Suchi and
                        Kiryuuin, but the expression &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; may help me out here too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Asahina-senpai, would you lend me your aid?&rdquo;</span></p>

                        Class?&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamanaka-san? We chat now and then, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re
                        good
                        friends. So I don&rsquo;t think I can help you out, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am rather pleased to hear that they aren&rsquo;t good friends, actually.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would be more troubling if you had answered that you had a deep
                        friendship.
                        It&rsquo;s more important that you objectively tell me about Yamanaka-senpai as a
                        year-three.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took out my phone, and displayed Yamanaka Ikuko&rsquo;s OAA. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s a typical D Class student with below average abilities. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing about her sticks out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does she have a wide social circle?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I&rsquo;m not sure. I think she gets along with the girls from her
                        class,
                        but she&rsquo;s not really the popular type that everyone knows.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t want to rely on Asahina&#39;s opinion alone, but from what I heard, I
                        think I can say that she has nothing to offer other than the abilities shown on the OAA.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep what I&rsquo;m about to say off-record.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interesting. I would say the same thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told Asahina about the matter of Kiryuuin being framed as a shoplifter.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was surprised at first, but she quickly began comprehending the
                        circumstances.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So that&rsquo;s why you wanted to talk to me about the
                        year-threes.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anyone else I could rely on.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of nice to hear. Since I&#39;m with Miyabi a lot, people
                        are
                        usually suspicious of me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, I can understand why one would think she is in collusion with
                        Nagumo.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From your point of view, what do you think about this
                        matter?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t talked much with Kiryuuin in these three
                        years, so
                        I don&rsquo;t know much about her, but I think you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that there wouldn&rsquo;t be anyone with a grudge
                        against
                        her, but it&rsquo;s a different thing to frame her as a shoplifter for revenge. Most
                        importantly, they may
                        get expelled if that was to be revealed, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It also quickly ended in failure after being noticed by Kiryuuin-senpai.
                        If
                        it&rsquo;s reported to the school, it may indeed end in an expulsion.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, this entire affair is baffling from the very start.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, yeah. I think I understand a little.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. It was probably right after she was framed to be a shoplifter. On the
                        way
                        home, I saw Kiryuuin-san stomping on a boy after making him fall down.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She made him fall down and stomped on him?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin is usually elegant, or rather calm. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should be talking directly with Yamanaka, who tried to frame Kiryuuin.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Asahina-senpai contacted her, the message was quickly read by
                        Yamanaka-senpai.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like she&rsquo;s in Keyaki Mall right now. Should I tell her you
                        want
                        to see her?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded, and she sent her the message.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s read it, but there&rsquo;s no reply yet. Wait a
                        bit.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After looking at her phone for a while, a message came back.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She says she can come here in 30 minutes if you can wait.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I can wait.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, it&rsquo;s determined that Yamanaka-senpai will be coming here.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really do anything. I&rsquo;m curious about this
                        too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we had some time, I decided to ask Asahina-senpai about her school life,
                        her
                        special tests and such.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.1hmsyys"><span class="c20">Part 5</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were only a few minutes left until the appointed time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I finished my drink, a lone male student approached.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Asahina, is this guy Ayanokoji?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Tachibana-kun? It is, but..?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The student called Tachibana pulled a chair and sat down.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then put his arms on the table, and began speaking while pitching
                        forwards.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you want with Yamanaka?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tachibana Kento. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s a classmate of Yamanaka in year-three D Class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it might be Ansai coming up here, but it was another new face.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, how do you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamanaka-senpai contacted you, huh? Did she ask you to check up on
                        us?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I&rsquo;m the one that should be asking questions,
                        right?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s my senior, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
                        losing his bullish attitude. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think he is above Ansai in terms of physique and mentality.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to guess when she&rsquo;s sending others for her.
                        It&rsquo;s
                        about Kiryuuin-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you have to do with it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have no direct relation to her, but Kiryuuin-senpai asked me to find out
                        the
                        truth.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you playing detective? Go tell her that nothing has changed,
                        then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She was ordered by Nagumo to frame her for shoplifting,
                        right?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Tachibana-kun, is that really true? I don&rsquo;t think Miyabi would
                        do
                        something like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t? Nagumo is the kind of guy that would be perfectly fine
                        with
                        doing something like that. Isn&rsquo;t he using us like slaves?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From what I can see, he isn&rsquo;t a part of the faction that supports Nagumo.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could even say that he is in the anti-Nagumo faction.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We gotta obey even if we don&rsquo;t like it, though. Just like Yamanaka
                        did.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tachibana sighed and tilted his head slightly.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you get it, don&rsquo;t bother Yamanaka again. Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, but that&rsquo;s not possible. Nagumo-senpai hasn&rsquo;t confirmed
                        what she said.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can blame anyone you want, but the truth is the truth. We can&rsquo;t
                        disobey Nagumo.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I heard. It&rsquo;s because you have a contract with Nagumo-senpai,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tachibana looked at Asahina with a look that said &ldquo;you even told him about
                        that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You must get it, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There should have been a way for the classes to collect private points and
                        redistribute them for class transfers themselves. What&rsquo;s the reason for everyone obeying
                        Nagumo&rsquo;s instructions?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it. Before he came to us with the contract, the D
                        Class or
                        C Class had almost no class points left. We couldn&rsquo;t have gathered 20,000,000 points as a
                        class in one
                        year. The possibility of graduating in A Class was 0. If we make the contract, however, we can
                        be allowed to
                        win in the Special Tests. In other words, we can receive class points. Is there any choice but
                        to say yes?
                        Besides, if we ignored Nagumo&rsquo;s contract, we would have to thoroughly fight against
                        Nagumo. What would
                        happen then? The class points we had left would be taken away, and we would continue receiving 0
                        private
                        points monthly.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo didn&rsquo;t miss his chance to make use of the strength and advantages of
                        his
                        own class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In addition to a stable school life, if Nagumo recognized me, I would be
                        given
                        the chance to graduate in A Class. Only an idiot like Kiryuuin could refuse that.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By being under Nagumo&rsquo;s control, one can maintain a certain amount of class
                        points.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if you have to give up 75%, you will always have some left over each
                        month.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once the contract is signed, it&rsquo;s difficult to break it due to its
                        content.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one or two people revolt, they will be found out by someone snitching on
                        them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So even if Nagumo embezzles a large amount of money, no one is able to
                        complain.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re not dissatisfied. We
                        definitely can&rsquo;t complain, though. It&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re a talented person, but
                        for someone
                        like me who has to rely on someone else to get into A Class, the lottery is the last thing we
                        have
                        left.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if you are exploited for private points until graduation, you can still win
                        the
                        lottery. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if there is only one ticket, I suppose a one in a hundred chance isn&rsquo;t
                        so
                        bad.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said one of the instructions was to pin the crime of theft on
                        Kiryuuin-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tachibana looked down for a moment, then he nodded quietly.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of his intermediaries. He said that he would value me if I
                        was
                        able to frame Kiryuuin for shoplifting.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really get what you mean by intermediary. The more people
                        involved, the more of a risk there is of the secret being leaked. Besides, if a large number of
                        people
                        challenge a single event, each person&rsquo;s contributions will naturally be
                        dispersed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be less time-consuming and risky for Nagumo to approach a girl like
                        Yamanaka
                        directly. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is there really a need to pass things on from Nagumo to Tachibana, and to
                        Yamanaka
                        from Tachibana?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This point is stuck in my mind and won&rsquo;t fall into place.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, I can&rsquo;t trust everything that this Tachibana is telling us.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looks like he&rsquo;s telling the truth, but he&rsquo;s still speaking too
                        honestly.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were given hush money by Student President Council Nagumo,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of, of course. The only thing is, I can&rsquo;t be blamed for naming names
                        if
                        I&rsquo;m in trouble. Yamanaka and I both&hellip; don&rsquo;t really have a sense of
                        responsibility, if I
                        say so myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s saying that he quickly confessed after being pressed. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was very confident when he showed up here, but I can take a peek into his weak
                        attitude here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tachibana-senpai. You may not be the real criminal. But, you will be
                        treated
                        as such by the school if this gets out. Are you prepared for that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Nagumo would never let the public know about this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe not, but Kiryuuin-senpai is furious. You must have noticed in these
                        three years that there&rsquo;s no stopping her if she wants to confront someone,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; Ansai was pretty frightened too&hellip;&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You got instructions from Student Council President Nagumo. Then, you
                        chose
                        Yamanaka-senpai as a girl who could get close to Kiryuuin-senpai and recruited her. You tempted
                        her by
                        saying she would gain reputation if she succeeds. That&rsquo;s the whole truth. Do you swear
                        it&rsquo;s all
                        true?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I set my camera to video mode on my phone and brought it close to
                        Tachibana&rsquo;s
                        eyes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you swear?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I brought my phone close to him to remind him again, Tachibana brushed it
                        away
                        with force.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then forced me to stop the recording.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no need to panic. Why don&rsquo;t you want me to record
                        it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because, you know, just give me a break!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Tachibana-kun!?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Asahina tried to stop him, but Tachibana left without looking back.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He looked like he wanted to say something, but&hellip; I wonder what it
                        was.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. That reaction just now gave me my target.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? Are you saying you learned who gave them the
                        order?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tachibana obeyed that order and carried it out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he failed and was questioned by Kiryuuin, he mentioned Nagumo&rsquo;s name.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would not admit to anything except that, even at the risk of destabilizing his
                        own
                        standing.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you for today, Asahina-senpai. I think I will be able to solve this
                        mystery soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, right. I&rsquo;m glad you figured it out, but&hellip; Will you tell
                        me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop for now. I don&rsquo;t want to clumsily wrap you up in
                        this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could end it here, but I decided it was best to stop for now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.41mghml"><span class="c20">Part 6</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it took some time, I was able to obtain some important information that
                        led
                        me to the truth of the shoplifting matter. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Asahina&rsquo;s help, I didn&rsquo;t waste any time but that&rsquo;s
                        precisely
                        why I want to stop for a moment. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was on the verge of getting a solution on the day I embarked on my
                        investigation.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can attribute it to good fortune, of course, including unintended coincidences.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not satisfied.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not that Asahina, Yamanaka or Tachibana are lying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would happen if I reported these results to Kiryuuin as they are?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what is the goal of the person who set this all up?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel that depending on the decision and the outcome here, there is a
                        possibility
                        that it will affect the third-years. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to send a message to Kiryuuin, leaving out the crux of the matter.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question is whether or not Kiryuuin will be on board, but since she wants a
                        solution, I don&rsquo;t think there will be any problems.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I returned from Keyaki Mall and reached the dorms.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were no messages on my phone from Kei after all, and there was no sign of
                        her
                        in the lobby.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as she is a parasite of a host, she will not be able to take independent
                        action on her own. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The elevator stopped at the first floor, so I got in and went to the fourth
                        floor.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of Kei, let&rsquo;s get Kiryuuin&rsquo;s matter in order first. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what I was thinking, but&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Welcome back, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I got off the elevator, Ichinose, who was wearing a coat, smiled at me.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she was waiting for me in front of my room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? I just wanted to see you. Is it a problem?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not. Didn&rsquo;t you have to wait a long time,
                        though?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I usually come back at 5 o&rsquo;clock, but it was already around 6 o&rsquo;clock
                        since I had to make a detour because of Asahina and the other year-three students.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose curiously pulled out her phone and checked the time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa. When did it get this late? I never noticed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought she was being considerate to me, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like
                        it.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just how long have you been there?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, a little after school ended&hellip; Since after 4:30 p.m., I
                        think.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she had been on her feet for at least an hour and a half here. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she said &ldquo;see you later&rdquo;, I guess that meant she was going to
                        visit
                        me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d have called first.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if we couldn&rsquo;t meet up right away, I could have told her the time
                        I&rsquo;d be back.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it would be bad to disturb you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not a problem of it being a good or a bad thing, but&hellip;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she isn&rsquo;t bothered by having to wait, there&rsquo;s nothing else for me
                        to
                        say.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s anything I have to talk to you
                        about,
                        but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She apologetically said so while waiting for me to talk.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you make up with Karuizawa-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I said so, Ichinose muttered something like &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Is it joy,
                        sorrow,
                        or something else?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t tell from her expression which one it is.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then&hellip; Can I be just a little selfish? I want to chat with you for a
                        bit. Only if it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem, though&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she took the time to wait here, I&rsquo;m sure that wasn&rsquo;t just to
                        say
                        hello.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay with you, it&rsquo;s okay with me too. Should we go
                        inside
                        my room?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no real reason to refuse. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as there is no contact from Kei, and I don&rsquo;t have to spend my time
                        on
                        something else after this, there&rsquo;s no reason to talk standing here like this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of all, I don&rsquo;t want her body to get even colder here, so I turned the
                        key
                        and opened the door.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit nervous. Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying so and entering the room, Ichinose immediately noticed the
                        difference in
                        the room compared to before.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it was raining the last time you came to my room.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks for back then. Sorry I was soaking wet when I came to your
                        room&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took off my shoes first, then Ichinose followed and neatly lined them
                        up.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turned on the lights, and Ichinose spoke out when she could see around the
                        room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, your room got really cute, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Ichinose said so, her eyes were caught by the changes in her
                        surroundings.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not like there are big changes such as new furniture or
                        redecorations.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there are stuffed animals, hand mirrors, and cushions that look out of place
                        in a
                        man&rsquo;s room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are much more of these small things than there were before.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were all brought in and left behind by Kei who comes and goes in and out of

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone unfamiliar with the circumstances in this school &nbsp;were to look at
                        this room, it would be easy to think that we were living together.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at the kitchen, one can also easily spot matching cups and chopsticks of
                        different colours.</span></p>

                        that there
                        would be changes in my room. In fact, there was no sign of confusion on her face.</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The best way to warm up a cold body is from the inside out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, the room is pretty cold, so I put on the heating and the

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose nodded and took off her coat, and placed it at her feet.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Girls are pretty amazing, huh? Always going to and from school in skirts
                        like

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly cold, but I&rsquo;m so used to living with skirts
                        that
                        I&rsquo;ve never really paid much attention to it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After replying so, Ichinose found a photo frame with a picture of me and Kei,
                        took
                        it, and stared at it for a while.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can I ask you how you ended up liking Karuizawa-san?&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. I never had much contact with her, but I knew she was dating
                        Hirata-kun
                        in the first year. I never thought she would end up going out with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many of the students in Horikita Class are also still tilting their heads.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s hard to get an answer, especially when it&rsquo;s a
                        different class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to answer, but it&rsquo;s a bit
                        hard to
                        do so. It&rsquo;s my first time being in love, so I can&rsquo;t talk about it in detail even if
                        I wanted to.
                        I guess it was just a natural progression of learning together in the class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unable to give any specifics, I just lined up a few commonplace phrases.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Karuizawa-san is pretty cute, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The water in the pot is now boiling, so I poured out the hot water and mixed the
                        powder with a spoon to make cocoa.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So warm.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She held the cup with her chilly hands and breathed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When I selfishly took you to the gym and all that the other day, was that
                        annoying for you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who wanted to learn how you spend your days off.
                        Besides&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pulled out a sheet of paper from a drawer under the desk.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was such a good experience that I&rsquo;m thinking of using this on my
                        next
                        day off.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, a gym admission&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had already finished filling it out with my name, student ID number, and
                        monthly
                        course selection.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always living a slovenly life. I thought I should move my body a
                        little.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. That kinda makes me happy.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose often had a downcast expression up until the school trip.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I feel like she&rsquo;s been smiling more since we spent some time
                        together
                        on our last weekend.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll be seeing each other more often in the gym now, so
                        I&rsquo;m counting on you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm! Me too&hellip; I see, so we&rsquo;ll be together in the gym from now
                        on.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose drank from her cocoa and smiled.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps having something on her mind, Ichinose looked me in the eyes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wait in front of your room just to see you. There was
                        something
                        I really wanted to tell you&hellip; Is it okay if you sit next to me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then lightly patted the empty space on the bed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understood that this was going to be a serious subject, so I sat down next to
                        her
                        as she wanted.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The reason I met you last Sunday was to get closure.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Closure?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To stop my feelings for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose looked decisive and didn&rsquo;t avert her gaze from me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone you like, Karuizawa-san. I can&rsquo;t mess with
                        your
                        relationship. So I thought that day would be our first and last date.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no hint of sadness on Ichinose&rsquo;s face as she said this.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s what she had on her mind when we were spending that day together
                        when
                        we went to the gym.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that what you mean by closure?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose firmly nodded.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t meet with you in our private times any more. I thought that
                        would be the right thing to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s true, that creates a contradiction with this time today.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it&rsquo;s not a day off, this is still a private time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, I was wrong. That kind of thinking wasn&rsquo;t correct. I figured
                        that
                        nothing would change that way.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I still don&rsquo;t know what conclusion she came to.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this change in thinking is probably the reason Ichinose was able to regain
                        her
                        current cheerful attitude.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should do from now on&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her smile appeared to be the same as usual, but also a little different.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until now, I had interpreted Ichinose as being a relatively easy person to read
                        the
                        expressions of.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Ichinose now often showed me a face that I can&rsquo;t read the true
                        meaning
                        of.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know, that day&hellip; I did decide on one thing. I decided not to ask
                        about your girlfriend Karuizawa-san ever again.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because it hurts. It makes my heart ache. I thought I would feel pain if I
                        asked.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose muttered while choosing the words to convey her feelings.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, right after the gym, I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from asking about
                        her.
                        About who liked whom first.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did ask me that. Now I know how she felt then.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did it hurt?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Strangely, it didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the moment I noticed that my way
                        of
                        thinking was wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer you came to?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose slowly took a breath, and looked straight at me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I do love you, after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t hesitate. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She has no intention of letting me go. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what her eyes said.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew again at that moment how much I love you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was supposed to be the first and the last date, then she would step aside.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, she came to the opposite conclusion.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought that I can&rsquo;t stay in the dark. I have to change from the
                        bottom up.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s the moment that Ichinose changed after remaining in the
                        dark.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, is it okay if I touch your face?&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After I jokingly said so, Ichinose softly laughed and nodded.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then reached out with her right hand and touched my cheek.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She put in some force, and pulled my face towards hers.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done something like this with anyone. I&rsquo;ve never
                        felt
                        anything like this for anyone. My heart is always thumping so hard, and I&rsquo;ve been in so
                        much
                        pain&hellip; but, right now, I&rsquo;m so happy. Just having the person I love beside me fills
                        my
                        heart.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Ichinose was being so open, I wanted to ask her something.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I asked you on the school trip too. I asked if there was something you
                        wanted.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. What I wanted was first of all to be in A Class. Me and my
                        allies&rsquo;
                        objective. Back then, I lost sight of it and lost motivation, thinking that it was impossible. I
                        even
                        thought that I had no choice but to leave this school.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are things different now?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They are. I want to remain here. I want to go for A Class. I want to get
                        it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand on my cheek tightened.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And, I want one more thing. The person I love&hellip; You.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know already, but I &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. You have Karuizawa-san. I know that. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not
                        asking for anything else right now. But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different from here on out. I&rsquo;m going to become a person
                        that
                        you&rsquo;ll turn around and look at.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes were so straight that they never let go of mine even while her cheeks
                        blushed. The last immoral step, Ichinose won&rsquo;t take it. I would have had no choice but to
                        stop her if
                        she would, but she restrained herself from doing so. This is the core of Ichinose&rsquo;s
                        righteousness.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just watch me from now on, Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was always going to watch over your future, even if you didn&rsquo;t
                        want me
                        to.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;End of the school year&hellip; Right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. We&rsquo;ll meet again then, just the two of us. I&rsquo;m going to
                        tell
                        you a conclusion then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My resolve from back then was broken once, but it&rsquo;s completely fine
                        now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s already clear to me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can feel in my skin the enthusiasm and force that Ichinose is releasing.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know how the outcome will turn out, but Ichinose has definitely
                        grown a
                        lot mentally. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is rooted in an intense dependance reliance that is different from that of
                        Karuizawa Kei.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This reliance, which may be a double-edged sword, undeniably gives Ichinose great
                        strength. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s only natural that we want the person we love to respond to us.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it&rsquo;s temporary, you want them to say &ldquo;I love
                        you&rdquo;.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a desire to touch and know what is beyond.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Ichinose won&rsquo;t beg.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s clear that she is determined to win that pledge herself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slowly pulled her hand back.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be leaving now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you out.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. Ayanokoji-kun, you should make up with Karuizawa-san
                        soon, okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll handle it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose took her coat, put on her shoes, and lightly opened the door. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then softly waved at me, and closed it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What followed was silence, and the slight scent of cocoa and citrus lingering in
                        the
                        air. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of world will Ichinose create from now on?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Will she affect those around, and bring a change in my own thinking too? </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m looking forward to my school life even more.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
