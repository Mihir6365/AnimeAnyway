        Ayanokoji Atsuomi’s Monologue
    </h3>
    <div class="main">
        <p>Wealth, poverty.<br></p>
        <p>The difference between the rich and the poor.<br></p>
        <p>High academic achievements, inferior education.<br></p>
        <p>The gap between education.<br></p>
        <p>The city, the countryside.<br></p>
        <p>The gap between regions.<br></p>
        <p>The young who were not blessed, the old who were.<br></p>
        <p>The gap between generations.<br></p>
        <p>This Japan is a society of gaps.<br></p>
        <p>I have only shown one part, but it truly represents both heaven and hell.<br></p>
        <p>The important thing is, that for the most part, circumstance is by no means something that cannot be
            changed. If a man of poverty can grow to become wealthy, a man of wealth can also fall into poverty.<br>
        </p>
        <p>If one is displeased with the disparity between regions, they may head into the big city.<br></p>
        <p>While understanding the logic, I still had nothing.<br></p>
        <p>Born in the countryside, extremely poor, and a pathetically poor academic history.<br></p>
        <p>While understanding the logic, I still had nothing.<br></p>
        <p>Born in the countryside, extremely poor, and a pathetically poor academic history.<br></p>
        <p>With my physical strength also only average, even if I was endowed with perseverance, it is not as if I
            was a hard worker.<br></p>
        <p>If I ever looked strong enough to have the characteristics of a fighter, that was simply my youth.<br>
        </p>
        <p>However, without realizing this potential, I spent my life wasting most of my time away.<br></p>
        <p>I was, indeed, a man crawling on the dirt.<br></p>
        <p>Without the expectation of anything resembling a bright future, there was only the simple possibility of
            living a pathetic life.<br></p>
        <p>However, with my own hands, I cut open my future.<br></p>
        <p>Because I had one thing, just one, that I possessed more than anyone else.<br></p>
        <p>That was, my “ambition”, to keep consistently fighting without halt.<br><br>
            [TL Note 1 : There are two meanings for the word translated into “ambition”:<br>
            1: Ambition, aspiration<br>
            2: Sinister plans, treachery.<br>
            There isn’t really anything indicating it was used with the second meaning but I wanted to let you know.
            The author might have also used this word on purpose to indicate both meanings.]<br></p>
        <p>No matter what, I will rise up to the top of this country.<br></p>
        <p>I have lived up until now with that one idea in my heart.<br></p>
        <p>That ambition alone was what supported my life.<br></p>
        <p>As I faced my 25th years of age, for the first time, I gained eligibility to be elected in politics.<br>
        </p>
        <p>I had saved up a sum of 3,000,000 with my part-time job.<br></p>
        <p>With this, I was to become a politician, a member of the assembly, and make a name for myself as a man of
            great fortune.<br></p>
        <p>A faint, hard to achieve dream. Taking the election lightly, I failed in a way that was painful to even
            watch.<br></p>
        <p>It would have been fine if it had ended there, but as I could not even reach the minimum amount of votes,
            the 3,000,000 that I spent all my life saving up was confiscated.<br></p>
        <p>Poverty resolution, clean politics, countermeasures against the declining birthrate, wage increases, NO
            WAR.<br></p>
