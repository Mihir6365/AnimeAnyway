    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The 2nd term is finally coming to an end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The school trip passed away like a fading dream, but it&rsquo;s soon the winter
            vacation for the second years. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Winter is the end of the year, the season of farewells.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The lowest temperature today is 1&#8451;, so it&rsquo;s been quite cold.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The students running through the road are also chatting about the cold while blowing
            out their white breaths. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every morning, I watch this uneventful daily scene and carve it into my
            memory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This may be pointless for someone who only lives in the now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, what about the ones who know this time is limited?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would happen if they knew that they could only look at this scene for one more
            year?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think that they would see this daily life as a glittering gem. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While waiting for someone to come and gazing at the scenery of daily life, a message
            arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come to the student council room after school today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The forceful text that didn&rsquo;t let me say yes or no came from Nagumo. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The student council room?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not very interested, but, thinking about the future, I can&rsquo;t refuse
            him so easily. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, even if we had a conflict of interest, we cooperated in the culture
            festival.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave a short reply only saying &ldquo;okay&rdquo;, and turned the screen
            off.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I returned to gazing at the students and the scenery, Kushida entered my line of
            sight. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiled and waved, not really giving me a proper greeting. So I raised my hand up
            in response, but &mdash; just before she passed, she glared right at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing...? Since the morning.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I waved at her because she waved at me, but why do I have to be glared at? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think she wanted to confirm no one else saw her face, but I don&rsquo;t know what I
            did.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understand if this is because she simply hates me because of our history
            but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel like she just did a hit and run on me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry Kiyotaka! I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just then, she came running from the direction of the dormitory and called out to
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only a few minutes late, don&rsquo;t worry about it so
            much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But...! Anyway, isn&rsquo;t it too cold to wait out here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were supposed to meet in the dormitory&rsquo;s lobby, so she showed me a
            suspicious expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. More importantly, you missed a part.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei must have been in quite a hurry, as it is unlike her to make a mistake like
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She covered her face in shame. Then, she used her fingers as a comb to try and fix
            it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, no matter how many times she tried, it jumped back up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uaah, what should I do..!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need to worry that much. Hondou and Ike come to class
            with way worse bed-hair.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t compare me with boys!! Ugh, I&rsquo;ll go to the toilet when we
            get to school...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei started walking while hiding her bed-hair with embarrassment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with caring about the way you look.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>


    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c12"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c20">Part 1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c12"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reaching the classroom first by myself, I sat down on my seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good morning, Kiyotaka-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, good morning.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surrounded by girls, Yousuke called out to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;m happy that he greeted me, but I don&rsquo;t like that all the girls are
            staring at me as if saying &ldquo;give me back my Hirata-kun&rdquo;. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This may be necessary, but please tell me if I can help you out with
            anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was wondering what he&rsquo;d say, but it&rsquo;s this again?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been saying that every day recently?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yousuke looks concerned about the group of 3 looking over here from a distance.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I used to be a member of that group, so I guess they are concerned after I
            left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yousuke really hasn&rsquo;t been himself since the school trip ended.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yousuke also worries about people even if they say he shouldn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;ll let you know if that time comes, thanks. It&rsquo;ll be a lot of help
            if you could keep quiet and watch over me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I made sure that I conveyed the fact that I can see his good will.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess Yousuke will keep speaking out to me on a regular basis until our
            relationship is restored.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really no good. I just can&rsquo;t stand to see the instability in
            the class, so...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seems to dislike the fact that he can&rsquo;t stop himself from putting his
            feelings into words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yousuke always blames himself, even if he hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, the girls are waiting for you. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m worried
            about.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The envious looks that say &quot;How long are you going to monopolize Yousuke?&quot;
            have grown more intense.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Kei entered the class, Yousuke returned to the girls. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the bell ringing and Chabashira-sensei entering the class, a new school day
            started. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sure the lack of warning won&rsquo;t surprise you any more, but you
            will be taking the 2nd term&rsquo;s special test right before winter break.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My classmates had gotten used to the special exams, but they were quite shaken, as
            everyone thought things would remain the same until winter break.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oops. Looks like I surprised you a little this time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were also a lot of big events going on like the culture festival and the school
            trip, so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a school like this, all that stuff and the special exam are different matters,
            though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there&rsquo;s only a little more than two weeks left to conduct the special
            exam.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose long term preparations and measures weren&rsquo;t needed, so I wonder what
            it&rsquo;ll be about?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand why you&rsquo;re nervous, but there&rsquo;s no need for that. In
            the first place, it isn&rsquo;t the kind of special exam that has a risk of causing dropouts.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like the most important factor, which is expulsions, will not be relevant
            this time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, there is no avoiding the change of class points. Since you&rsquo;re
            aiming for the A Class, I&#39;m sure this isn&rsquo;t something you can afford to lose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can&rsquo;t catch up and overtake them by just winning one or two times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we have to be prepared to win all of our battles from now on.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For this special exam, there aren&rsquo;t any complicated rules that have to
            be beaten into your heads. It will be a one versus one of academic ability with the other
            classes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A duel of academic ability. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not a surprising test for this school, or this school&rsquo;s
            students.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather, it&rsquo;s the standard.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We compete with each other even in the midterms or the finals.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, needless to say, when it&rsquo;s a special exam, there are always some
            special rules that affect the outcome.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The winner will receive 50 class points from the loser. You get 50 class
            points for winning, and lose 50 class points if you lose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s a big number, it would be a rather low
            fluctuation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a class-based competition, then wouldn&rsquo;t it be a bad idea
            to fight Class A !?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rejoice, Ike, because you will be fighting Class A.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that our opponent was already decided, so we were confronted with a cruel
            reality by Chabashira-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th place classes with the highest average scores in the
            recently held final test will be competing in a straightforward fashion. There are some special rules, but
            the fact that the lower ranked classes and A Class are competing against each other will also have a
            significant impact on the outcome.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As of December, the class points are 1250 for Sakayanagi&rsquo;s A class and 985 for
            Horikita&rsquo;s B Class. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we win the head-to-head match up, we will be close to 165 points after deducting
            100 class points.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will also be on our way to surpassing the 1000 class points mark for the first
            time since our enrollment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, Ryuuen&rsquo;s C Class has 684, and Ichinose&rsquo;s D Class has
            655. If Ichinose wins, she will reach C class again, and if she loses, there will be one more step between
            her and A Class. It&rsquo;s a tough development. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, even if it&rsquo;s an easy fight, they haven&rsquo;t won even once with
            academic ability up until now. One could say they are 1st and 2nd place, but the difference in their
            academic ability still isn&#39;t small.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The questions are from all permanent subjects on the midterm and final exams.
            From the easiest to the most difficult questions, it will be the same as the regular written tests, no,
            perhaps more difficult.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the academic level of this class is growing at a rate that is head and
            shoulders above the others, the possibility of turning things around is low, even if my classmates study to
            death for the next two weeks.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s talk about how you guys can win.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The detailed contents of the special test appeared on the screen.</span></p>

    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">The students will solve the questions in a determined order. </span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Each student can solve 5 questions at most, but everyone has to solve at least 2
            questions, correctly or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Regardless of if it&rsquo;s correct or incorrect, a student&rsquo;s solution cannot

    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Each student will be given a maximum of 10 minutes, including time to enter and exit
            the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">All students except those challenging the test must wait in a separate room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">The next student must wait for their turn behind the door.</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">If a student goes over the time limit, he will fail and gain no points.</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Leaving a written or verbal hint is a violation of the rules.</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">If a violation is found, the test will be forcibly terminated and a score of zero
            will be given.</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">There will be a special bonus added on according to the remaining time.</span></p>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A test in which the number of points obtained increases or decreases according to the
            student&#39;s ability, regardless of difficulty.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems out of the norm, but it is a very fitting rule for a special exam. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is also A + for academic ability in the OAA and there seem to be 5 categories,
            so the students with A + may have a slight advantage. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;These are the written test&rsquo;s rules. It may seem advantageous for the A
            Class who has a lot of members with high academic ability, but there is a high percentage of students in the
            OAA with Academic Ability B or above. In other words, they will earn less points for solving problems. Do
            you understand what that means?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While there are many students in the Horikita&rsquo;s Class who have made remarkable
            academic progress, there are also some students like Kei, Satou, Ike, and Shinohara, who are still stuck at
            the bottom. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they won&rsquo;t be able to solve many questions, this means that they can
            get 4 or 5 points by just managing to solve one question. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This certainly can&rsquo;t be said to be a purely academic contest, and I can&rsquo;t
            say that this is disadvantageous for the A Class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather, it can be said that the developments and the outcomes will be beyond the
            scope of our imaginations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is a point bonus for the remaining time, but I&rsquo;m not sure if this is that
            realistic.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Including the time you enter the room, the count-down starts from the moment you put
            your hand on the door handle. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are 38 people in the Horikita Class. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they can&rsquo;t manage to solve the questions in one or two minutes each, then
            it&rsquo;s impossible to leave at least an hour remaining. There is also a risk of the students with low
            academic ability making mistakes because of the time limit</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This addition from remaining time is more of a consideration for the side that is
            winning in the Academic Ability OAA.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, paying too much attention to the time loss is also a danger.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We have plenty chance of winning - that&rsquo;s the kind of special exam this
            is.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like Horikita also understands the winning chance that the rules give us.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. Of course, the students in A Class are well rounded
            academically from the top to the bottom. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll score well. Even though we have many
            Academic ability D or below students here with a potential for high scores, if they don&#39;t answer the
            questions correctly, they&#39;ll still receive 0 points.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still this is much better than facing them head on.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I would also like to add something about the acts of cheating stated in the
            rules. Conversations are forbidden while in the waiting classroom or with students who have finished their
            tests. There will be a few students waiting in each classroom, but please refrain from needless
            conversations. I recommend you don&rsquo;t throw away the test with one simple mistake.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure the students will already take the fact that we will be strongly
            observed into consideration.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, if someone is absent on the test day... What happens then?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If one person is absent, two questions will be unanswerable. If two people are
            absent, four questions will be unanswerable and they&rsquo;ll get 0 points. The time limit will remain the
            same. Further, the questions that will be unanswerable are decided at random before the test starts. Also,
            it&#39;s unlikely, but if there is a tie, there will be no change in class points.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which means that intentionally making someone absent would be a useless
            strategy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Classes with a lot of students like the Ichinose and Ryuuen classes have the
            advantage of being given more time, but I can say that this has no effect on the points they can earn by
            solving questions. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As it is the most efficient and ideal thing for an unexpected student with a low OAA
            rating to solve five questions and get a score, the number of students only has a minimal impact.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, we each coincidentally have the same number of people anyhow, so this talk is
            in itself meaningless.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You gotta talk among each other and think about what is your best chance to
            win against A &nbsp;Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chabashira-sensei said these words, like a mother watching over her children. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About the date for the special exam, we decided to give you some time until
            right before the winter break. The test subjects are very numerous, so we decided some time was necessary.
            This will be difficult, but if you succeed, you will get closer to A Class. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like the scope of the test will be announced tomorrow, so this is the end of
            the discussion here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Schedule</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">December 22....The Special Test</span></p>
    <p class="c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">December 23.... Announcement of the special test&rsquo;s results, 2nd term closing
            ceremony</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it&rsquo;s right before the 2nd term ends.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, there&rsquo;s only 3 weeks remaining until the test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the students with high academic ability usually have a different attitude
            towards their studies and wouldn&rsquo;t mind this time restraint, the key to victory lies with the students
            who are below average in academic ability.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I looked at each class&rsquo;s academic ability on the OAA and investigated
            the situation. As we have a lot of students with D or E academic ability here in B Class, our points will be
            increased. In other words, in the most ideal situation, we have a 100% chance of winning.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the students with lower academic ability in the OAA can gain more points, no
            matter how much they study, the points that A Class can gain are limited.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, this is just in theory. The probability is as thin as a sheet of paper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With almost 40 students participating, a perfect score is almost impossible. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking Chabashira-sensei&rsquo;s comments and the rules of the special test into
            account, I can expect that there will be a high percentage of difficult questions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the questions could be solved by students with E or D in academic ability, that
            would be rather unbalanced.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be an absurd test that gave a disadvantage to the classes with higher
            academic ability.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">We need something like a study group, but I doubt that alone will lead to
            victory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also important who solves how many problems before passing the
            baton on to the next person.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yousuke asked so to Horikita in a calm tone of voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. The simplest way would be to put the students with low academic ability
            in front and have them solve as many problems as they can, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time limit is 10 minutes. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ability to read through and understand the problems will also vary depending on
            the student.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be challenging to quickly find the easy problems out of the 100 problems on
            the test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the students with high academic ability get through the difficult questions first,
            it will take the lower students less time to find the right problems and they will be able to be more calm
            and focused.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who can solve which problems?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Understanding that and directing the students accordingly is also a winning
            strategy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure there are several other ways to do this. In the end, the important
            thing is to decide the strategy early on and get the class moving.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Chabashira-sensei said there&rsquo;s a chance we can win, but&hellip;
            We&rsquo;re still in an unfavourable position.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they score well, we probably won&rsquo;t win. Our opponent is the A Class,
            so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">My classmates began talking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up until now, A Class has never been below the others in total score in a pure
            written test. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with the special rules, there&rsquo;s no changing the fact that they are a
            formidable foe.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re up against A Class this time, but we&rsquo;re actually competing
            with ourselves. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what strategy they come up with. There&rsquo;s no need to get too
            worked up just because our opponent is Sakayanagi-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She emphasized that we should be facing inside, and not outside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will think as much as I can about a strategy. In the meantime, I would like
            you all to study as much as you can, even one second counts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up until now, no, until a few weeks ago to be precise, the students were studying for
            the final test. Even though it&rsquo;s a student&rsquo;s job to study, I&rsquo;m sure everyone will get sick
            of it after having to study again in such a short period of time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, I can&rsquo;t even see one student expressing their dissatisfaction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll back you up as much as we can.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yousuke replied so to Horikita, and the students like Yousuke and Mii-chan who do the
            teaching part in the study groups took the initiative and started moving.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Alright! I&rsquo;m getting excited! Personally, I have mixed feelings about my
            OAA going up, but I&rsquo;m going to contribute as much as I can!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sudou, who had received a grade of E in academic ability, is up to C+ now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The score he can earn now is lower than before, but he&rsquo;s made a big leap in his
            ability.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he was still E in academic ability, he would have a hard time even solving the
            problems.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After school, I slipped out of the class as they started their discussion and arrived
            at my destination pretty much right on time. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I almost knocked right away, but I heard people talking inside the room. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I can&rsquo;t hear what they&rsquo;re talking about through the thick
            door.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I might be able to hear some things clearly if I keep listening for a while, but my
            appointment was just a moment away, so I quickly discarded the option of eavesdropping.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Hi.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I entered the student council room right at the instructed time. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two boys were already sitting in the student council room, and one of them quickly
            stood up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry for calling you out here, Ayanokoji.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, but I&rsquo;m a little nervous seeing the student council
            president and vice president standing ready like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said something that an average student would say.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Sorry, but you don&rsquo;t look so nervous to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo crossed his legs and pointed at me after he spoke, signalling me to approach
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama moved to a position slightly behind Nagumo where he could still be
            seen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he looked at the screen of his phone after taking it out of his pocket.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, in less than a second, he turned it off and returned it to his
            pocket.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one who spoke after that wasn&rsquo;t student council president Nagumo, but vice
            president Kiriyama.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After this, I also called in student council members Horikita and
            Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Horikita and Ichinose?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Assuming this combination is not a coincidence, they&rsquo;re both second-year
            students who are in the student council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to rush things, Kiriyama. Don&rsquo;t you think
            Ayanokoji wants to chat with us for a bit too?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it. I can see from his face that he
            wants to keep this short.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt gratitude in my heart for Vice President Kiriyama&rsquo;s accurate
            judgement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still, there&rsquo;s a lot of things I want to prepare for the next special
            test too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;The special test? Us year-threes aren&rsquo;t going to have another special
            test in the second term, are we? Besides, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve already decided that
            you&rsquo;ll be the winner, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not understanding why he said this, Nagumo gave a suspicious side-ways glance at
            Kiriyama.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still. I want to be prepared for any unexpected situation. Many more
            year-three students than you think are aiming for victory. What if a student who can catch me off guard
            shows up?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those fools are already all expelled. There&rsquo;s no one else left for you
            to call an enemy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The year-three students don&rsquo;t have much time left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Nagumo holding all the authority, they have to somehow get the ticket for
            20,000,000 points, so they&rsquo;re still fighting over that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s no wonder that Nagumo is so optimistic that he has no enemies. Since
            Nagumo holds all the necessary tickets, no one can defy him. If someone doesn&rsquo;t comply with him,
            including Kiriyama, they might be stripped of their ticket to advance to the finals.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, however, those who have not been given a ticket are not bound by
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">It&rsquo;s a grandiose idea, but one could expel Nagumo and accumulate private points
            from there. &hellip;No, I doubt that would be profitable for them, though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Nagumo is expelled, his huge amount of private points will probably return to the
            school. Because without such a contract, he would not be able to protect himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Nagumo&#39;s existence also includes the funds for their own rise to
            power. Except for Nagumo&rsquo;s private points, the private points collected in the 3rd term would only be
            enough to save one or two students.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there something in your mind? Kiriyama. You&rsquo;ve been flaring up at me
            all day since this morning today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there&rsquo;s something in my mind or not, does it?
            &nbsp;Even if I say something now, you&rsquo;re not going to stop in your tracks on &ldquo;this
            matter&rdquo;, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Am I wrong?&rdquo; Nagumo nodded at the strong verification and
            laughed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, Kiriyama. This is a personal decision that I have to settle while
            I&rsquo;m still in this school.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, please take into account my desire to quickly get it over
            with.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like there was a bit of an argument going on before I entered the room
            too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s certain that &ldquo;this matter&rdquo; Kiriyama has been pestering Nagumo
            about all day isn&rsquo;t something that Kiriyama likes. No, it&rsquo;s probably not something I&rsquo;d
            like either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine, fine. I&rsquo;ll make our chat quick. Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose there is no choice but to have this chat, so Nagumo got confirmation from
            Kiriyama.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There will be another matter about a different student council issue, so
            please keep it short.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">In the end, Kiriyama agreed, and Nagumo began what he judged to be a necessary chat
            or whatever.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You year-two students seem to be in an unusually tight race.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In our generation, and in Horikita-senpai&rsquo;s generation, A Class always
            had a big lead by the middle of the second year. I&rsquo;m a little envious that you get to enjoy it until
            this time of the year.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the past, the war between classes was usually settled by the end of the first year
            to the middle of the second year when the difference in class points became too large.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The class that started as A Class detached from B Class and below and graduated as A
            Class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were rare cases such as Student Council President Nagumo&rsquo;s B Class
            turning into A class, but in any case, one class always had the lead by the middle of the second
            year.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, in our year, the point difference is so tight that even the D
            Class still has a chance of turning around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like all four classes have a chance for now, but I&rsquo;m sure
            that&rsquo;ll end by the final test.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think so too. There&rsquo;ll be two classes&hellip; at most three classes
            competing for the seat of A Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo and Kiriyama both made that judgement without hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The final test for the year-two students is going to be intense,
            huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. The contents of the test are of course different, but the results will
            mostly be a tragedy. Last year, I had all of the year-two students under my control at the time of the final
            test, and was in a position to control the test itself. I kept the damage to a minimum, but three students
            still dropped out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">Nagumo tried to prevent it from happening, but there were inevitable
            casualties.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was a way to reduce the number of expulsions to zero, but there was
            nothing I could do when I weighed the decrease in class points and private points I could
            gain.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This story may be true, but whether it&rsquo;s helpful or not is another
            matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is unlikely that the final test we&rsquo;ll take and the final test Nagumo and the
            generation above experienced are the same in content. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the scale will mostly be the same. Anyone can easily see that if
            they&rsquo;ve been spending their lives in this school all this time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s enough idle talk. Please enter the main subject,
            Nagumo.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Quietly urged so by Kiriyama, Nagumo shrugged and showed his white teeth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the first place, I&rsquo;m about to finish my role as Student Council
            President. Which means that we have to decide the next Student Council President.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already had a longer term in office than the previous presidents,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Horikita Manabu to Nagumo Miyabi. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The baton of the Student Council President should have been passed earlier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also remember that Nagumo himself said that he would extend his term in
            office.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was my intent, but the school approached me many times, you see.
            Apparently, I would be depriving my juniors of gaining experience if I put it off any longer. Well, there is
            some truth to that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Except me and Nagumo, all of the year-three students have finished their
            duties in the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next Student Council President will be decided, and these two will be relieved of
            their posts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, I see.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, Nagumo decided to give up his position as Student Council President.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would explain why they are calling in the names they mentioned earlier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Suzune or Honami? I have to decide which of the two is more suitable to be the
            next Student Council President.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have the power to appoint someone, don&rsquo;t you, President
            Nagumo?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I do have that authority.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, shouldn&rsquo;t you be talking with Horikita or Ichinose instead of
            me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said something very obvious, but I can see from his lack of surprise that he is
            already aware of this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a waste to just pick one myself, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Considering the fact that you called me here&hellip; Well, I can
            guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You and I are going to decide who the next Student Council President will
            be.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You want more than just support from me, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about various methods of competing with you, and this
            should be a good way to do it. Horikita and Ichinose are both second-years like you. They probably have as
            much information as we do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not surprising that Nagumo wants to settle this as soon as possible,
            seeing as he does not have a lot of time left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t think Nagumo would believe this is the ideal way to fight.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, he must have decided that this was better than nothing at all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is still the option of postponing it. Taking last year as an example, I
            wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there was a special test where we team up and compete with each other like in
            the training camp.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, if that time comes, we can call this matter the warm-up
            match.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">Not wanting to delay it any further, Nagumo wants to surround me so that I
            can&rsquo;t flee.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agreed to have a duel, but I won&rsquo;t agree to have a second
            one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am interested in Nagumo, but I can&rsquo;t keep wasting my time on him
            forever.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are things I want to do for the future too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you saying you have the right to refuse?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to turn this into a senseless game. If you really want
            this battle of deciding the Student Council President, then I&rsquo;d like you to consider this our real
            duel.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine with me, but it&rsquo;ll be a fight where you have a high
            chance of losing. You know that, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As long as the current students are given a right to vote, all of the
            year-threes will vote as you want them to. In other words, one-third of the votes have already been cast.
            That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. You can barely make things equal even if you gather all the year-twos
            together. Well, that may be impossible, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since our opponent Ichinose is in the same year, the votes of the year-two students
            will inevitably be split.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you could do me one favour, I think it&rsquo;ll be a good
            match.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very interesting. Try me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I only want you to make the voting anonymous. If it&rsquo;s only the school
            who knows who voted for whom, I can think that we&rsquo;re even.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. Do you think that the year-threes won&rsquo;t vote for
            my candidate then?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I can at least imagine the possibility of that increasing.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anonymity is ensured, there will be no need to follow the rules.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">Even if there was the promise of a reward like private points, it&rsquo;s impossible
            to prove unless the Nagumo side gets close to zero votes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still, do you really think that half the people in year three will become your
            allies? That&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t know until I try.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama is watching quietly as Nagumo and I talk.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, with only that condition added in, you accept the duel?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re strangely confident, as usual. Well, whatever. If you believe
            that it will be an equal duel then, I have no complaints either. But, before determining this affair, you
            should know that I want something to bet on the duel.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course. If there are no bets, it won&rsquo;t hurt or itch to lose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure Nagumo doesn&rsquo;t want to cut any corners with me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, it&rsquo;s inevitable that there will be a bet where I&rsquo;ll have no choice
            but to win.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you ready to bet everything? Ayanokoji.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I return those words right back to you? We can even bet over dropping
            out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to say, but that&rsquo;s a
            bit difficult.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. You have not just your own fate, but the fate of all the
            year-three students in your hands. No one would accept the risk of dropping out in that situation. I am
            willing to bet on dropping out, but in that case, please let me demand a corresponding reward.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A corresponding reward?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;If I win, I want to receive your private points. Enough points. Enough to buy
            a ticket to move to another class, if possible. Even under the Special Test&rsquo;s rules, I need that many
            private points to prevent expulsion. It shouldn&rsquo;t be too much to ask.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, betting over expulsion itself has that much value, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With both of our interests aligned, we came to an agreement on the duel&rsquo;s
            direction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was Kiriyama listening from the side, who called a halt to this.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew that you&rsquo;d be dueling with Ayanokoji, but I can&rsquo;t agree on
            the contents of the bet. I can&rsquo;t let you gamble such a large amount of money on a game.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, Kiriyama. Do you think I&rsquo;ll lose with these rules? Ayanokoji said
            we&rsquo;d be even just with the votes being anonymous, but he&rsquo;s way off the mark.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll lose, but the possibility still isn&rsquo;t
            zero. It also depends on whether you will support Horikita or Ichinose. Most of all, 20,000,000 points is
            too many. If you can pay that much to Ayanokoji, use that money to save one of the year-three students
            instead.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s no surprise that Kiriyama is objecting, but Nagumo shows no signs of
            backing down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can spend the money I acquired through my ability however I want. It&rsquo;s
            always been that way.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...No matter what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No matter what. I&rsquo;m going to win this fight and get Ayanokoji
            expelled.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. Why do you care about a year-two? I can&rsquo;t agree
            with this method.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama kept opposing him, but Nagumo doesn&rsquo;t look like he intends to
            listen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept your wish, Ayanokoji. If you beat me, you&rsquo;ll
            definitely be in A Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you really sure? We could end this with you simply going down on your
            knees with a small bet, but with 20,000,000 points, I&rsquo;m going to adhere to the term of expulsion no
            matter what. If you want to lessen the bet, now is the time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Is that what you want?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah. I thought this threat would scare you a little, but you don&rsquo;t seem
            upset.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already factored in the risks to get this large amount of
            money.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prepare the contract. It&rsquo;s one of two things: expulsion or
            20,000,000 points.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that&rsquo;s left is for us to decide who to support, and the match is on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I get the game you&rsquo;re going to play. But whether it will work or not is
            up to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Kiriyama was about to make his last opposition to stop the match, in which a
            huge amount of points will be at stake, we heard a knock on the student council room&rsquo;s door.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nagumo-senpai, it&rsquo;s Ichinose. Horikita-san is with me too.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A clear voice. It seems that both candidates have arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Nagumo, if possible, don&rsquo;t talk to them about the match, and
            don&rsquo;t talk to them about the bet either, of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama has a point, as this is probably not something that Horikita and Ichinose
            should be told about.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I doubt they would feel good about the fact that they are the object of a match or
            bet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have no objection to that proposal, do you, Ayanokoji?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay with it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&hellip; Are you really sure? If we call those two in here, that means the
            match has already started.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama looked at me and stopped me, signaling that there is no turning back after
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to risk dropping out to go along with Nagumo&rsquo;s
            games.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Getting a ticket to A Class isn&rsquo;t easy though, is it? So, it&rsquo;s
            only natural that there is a corresponding risk to it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really not hiding your true colours anymore either, are
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Passing into bewilderment from anger, Kiriyama took out his phone and looked at the
            screen for a second time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine. You two can do as you please. Come in, you two.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama approached the door and urged the two to enter as he opened it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo always acts on his own accord, so Kiriyama must have a really hard time as the
            Vice President.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that sense too, moving forward with this matter of changing the Student Council
            President isn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as they entered the room, they noticed my presence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s obviously not normal for me to be here, so I have no need of a special
            mention.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please sit next to Ayanokoji.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita sat next to me, and Ichinose next to her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, I could see Horikita saying &ldquo;are you getting wrapped up in
            something weird again?&rdquo; with her eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the exception of Kiriyama who returned behind Nagumo, the conversation resumed
            when everyone sat down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I decided to have you conduct the election for the next Student Council
            President.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Election, is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t this common in middle school too? The candidates will give
            speeches, and the students will vote for who is the most suitable for the post of Student Council President.
            Whoever gets the most votes is the next Student Council Body President.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. I don&rsquo;t remember an election like that happening last year,
            though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Normally, the current Student Council President, like me, would decide
            the next president. If the person I pick accepts it, they become the Student Council President. Of course, I
            would not name someone who hasn&#39;t achieved the results that would convince the people around
            them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Student Council President is decided not at random, but on a proper
            foundation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo made sure that we would remember that point.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, the situation is a little different for you year-two students.
            We&rsquo;ve always had at least two, or ideally three names from the same year as Student Council Members,
            but only Honami served on the Student Council last year, and Suzune who joined in year-two hasn&rsquo;t been
            a member for even a year.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can understand that there were no students who joined at the same time, but
            I think it would be fine to pick Ichinose-san as the Student Council President. I don&rsquo;t think she has
            any weak points.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita stated that she wants to give up the seat to her opponent Ichinose without
            hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not like she entered the Student Council to become the Student Council
            President in the first place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to become Student Council President?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. I&rsquo;m feeling positive at the moment, including
            in the sense of following in my brother&rsquo;s footsteps. If the current students want me to run for
            election, I&rsquo;d be happy to do so, but at the same time I think that there are no problems with the
            president being Ichinose-san either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honami certainly has no weak points. She&rsquo;s a good choice. However, there
            are other things to be concerned about.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose reacted by slightly shrugging.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Currently, the possibility of Honami&rsquo;s class graduating as A Class is
            extremely low. This is a problem. Historically, all of the Student Council Presidents have graduated in A
            Class. This isn&rsquo;t a tradition or any such thing, but it is something of a silent understanding. I will
            be among them, of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is true that her position quickly becomes dangerous when you cut out the part of
            whether Ichinose can graduate in A Class or not. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita on the other hand is in B Class and going for A Class, so the probability of
            her fulfilling that silent understanding or whatever is higher.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honami has a lot of achievements, but Suzune who has less is closer to A
            Class. After taking a lot of things into account, I decided that you two are currently almost evenly
            matched. That is why I decided to hold an election.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as Nagumo has the authority to decide the Student Council President, even if
            it is on a far-fetched basis, no one can object to his instructions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing left is the decision of the persons in question.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. In that case, I will be running.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s decided, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the duel between Horikita and Ichinose to become the Student Council President
            begins.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayanokoji, I&rsquo;ll let you pick who to support.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can do that much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita or Ichinose? Honestly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, but&hellip; If he is
            letting me decide, then I have to think about who would be the more beneficial choice for me in the
            future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Horikita stood up quicker than I could name her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Please wait a bit, Student Council President. Why is Ayanokoji
            here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a match to see who can become Student Council
            President, you or Honami.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought we weren&rsquo;t going to talk about that to these two.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama seems to be holding his forehead, but I guess there was no way Nagumo was
            going to listen to him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re really doing this..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t me who suggested it, so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so, don&#39;t you think there are any problems with how things got
            here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s insightful. That&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t deny.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Nagumo has a conscience too, as he isn&rsquo;t mentioning the bet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on, pick whoever you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had made up my mind and was about to say out loud the name I picked, but I was
            stopped again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait. This is an unprecedented experiment. I think I should add a few more
            words.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama, who had been listening up until now, interrupted us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it? Are you still dissatisfied with where this conversation is
            going?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is a Student Council election. It will be a big psychological load on
            both sides. I want to confirm whether or not they really want to run, and that they have the qualifications
            to become president.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already confirmed that, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t. We got an answer from Horikita, but I haven&rsquo;t
            heard anything from Ichinose yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Do we really need to ask?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Kiriyama turned his gaze to Ichinose, the door suddenly opened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna bother you guys a bit, Nagumo.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Kiryuuin who suddenly entered the room without permission as if simply
            visiting a friend. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We haven&rsquo;t met face to face like this since summer, but she looked to be in a
            bad mood and her usual smile was lacking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What an unexpected guest. Didn&rsquo;t you think to knock once, at
            least?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure Nagumo doesn&rsquo;t welcome this guest, as he wanted to finish the
            discussion about the election.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re busy now. Let&rsquo;s do this later.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo tried to chase Kiryuuin out, but she didn&rsquo;t look to be listening.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I already asked Kiriyama to make some time for me. Are you trying to put me
            off?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While looking gloomy because of Kiryuuin, Nagumo looked at Kiriyama for
            confirmation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Nagumo, but what she&rsquo;s saying is mostly true. I made a
            mistake with the time coordination.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was a very careless mistake for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no excuse for it. She&rsquo;s involved in another matter that I
            wanted to have you solve today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know the details, but that was the exchange between Nagumo and
            Kiriyama.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You heard him. So, won&rsquo;t you listen to me, Nagumo?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand the situation, but I&rsquo;m talking about something very
            important relating to the Student Council with these guys right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;I can see that you&rsquo;re busy, but I don&rsquo;t have that much time
            either. I got an appointment for this time, so I think you should respect that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s certainly no reason for Kiryuuin to back down. It&rsquo;s
            Kiriyama&rsquo;s responsibility for having made a mistake with the appointment&rsquo;s timing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My priority is to talk with Suzune and Honami right now. If you really are in
            that much of a rush, you can quietly sit and wait there.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Kiriyama is currently the only one who knows the reason for Kiryuuin
            showing up here, so Nagumo tried to handle it as he could.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it&rsquo;s obvious Kiryuuin is very annoyed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I refuse.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying so with a slightly raised voice, she put her foot up on an empty
            chair.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First of all, I&rsquo;ll be the one asking you a question. Depending on the
            answer, this chair may become the victim.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is she going to kick it off, or break it?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s obvious that the fate of the chair that Kiryuuin is putting her foot on
            depends on what&rsquo;s about to happen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama looked at Kiryuuin, who was showing no signs of leaving, and apologized
            again to Nagumo.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Kiryuuin, so it might be counterproductive to clumsily chase her
            out. It would be better to stop this discussion for a moment and hear her out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Horikita and Ichinose are the priority, if Nagumo says to wait, then
            I&rsquo;m sure they will do so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin on the other hand looks very grumpy, so it&rsquo;s clear she wouldn&rsquo;t
            wait.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we can&rsquo;t chase her out or make her wait, the quickest thing is to talk to
            her first.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please do not worry about us and talk with Kiryuuin-senpai first. You are fine
            with that, right, Horikita-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Yes, I think that would be best.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As both parties came to that conclusion without waiting for a direct confirmation,
            Nagumo seems to have no choice but to decide to deal with Kiryuuin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good grief&hellip; Fine, I&rsquo;ll listen. Why did you come
            here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell Nagumo about it, Kiriyama? You really are bad at
            arranging things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand how you feel, but I&rsquo;m very busy too. I also thought it
            would be best if you talk to him directly about something this ridiculous.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems he deliberately didn&rsquo;t inform Nagumo of the reason she came
            visiting.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin kept glaring at Kiriyama with cold eyes, but it seemed like there was no
            choice but to clear things up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to the main subject, then. I wanted to talk to you first
            before making a decision. So, I&rsquo;ll ask you. Who is the one that asked a third party to harass
            me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Harassment? That doesn&rsquo;t really tell me much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more concrete, then. This underhanded, dirty plan of setting me
            up to look like a shoplifter - was it you who put it in motion?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shoplifter, an unexpected word.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose reacted more quickly than anyone else.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tried to stay calm, but it was clear that she was nervous on the inside.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it is for the sake of her family, she does have a history of dirtying her
            hands with crime.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shoplifter? I really can&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re talking
            about.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me supplement, Nagumo. It looks like Kiryuuin was framed as a shoplifter
            in Keyaki Mall the other day. She says that while shopping in a cosmetics store, Yamanaka, a year three D
            Class student, tried to hide lipstick and other goods in her bag. When Kiryuuin noticed this and confronted
            her, she told Kiryuuin that you ordered her to do this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">Kiriyama delivered Kiryuuin&rsquo;s accusations in simple words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So that&rsquo;s why she came over here like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The reason I didn&rsquo;t convey this directly to you is that I know you
            wouldn&rsquo;t have ordered something like that. Right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama implicitly conveyed that he trusts Nagumo on this point.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo is showing a neutral attitude both to Kiryuuin and Kiriyama&rsquo;s
            questions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you state definitely that you weren&rsquo;t involved?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like Kiryuuin clearly accuses Nagumo of setting her up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. It looks like you&rsquo;ve already made up your
            mind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamanaka said so herself when I caught her on the act. Is that not
            enough?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe she just used me as a convenient excuse?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin lightly shook her head in response.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamanaka would know it&rsquo;s a bad idea to give your name if you&rsquo;re
            unrelated. In fact, there would be a lot less trouble later if she gave the name of another student. Am I
            wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s true that Kiryuuin&rsquo;s words and thoughts make sense.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the year-threes are controlled by Nagumo. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they have a ticket to Class A or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">I can&rsquo;t think of a merit to lying about being ordered by Nagumo while under his
            control.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she got in trouble with Nagumo for this, it would be a great hindrance to the
            student named Yamanaka.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s precisely why after Nagumo&rsquo;s name came out, it can&rsquo;t be
            helped that Kiryuuin thinks it was by his order.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I were in the same situation, I would be blaming Nagumo too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still, are you really so angry about shoplifting? This isn&rsquo;t like
            you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me well enough to say that it isn&rsquo;t like me.
            Unfortunately, I already hate acts like shoplifting. I&rsquo;d hate to hurt someone else for my own sake
            just because there won&rsquo;t be a problem if it doesn&rsquo;t get revealed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the way she&rsquo;s talking, I don&rsquo;t think Kiryuuin knows about
            Ichinose&rsquo;s past.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Kiryuuin is clearly expressing her disgust about the subject matter,
            Ichinose&rsquo;s expression is rapidly darkening.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo noticed the change in Ichinose&rsquo;s attitude, and knowing the
            circumstances, he interrupted.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine, I understand what you&rsquo;re trying to say.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like Nagumo was making light of the subject of shoplifting on purpose in
            front of Ichinose, but it seems to have had the opposite effect.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you admit it? That you tried to frame me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different issue.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo didn&rsquo;t look to be admitting it, and Kiryuuin continued as if she was
            expecting this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. If you admit your crime here, I promise I&rsquo;ll overlook
            it this time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Nagumo gave the instruction, then he is a criminal instigator.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a case like this, he would receive an even heavier punishment than the person who
            actually carried out the crime.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s clear that Kiryuuin has no plans of making a big deal out of it even if it
            was Nagumo, the leader of the year-threes who was involved in this scandal.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And what if I don&rsquo;t apologize? Will you be satisfied with breaking the
            chair?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought that far.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Then&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo turned his gaze away from Kiryuuin, and looked at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is the end of my chat with you. Can I ask you to leave,
            Kiryuuin?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let alone apologize, Nagumo tried to end the talk without even confirming if it was
            him or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t expecting that, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo coldly said so to Kiryuuin who was utterly amazed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said you got Yamanaka to confess, but how reliable can a confession under
            duress be? Do you think the school will take this seriously even if you skip the Student Council and go
            directly to them?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At the very least, there&rsquo;s a high possibility that Yamanaka&rsquo;s
            movements as she was trying to frame me were caught on camera in the shop. It&rsquo;s not something that can
            just be ignored.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pull up that footage, then. But that&rsquo;s the end of it. It&rsquo;s
            pointless if there&rsquo;s nothing connecting me and Yamanaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only Yamanaka will be punished. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There won&rsquo;t be any proof of Nagumo&rsquo;s involvement. Nagumo is confident of
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The school will do their best to investigate if they hear Kiryuuin&rsquo;s
            accusation, but there&rsquo;s a limit to what they can do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yamanaka lied to cause the downfall of Nagumo, the Student Council president and the
            leader of the year-three students. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">If no conclusive evidence emerges, it&rsquo;s obvious that such an outcome will be
            the result.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We were interrupted, but let&rsquo;s return to our talk. You don&rsquo;t have
            any objections about the election, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Completely ignoring Kiryuuin, Nagumo began to take the final confirmation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m fine with it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita agreed, while still worrying about Kiryuuin who had her foot on a
            chair.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought Kiryuuin might kick the chair away now, but she continued observing, as if
            trying to see through Nagumo&rsquo;s mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Nagumo quickly moved onto Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like they&rsquo;re both going to consent if things go well,
            but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps because of the word &ldquo;shoplifter&rdquo;, Ichinose still has a dark
            expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honami, you&rsquo;re going to run for election too, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Umm, about that&hellip; May I have a word, Nagumo-senpai?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip; I do not want to run in this Student Council election.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t expect her to say that after coming this far.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to become the Student Council President?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;I think the problem is before that. Up until now, I always believed that being
            in the Student Council and becoming the Student Council President was for my own good, and for the good of
            those around me. But I can see now that I was being arrogant. As you said, Nagumo-senpai, the fact that my
            class is so far from A Class is also proof of that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she wants to decline this because of the disappointing position of her
            class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, someone like me would not be a good Student Council President. I am a
            criminal, so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems Kiryuuin unintentionally created a big shadow in Ichinose with her
            words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A criminal?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not knowing the circumstances, Kiryuuin muttered so, but this isn&rsquo;t the place
            to explain what happened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different matter. That doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with
            you now, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. No matter how much time passes, my past crimes
            won&rsquo;t disappear.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After replying so, Ichinose continued speaking what was on her mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rather than run for election, I wanted to quit the Student Council
            today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a bit, Ichinose-san. That might be a hasty decision. You have nothing
            to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no. It&rsquo;s not about today. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it since
            before the school trip.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose bitterly laughed and confessed that she didn&rsquo;t come to this decision
            today.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think you know already, but the Student Council isn&rsquo;t just a burden
            for a student. There are some tedious chores, but it&rsquo;s definitely a plus to be in the Student Council
            in this school. You&rsquo;ve benefited from it too, even if you can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo is right, it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to be a member of the Student
            Council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One would already know this after spending time living in this school, but being a
            member of the student council contributes to your class points, even if only slightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">It&rsquo;s like throwing away a weapon for the Ichinose class, which is in a big
            predicament.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am sorry, but I am not going to change my mind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only does she not want to run for Student Council President, but she wants to
            quit the Student Council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama must be surprised after hearing that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re serious, Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know you helped me out a lot, Vice President Kiriyama&hellip; I am sorry
            that I could not be more dependable.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, continuing or not is of course your decision. I have no right to stop you,
            but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Kiryuuin also seems to have gathered from the flow of the conversation, it would
            be a rather unreasonable idea to say that Ichinose should not be connected with shoplifting.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we can do now is regret the fact that this subject came up at such a bad time.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, I think she would have quit even if it wasn&rsquo;t for the shoplifting
            matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I apologize for not being able to live up to your expectations.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose stood up and deeply bowed to Nagumo and Kiriyama.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think you would make a wonderful Student Council President, Horikita-san.
            I&rsquo;ll be supporting you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ichinose-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose, who was supposed to be the rival in this election, said so with a smile and
            encouraged Horikita.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling a little unwell, so I will be taking my leave. If there are
            any documents that need to be filled out, please send them to me at a later date. See you later,
            Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">After saying so and lightly waving, Ichinose left the Student Council Room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shoplifting affair definitely put her morale down, but Ichinose showed no signs
            of changing her mind on quitting, and she didn&rsquo;t show any signs of regret.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think she was being serious when she said she was already thinking about it
            before.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t only Nagumo and me who felt that this was an unexpected
            development.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita, who expressed that she would be running for presidency also felt the same
            way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ichinose-san has resigned from the Student Council, so what should I do
            now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems like Ichinose&rsquo;s departure from the Student Council will carry this
            fight away with her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure that even Nagumo won&rsquo;t have any other choice now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also impossible to come up with a replacement for Honami this
            late.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know the rules of other schools, but in this school, a student who has
            not done some voluntary service in the Student Council may not be qualified to become Student Council
            President.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like how this went, but I&rsquo;m going to have you become the
            Student Council President, Suzune.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most important thing to avoid would be the absence of a Student Council
            President.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly selecting an inexperienced year-two is also quite unreasonable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought there would be an election so I am a little disappointed,
            but&hellip; I understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this uncontested victory, Horikita is going to become the Student
            Council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Before that though, I have one job for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;What would that be?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fill in the hole left by Ichinose as soon as possible. Call at least one
            person from year two to join the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, after Ichinose&rsquo;s departure, Horikita is the only year-two student in
            the Student Council. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If something unforeseen was to happen, the Student Council could become
            dysfunctional.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are there any conditions for who can join?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only one. They need to be someone that is thought to be fitting for the
            Student Council by those around them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, that is very reasonable.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sorry to use him as a reference, but I think he means that he won&rsquo;t
            let anyone with a bad reputation like Ryuuen enter the Student Council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can see that there are no restrictions on whether she can pick from her class or
            the other classes, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, as long as they meet that condition, I can move to acquire anyone I
            want?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saying it simply, you&rsquo;re free to bring in anyone from your own class.
            Even Horikita-senpai had people from his own class in the Student Council, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One more thing. You need to pick a member from year one too. There was a
            vacancy created when Yagami unexpectedly dropped out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita&rsquo;s expression became stiff as she was handed down this difficult order
            from Nagumo.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Recruiting two people is the same as recruiting one. I will do my
            best.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not being in a position to refuse, Horikita honestly answered so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;ve reached an agreement.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin, who had been watching over us, called out to Nagumo once again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She may have thought that she couldn&rsquo;t talk freely with a year two student in
            the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita, who had been given a new duty, read the atmosphere in the room and stood
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me, then. I will report back to you after deciding on the two
            names.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. After that, I&rsquo;ll officially hand you the seat of the Student
            Council President.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita also slightly bowed to Kiryuuin who had been watching over the situation,
            and left the Student Council room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the Student Council President election gone, the battle between me and Nagumo
            also went along with it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I&rsquo;m going to leave, this would be the best time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I should be going too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a bit, Ayanokoji. I&rsquo;m not done talking with you yet.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo wasn&rsquo;t going to let me leave so easily, so he strongly stopped
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep forcing this. The conversation with Ayanokoji ended with
            Ichinose&rsquo;s refusal. It&rsquo;s okay to back down here, you should be handling the affair with Kiryuuin
            instead.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin agreed with Kiriyama&rsquo;s thinking that they should not be leaving the
            problem unaddressed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty useless, but I appreciate that remark. Please make a wise
            decision, Nagumo.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsch&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo clicked his tongue in frustration, but he had no choice but to agree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he made sure at the end that I know he doesn&rsquo;t like the idea of
            letting me go like this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a student in Suzune&rsquo;s class. Help her out with gathering

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think that&rsquo;s true for everyone in my class, though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, there&rsquo;s nothing for me to help out with that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This seems completely arbitrary, but it&rsquo;s pointless to oppose him here.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I am not sure how much I can help, but I&rsquo;ll try my best, then.
            Probably.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo won&rsquo;t let go of this point that leaves me an escape route.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure that Suzune knows you&rsquo;ll help her out. Don&rsquo;t
            slack off, okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was considering acting innocently and not going along with him, but he beat me to
            the punch.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand, I will help her out. Are we good now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Nagumo finally showed his understanding and his opposition to letting
            me go disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Here, a present for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took out one of the few extra Hokkaido souvenirs I bought and handed Nagumo a
            bag.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is a pretty strange timing to be so conscientious.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here meeting with the Student Council President, after all. I
            thought I should give you a present.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a failure to hand this over at the last moment instead of at a better time,
            though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there one for me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were going to be here, so you can share with Student
            Council President Nagumo if you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I handed a souvenir to Kiriyama, and Nagumo started muttering as if he remembered
            something.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since the school trip has ended&hellip; The next special test should be
            announced around now, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring Kiryuuin, Nagumo started talking to me again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was announced just today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, it looks like it&rsquo;s the custom to announce the special test after a
            school trip. So, your opponent class will be Sakayanagi and the A Class, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite good at predicting things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the way Nagumo speaks, it looks like the top classes and the bottom classes
            compete with each other every year.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was your class and Student Council Vice President Kiriyama&rsquo;s class
            facing each other last year, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What was the result?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your class was the winner, right, Kiriyama?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kirayama calmly replied so without much joy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin from the same class doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much to think about here, so
            she&rsquo;s quietly ignoring this matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Normally, it would be really difficult to win against A Class, but you should
            have a pretty good chance with this test, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it depends on your viewpoint, but you may be right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think the special tests they conduct around this time are usually
            advantageous for the bottom classes in order to make for a better competition between the classes. So they
            set things up in a way where it&rsquo;s easier to win for a class starting from the bottom.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, the classes that hold the key in this special test are the Horikita Class and
            the Ryuuen Class. Both bottom classes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Nagumo allowed Kiriyama&rsquo;s B Class to catch up to them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d be able to win in any situation, Student Council President
            Nagumo.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I win if it&rsquo;s not going
            to have concrete effects.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo&rsquo;s class is already running solo at the top, so I think he&rsquo;s saying
            that an insignificant victory isn&rsquo;t worth the effort.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just as usual, A Class got ahead of the others from the start in Horikita
            Senpai&rsquo;s time too. I was in B Class, but I quickly rose up to A Class and we got far ahead of the
            others. As a result, the difference between A and the classes below was massive at this time. But it&#39;s
            different for you guys. A Class is certainly in the lead, but it&rsquo;s not in an absolute safe zone like
            in the past.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s very true, as the reason that the Horikita Class&rsquo; motivation is so
            high right now is because of the fact that they are still in reach of A Class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wonder how things would be if the difference between A class and B class was around
            1000 points at this time. It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered who won.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, good luck.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I will contact you again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was finally allowed to leave after saying that, so I left the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phew&hellip; I&rsquo;m finally free.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After what happened with Ichinose resigning from the election, the matter with 20
            million points came to nothing, but it&rsquo;s not a hindrance to my plans.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After my brief moment of relief, someone who&rsquo;s been watching from afar started
            approaching.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They kept you there for a long time, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have you been waiting?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was very curious about what you were talking about. Did you get some kind of
            order?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it looks like I lost my part in this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still, you were in there talking for a long time, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I handed them souvenirs from the school trip and discussed some unrelated
            things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now, I won&rsquo;t mention the fact that I&rsquo;ve been asked to help
            out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll wait for Nagumo to convey the order to Horikita and for her to directly
            ask me for help.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For you, it&rsquo;s just one job to become the Student Council
            President.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I never thought that Ichinose-san would decline and even quit the
            Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Same here. Leaving aside the duel about who gets the seat of Student Council
            President, I thought she would stay in the Student Council until the end.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never imagined that she would throw away her position by her own hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This matter may be one of the reasons for the tears she showed me at the school
            trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is Kiryuuin-senpai still in there talking with them?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like it. I&rsquo;m sure you could also tell how mad she
            was.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t know much about that person, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want her
            to be my enemy. Student Council President Nagumo looked to be having a hard time with her too.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the viewpoint of a Student Council member, I&rsquo;m sure Nagumo always looks
            like he&rsquo;s in control, so there&rsquo;s no wonder Horikita noticed the difference.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About Student Council President Nagumo ordering another year-three student to
            frame her for shoplifting, how much of that do you think is true?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who knows? One thing is for certain though, which is that the student named
            Yamanaka is being blamed for it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s also unclear if there&rsquo;s another third party involved.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whether the perpetrator is Nagumo or someone else, I can&rsquo;t see any
            reason or objective to entrapping Kiryuuin.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about someone seeking revenge on her for something?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, of course. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine that there&rsquo;s
            someone out there who hates her.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no point for us to strain ourselves thinking about this matter,
            though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;More importantly, shouldn&rsquo;t you be focusing on the Student
            Council?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Things will be a lot easier just with you becoming an
            officer in the Student Council, though. I&rsquo;m sure I can easily clear Student Council President
            Nagumo&rsquo;s terms with your help.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that. At the very least, I know that Nagumo
            doesn&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a matter of liking or hating you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s not true. This must be unpleasant for Nagumo, it has to
            be.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t want to enter the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I enter the Student Council, I&rsquo;m going to have a lot less free time.
            I&rsquo;d like to avoid that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can I ask you to help me out with finding some personnel, at least?
            You&rsquo;re responsible for pulling me into the Student Council in the first place, so I don&rsquo;t think
            you&rsquo;d decline.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She quickly finished off with that, cutting off my path of retreat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not really interested in something like that. Sorry, but
            it&rsquo;s a pass. You&rsquo;re the one involved in the Student Council, so you should be the one solving
            their matters.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps getting used to my uncooperativeness, Horikita sighed and backed down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Personally, I&rsquo;d like to enlist someone from my own class. As the Student
            Council President already said, it&rsquo;s a plus for the class to have someone in the Student
            Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think Yousuke would gladly cooperate on most things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. It would be hard to get him to give up his club activities,
            though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can&rsquo;t participate both in the Student Council and in club activities, and
            Yousuke is showing great results in the soccer club.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s little merit for him in moving over to the Student Council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to get away from this place, but Horikita got in front of me and blocked my
            path.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave the Student Council aside for now. Ayanokoji-kun, about the
            special test-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, but there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about that either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You told me that the Student Council should solve its own issues, right? But
            the special test relates to our class. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be shutting up and helping me out here as my
            classmate?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anyone else you can ask for help? You have almost 40
            classmates.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no reason for her to specifically rely on me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good grief. You&rsquo;re really not going to help me out, huh?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like things will suddenly change just because of my
            cooperation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being too humble? I&rsquo;d feel reassured if you lend me
            your help. I mean, our opponent is Sakayanagi-san. If you help us out in the strategic stage, we&rsquo;ll
            have a better chance of getting through this, like the Athletic Festival.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we lose, there&rsquo;ll be 100 more points between us and A Class, but we can
            still recover after that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no advice for me to give you. But, as your classmate, I will
            follow your instructions. If you order me to solve a highly difficult problem, then I will
            obey.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I won&rsquo;t lend a hand at this stage, but I let her know that I will cooperate in
            the test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Are you saying that you&rsquo;ll solve any problem, no matter the subject
            or difficulty?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. My Academic Ability in the OAA was B Rank in December. I
            can&rsquo;t get many points, but be it the minimum of 2 or the maximum of 5, I&rsquo;ll solve as many
            problems as you want me to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This must be very important for Horikita, so I&rsquo;ll make sure to guarantee her on
            this point.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind helping me out as an individual, but you won&rsquo;t lend
            a hand in the preliminary stage. Is that it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the possibility of you being wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Almost 0.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as there are no problems outside the fundamental subjects or questions of
            miscellaneous knowledge, I won&rsquo;t have any issues.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How confident. But I&rsquo;ve been hearing that maths is your only specialty,
            though?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good grief. After muttering so, she nodded back in agreement with my offer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s agree on that, then. If I can take into account that a student
            with a B in Academic Ability will reliably solve 5 questions, that&rsquo;ll definitely make things
            easier.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Handling this is a necessary experience for Horikita to gain as a leader.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Letting aside winning or losing, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d want to learn what she
            can from this test.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I do sympathize with you. This was a really bad timing to be made Student
            Council President.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would have been better to solve this issue at a less busy time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no helping it now. I knew things like this might happen when I
            entered the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s more like I (not really, but&hellip;) made her join the Student
            Council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure she has a few worries, but Horikita walking by my side seems
            relatively positive.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thinking negatively won&rsquo;t help anyone. We need to be positive and look
            at things on the bright side here. My reputation in the school will increase after becoming Student Council
            President, and I&rsquo;ll also have some more power. I won&rsquo;t abuse my authority, but I&rsquo;m going
            to be in a gray area very close to that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One has to use any means they can to rise to A Class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s a good thing. In fact, I think Horikita should be a little more
            greedy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can help me out too, you know? With picking new Student Council
            members.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop repeating yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought you might have forgotten now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep declining.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I just hope things get settled before Horikita learns that Nagumo told me to help
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c20">Part 3</span></h3>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I sowed the seeds myself, I got wrapped up in something that&rsquo;s
            almost unrelated to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would have liked to have done something like the Student Council election to settle
            the value of my relationship with Nagumo, but no one could have predicted Ichinose&rsquo;s resignation, so I
            guess it can&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to call my girlfriend to give her a report, who I was making wait in the
            dorms.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming back yet!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as soon as the call began, Kei&rsquo;s discontent voice came through.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just left the Student Council room. I&rsquo;ll be back in about 15
            minutes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought she would still be mad, but it looks like the fact that I made the timing
            clear won her over.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ve been waiting here without bothering you. Aren&rsquo;t I
            great?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She suddenly started speaking more gently and asked me so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very admirable.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Girls like Kei use their cellphones well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I&rsquo;m sure she could keep sending messages every few seconds.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehehehe.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a compliment, but she seems happy so far.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the short exchange, I put my cellphone into my pocket.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even without lengthy conversations or such, I realize that the romance phase has
            progressed and we&rsquo;ve established a relationship. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that family members can detect any slight difference isn&#39;t because
            they&#39;re smart or perceptive.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s only that one notices these changes easier after spending a long time
            together with the person.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not a matter of reading the other person&#39;s thoughts, but of feeling each
            other&#39;s skin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can change a tense situation into a gentle one in an instant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s like Two sides of a coin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This applies to many things other than what I just said.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The remaining pages of the textbook are decreasing moment by moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the textbook becomes more difficult towards the end, and it takes more time than
            at the beginning. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, onto the next subject&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
