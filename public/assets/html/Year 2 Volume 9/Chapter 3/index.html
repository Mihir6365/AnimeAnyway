    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c21 c33"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was early December, just before 2 pm on a Saturday - the weekend had
            arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two days ago, Kanzaki contacted me and arranged for us to meet at Keyaki Mall.
            Although a specific meeting place was not decided upon, I quickly found him and his peers as soon as I
            entered the mall.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki, who had been scanning the entrance to Keyaki mall, noticed me right away and
            approached with his hand slightly raised.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry for bringing you out here on your day off.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On days off I tend to take it easy. There&#39;s plenty of free time, I welcome
            invitations like these.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I reassured him that it wasn&#39;t an inconvenience and there was no reason to worry.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alongside Kanzaki was Himeno, Watanabe, and Amikura.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought it was only going to be Himeno, seems like there are others that
            will be joining us as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My apologies, that was supposed to be the case but some circumstances have
            arisen.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki attempted to explain the details, but was interrupted by Watanabe and
            Amikura.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yo Ayanokoji, it&#39;s pretty cold today huh&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good Afternoon, Ayanokoji-kun&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe and Amikura smiled at me in the same manner as they did when we had
            interacted with each other during the school trip. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I responded with nods of acknowledgement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki had informed me of only Himeno&#39;s presence beforehand, so I was a bit
            surprised by the combination of these four people. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was unclear what their intentions were, but perhaps Watanabe and Amikura were
            necessary to Kanzaki and Himeno&#39;s plan. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then again, was it just a coincidence that all happened to be together during the
            school trip?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s understandable that you&#39;re confused. I never imagined these two
            would be here.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno, also somewhat unsettled, slightly nodded her head in agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though there were more questions arising in my mind, Kanzaki was concerned with the
            increasing number of students. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mall had been relatively empty when I arrived. But now students were coming to
            shop one after another.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well the Christmas sales have started after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura pointed towards the shops as the mall grew more and more crowded.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, the shops are already decorated in Christmas colours, and the words
            &quot;Christmas Sale&quot; appear on the shelves of various products.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For now, let&#39;s relocate to somewhere less conspicuous. We don&#39;t want
            outsiders, especially those in Sakayanagi and Ryuen&#39;s class, to become aware of our group&#39;s
            existence if we can help it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given that I can easily surmise the situation around here without needing to ask for
            more details, there&#39;s no reason for me to decline. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While there wouldn&#39;t be an issue if it were just the four of them, my presence
            would make the gathering appear peculiar and inexplicable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, I would prefer discussing matters in a quieter setting away from this
            bustling thoroughfare.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, why don&#39;t we head to the usual karaoke spot?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within the premises, one of the few secluded areas was the karaoke room, which is
            often used for studying and strategic meetings. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura suggested we head there for the time being, it can be reached on foot from
            here in about three minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s a secure location. Let&#39;s go right away.&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki took the lead and started walking, with me following a few steps
            behind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did I interrupt a serious discussion? I&#39;m sorry, for some reason I
            didn&#39;t expect it would be like that.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura, who was walking beside me, whispered apologetically. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judging from her tone of voice, it seems that they ended up joining us on a
            whim.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who lined up next to Amikura, &nbsp;provides additional details of the
            situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was more of a coincidence that Amikura and I came here. We overheard a
            conversation between Kanzaki and Himeno. Since it sounded like they were meeting up with Ayanokoji, we asked
            if we could tag along.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, right. Originally, I was planning on going shopping with Watanabe-kun
            today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Amikura responded, Watanabe seemed a little bashful but happy, though somewhat
            sorrowful as he looked away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you don&#39;t need to go shopping then?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of them were empty-handed, and there didn&#39;t seem to be any indication they
            purchased anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not really that big of a deal. You could just go buy it
            later.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki, who was walking ahead of us, heard the conversation and turned back to
            explain the details again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Initially, I thought only Himeno and I were needed for this meeting. However,
            after learning that Ayanokoji helped both of them out during the school trip, I changed my
            mind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Helped out? That&#39;s supposed to be my line</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe and Amikura were a big help in many ways during the school trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am grateful to both of them, but I don&#39;t feel as if I&#39;ve done anything to
            earn gratitude in return. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve decided that it&#39;s time to take a step further
            then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked Kanzaki about it, he nodded his head while showing a cryptic
            expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it? What do you mean by &#39;step forward&#39;?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;ll tell you the details later.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the briskness in his strides, I could sense a feeling of impetuousness from
            Kanzaki. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had a hunch about the reason behind it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.z337ya"><span class="c20">Part 1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The four of us, who had finished checking in at the karaoke reception, were led to
            the designated booth. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the guest, I was escorted to the back, where Watanabe, Kanzaki, and the boys were
            already seated. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We couldn&#39;t just sit there without ordering anything, so we all casually ordered
            drinks.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, are we going to sing something right away... or not?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe picked up the microphone from the table and jokingly directed the tip
            towards Kanzaki like he was conducting an interview.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki, who wasn&#39;t as comfortable with this kind of light-hearted banter (like
            myself) made a troubled or angry face before lightly swiping the microphone away with his hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, but can we leave that for later?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Yeah, you&#39;re right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe shrinks back dejectedly and retracts the microphone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First of all, I&#39;ve already explained the details of today&#39;s discussion
            to Himeno, but the other two are hearing it for the first time. As I said before Ayanokoji arrived,
            everything that will be discussed here is privileged and not a word of it will be uttered to anyone else.
            Can we all agree to that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that Kanzaki had already informed them that this conversation would be
            confidential before allowing them to accompany us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. No matter what we talk about, we promise to keep it a secret,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mmm. No problem.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Including Amikura, it seems both of them take pride in their tight-lippedness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it seemed that Kanzaki still didn&#39;t fully trust those two despite their
            assurances.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, but I&#39;m still doubtful.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to prove his point, Kanzaki conveyed his thoughts without concealing
            anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi Oi..... Then what are we supposed to do?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe also had misgivings about this situation, he was still suspected even after
            promising not to tell anyone else. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, based on the implications of the forthcoming conversation, Kanzaki&#39;s
            judgement is correct. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it was just about &#39;crossing the bridge safely&#39;, he could have refused to
            let Watanabe and Amikura come along, who followed out of curiosity. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he didn&#39;t. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, he meticulously confirmed their intentions, using it as a way to test their
            resolve. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki is likely taking a gamble here, his doubts were a testament to his desire to
            trust and rely on them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should we sign a document or something? &lsquo;I swear not to speak a word of
            this to anyone else&rsquo; like that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. A written contract, that&#39;s a viable option. It&#39;s feasible to
            even record it on a portable device too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By having them pledge not to speak of this in front of a camera and threatening
            punishment for any breach of trust. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s one way to ensure they won&#39;t talk. Without hesitation, Kanzaki took out
            his cellphone and placed it on the table, almost flaunting it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you being serious? I have to admit, that would make me a little
            uneasy.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura responded, displaying a hint of repulsion, finding it hard to believe a
            fellow classmate would suggest such a thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&#39;t I tell you? We&#39;re here today to have an important conversation
            with Ayanokoji. I believe that if this conversation is leaked, it could have immeasurable consequences later
            on.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t that a bit exaggerated....or maybe it isn&#39;t?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki wasn&#39;t the only one watching Watanabe. Himeno was also staring at him
            with a stern look.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me ask you one more time. Can you promise that you won&#39;t tell
            anyone?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Embracing the consequences of potential animosity towards him, Kanzaki placed his
            hand on the phone and confirmed it once again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point if they don&#39;t want to shoulder the responsibility, they should
            consider leaving. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Kanzaki&#39;s determination and intensity had permeated deeply into both of
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I promise, I won&#39;t speak a word of this to anyone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...me too. It would be pretty lame to leave now just because we&#39;re not
            confident we can&#39;t keep a secret between us. And if it helps you can record the conversation on your
            phone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they broke their word and spoke out, at the very least they would disappoint both
            Kanzaki and Himeno. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they don&#39;t appear to be particularly close, everyone held a clear sense
            of the boundaries they believed that must be protected as a group. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Convinced, Kanzaki put away his phone, looked away from the other two, and directed
            his attention towards me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So there you have it. With that settled, we will proceed with Watanabe and
            Amikura present here as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never had any objections from the start. This is ultimately an issue that
            must be dealt with by the Ichinose class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there were indeed subversive elements present, the responsibility would lie with
            Kanzaki for making a poor judgement call.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That reminds me, before we get to the main topic, there&#39;s something I want
            to inquire about. It&#39;s a rumour that most of the class, including Watanabe and the others, have heard
            about: that Ichinose is leaving the student council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; This wasn&rsquo;t just a casual check, it&rsquo;s a
            serious request for a confirmation. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There hasn&#39;t been any official communication about Ichinose quitting since a
            replacement member hasn&#39;t been announced yet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, as the recruitment process continued, rumours spread and eventually reached
            the ears of Kanzaki and others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What makes you think I am privy to such information?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because Ayanokoji&#39;s name was also mentioned in the rumours.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the slightly suggestive wording caught my attention, the mystery was
            resolved by Watanabe&#39;s subsequent remark.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was also a rumour that Ayanokoji is joining the student
            council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s funny how rumours spread. Someone must have seen me with Horikita, who is
            set to become the student council president, and assumed that &lsquo;Ayanokoji would join as well&rsquo;
            &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; resulting in falsehoods being spread as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It will become clear soon, but it&rsquo;s true that Ichinose is leaving the
            student council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true after all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Ichinose may not have denied it if asked directly, perhaps Kanzaki and the
            others were not brave enough to confirm it with her. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they were to ask her why she was leaving, it might lead to further questioning
            like: &quot;How?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; and potentially risk creating dissonance in the class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sure Ichinose wants to tell everyone as soon as possible, but the
            student council president, Nagumo, has ordered her to keep it a secret until a replacement is decided. So
            she can&#39;t say anything, even if she wants to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was important to make this point clear right from the start in order to avoid any
            misunderstandings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s up to Ichinose to decide whether she continues with the student
            council or not. I understand that neither I nor anyone else in the class has the right to interfere.
            However, the negative impression it leaves is hard to erase.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, does that mean Ichinose-san has really given up on moving up to Class A
            after all?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Kanzaki, who was beating around the bush, Himeno stated it plainly. Ichinose
            left the student council at a time when they were desperately struggling &nbsp;against the other classes, in
            pursuit of Class A.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the right approach, this could have been framed as a positive development.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Had Ichinose communicated to her peers about redirecting the energy and effort she
            was investing in student council work towards focusing solely on their class, she could have potentially
            turned her departure from the student council, at a critical point of the class competition, into a display
            of determination.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given the current circumstances, with her class on the verge of dropping out of the
            competition, leaving the student council may be perceived as surrendering a key weapon that could have been
            used to pursue victory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, it&#39;s safe to say that Kanzaki and Himeno interpreted it this way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand...</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s jumping to conclusions, Himeno.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm, that&#39;s right. I don&#39;t think Honami-chan would give up on Class A
            so easily.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, Amikura, who was steadfast in hope, rebutted immediately.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, why did she quit the student council?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe she left the student council to alleviate her workload and concentrate
            on getting into Class A?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura objected, unwilling to believe that Ichinose had given up on Class A.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who shared Amikura&#39;s view, nodded repeatedly in affirmation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;If only Ichinose had explained everything clearly, we could rest easy,&quot;
            Amikura said.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But didn&#39;t the student council president ask her to keep it a secret?
            Honami-chan wouldn&#39;t break her promise carelessly.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno&#39;s rebuttal was swiftly countered by Amikura with a solid argument.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;If Ichinose was told to remain silent, it would be natural for her to
            wait until she&#39;s allowed to reveal the truth.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The class still believes that Ichinose has not given up on Class
            A&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Kanzaki, are you saying that Ichinose resigned from the student council
            because she gave up on reaching Class A?&rdquo; asked Himeno.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s not what I&#39;m implying. We won&#39;t know the truth until we
            hear it directly from her. However, I want to point out that you&#39;re blindly believing in her. Why
            hasn&#39;t anyone considered the possibility that she left the student council because she gave up on Class
            A?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura, and the others present, have spoken for themselves and their class.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it? Because Honami-chan isn&#39;t that kind of
            person.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I feel the same. Besides, Kanzaki, aren&#39;t you the one assuming that
            Ichinose gave up on Class A? You shouldn&#39;t phrase it like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing Amikura and Watanabe&rsquo;s statements, which seemed to be the epitome
            of blind faith, Kanzaki opened his mouth without hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I strongly support that theory. However, it&#39;s at most a 70&mdash;30
            ratio.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki leaned toward that theory 70% which was not a low number, but rather
            high.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&#39;re always so cynical, aren&#39;t you?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe said, not surprised by the statement itself but rather looking
            exasperated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m not as much of a cynic as Kanzaki-kun, but I believe it&rsquo;s about
            50%&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you serious, Himeno-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, I am. Or rather, shouldn&#39;t we all be a little
            suspicious?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not right. There is no reason to doubt Honami-chan.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno and Kanzaki exchange glances.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One might hope that there were other classmates who shared the same doubts as Kanzaki
            and Himeno. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the reality was likely that there were more students like Amikura and Watanabe.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&#39;t consider the possibility that Ichinose&#39;s heart had been
            broken.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&#39;s harsh how we are speaking, just because she quit the student
            council. ...... I feel sorry for Honami-chan.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand your concern, Watanabe, but there&#39;s no doubt that quitting
            the student council will reduce the benefits for the class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do we even have the right to complain about something we&#39;re not a part
            of?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe&#39;s point has some merit to it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nobody has the right to blame Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If anyone tries to do so, they would be immediately reprimanded. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they don&#39;t want to lose the benefits of being in the student council, they
            should run for a position themselves.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As opposing opinions clash, the karaoke box falls silent. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they haven&#39;t gotten to the main point of the discussion yet, I can
            see the internal dynamics of Ichinose&#39;s class more clearly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The structure, flow, and logic of the conversation are all presentable, and though
            Kanzaki is certainly not incompetent, his arguments were not always concrete and were met with
            pushback.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps there is a discrepancy between Kanzaki&#39;s thoughts and the inability to
            articulate himself properly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">His inexperience in speaking reveals weaknesses.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&#39;s move the conversation forward. Ayanokoji doesn&#39;t really know why
            Ichinose quit, does he?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki, struggling, comes to me for confirmation, needing to hear it from someone
            else. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all share the common understanding of wanting to know why she quit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hate to disappoint, but to be honest, I have no idea what Ichinose is
            thinking right now. I never expected her to quit the student council.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After conveying this, I decided to continue speaking before anyone could respond.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I let Kanzaki take the reins again, the conversation would keep spiralling.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I&rsquo;m an outsider, I should manage the risks here. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Plus, it may serve as a test case that may prove useful for later.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, isn&#39;t someone who spends every day in the same classroom more
            knowledgeable about the circumstances than someone like me?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, yeah, that&#39;s certainly true...Ayanokoji, you really know how to hit
            where it hurts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While it&#39;s fine for Watanabe and Amikura to trust Ichinose, they haven&#39;t been
            able to grasp what&rsquo;s at the heart of the matter. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same goes for Kanzaki and Himeno. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s good that multiple viewpoints of suspicion have emerged in the class, but
            it&#39;s still too early to say that they&#39;ve taken on the role of transforming the class into an ideal
            shape.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It might be a problem that our classmates don&#39;t know anything about
            this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura seemed to have some thoughts on this and expressed regret. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While waiting for the four to answer, a waiter came over to serve the drinks they had
            ordered.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that it had been crowded all day today and it was taking longer than usual.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were asked to order early if we wanted something. Then the waiter went
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kanzaki, before you criticise Watanabe and the others&#39; ideas, you should
            at least be able to confirm the student council situation yourself? Don&#39;t you think so?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But even if I take action openly&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Openly? There&#39;s nothing secret or hidden about confirming Ichinose&#39;s
            true intentions. There are countless ways to contact her, whether it&#39;s early in the morning or late at
            night, or through phone, chat, or any other means.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the same can be said for Himeno, who was also wearing a plain expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you content to just have a few like-minded peers without ever taking any
            action yourself?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I mean... Even if I asked something, I don&rsquo;t think she would tell
            me the truth because I&#39;m not particularly close with Ichinose-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem that Ichinose-class faces is not limited to unilateral delusion based on
            worship.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then it would be good if Himeno became close to Ichinose without any secrets
            and became friends who can confide in each other. If Himeno had done that, this question and suspicion would
            not have arisen.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno, who drew out the information, only needed to share it with Kanzaki as soon as
            possible. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a stiff expression, Himeno seemed unsure of how to respond.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, hold on a second. I understand what Ayanokoji is trying to say, but
            isn&#39;t that going a bit too far?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who had been blamed by Kanzaki and the others until now, came to their
            defence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s not... It&#39;s not easy for Ichinose to tell us the truth.
            Regardless of the means, if we can understand her feelings easily, then nobody would have a hard time,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He answered as if sensing that the atmosphere in the room was getting heavy. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The high consciousness of defending their friends is not a bad thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even in the midst of many negative factors, discussing things like this can reveal
            something.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I usually serve as the leader of the class, but I don&#39;t know the details
            of Ichinose&#39;s gaze or words directed towards our friends. That&#39;s why several questions come to
            mind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;F&mdash;&mdash;For example?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you cannot ask directly, you can still observe and understand naturally. If
            there is a blatantly ill student, anyone would likely notice and inquire with a simple &quot;Are you
            okay?&quot; Even if Ichinose does not always have a poker face, observing changes in behaviour is a
            significant means of understanding emotions.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One essential aspect of decoding emotions is reading the other person&#39;s facial
            expressions. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether Ichinose showed any changes in behaviour before or after resigning from the
            student council and in everyday life is a crucial factor to consider. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if there are no details, it is important to know if there was any sense of
            discomfort.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The four of them are likely racking their brains to remember the recent times they
            spent with Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&#39;re trying to recall if there were any gestures, facial expressions, or
            events that might have signalled something before and after the class trip, or if there were any signs that
            could have been interpreted as an SOS.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, things seemed the same as usual...right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a long silence, someone finally spoke up with words that conveyed a sense of
            normalcy. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe looked at his classmates, seeking their agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura also chimed in, sharing her thoughts in response to Watanabe&#39;s
            statement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, if it&#39;s true that she resigned from the student council, there may
            not have been any significant changes before or after. We even talked about the next special exam like usual
            today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki, who was likely observing Ichinose more closely than anyone else, did not
            contradict their opinions. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of Kanzaki&#39;s classmates tend to think in a self-contained manner and do not
            share information.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when the four of them gather and talk, doors that were once closed can be
            opened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However... It&#39;s not just recently, but ever since the deserted island test
            ended, she hasn&#39;t been herself. I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with Class A or anything like
            that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Amikura spoke hesitantly, she casually glanced in my direction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Is that so? I didn&#39;t notice at all... Really?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not just Watanabe, but also Kanzaki seemed to have been unaware of it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, now that you mention it, it may have been strange.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno said, showing a certain degree of understanding. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps she had been in a state of mind where she hadn&#39;t noticed it until
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the two boys didn&#39;t recall anything specific, the two girls seemed to have
            some recollection. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s no wonder Honami-chan is acting weird&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Amikura seems to have some idea of what&#39;s causing it. Please tell
            us.&rdquo; Watanabe asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, let&#39;s see... I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s just that Honami-chan
            didn&#39;t seem to be feeling well, but that&#39;s not really related to her resignation from the student
            council, is it?&rdquo; Amikura replied.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you assume that? Even if it&#39;s not related, if there was something
            bothering her, we need to know the cause as soon as possible. It could also have been affecting her
            decisions.&rdquo; Kanzaki said.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand what you mean, but... Ah, Ayanokoji-kun. What should I do?&rdquo;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura asked, seeking help in a panic. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Amikura, who understood things as one of Ichinose&#39;s closest friends, the
            others seemed clueless. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Himeno had a sudden realization when she saw the odd situation and Amikura
            seeking help from me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could it be that the cause is... you know, that?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s it, that&#39;s it, that thing!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they were just a bunch of clueless individuals, Himeno was the first to
            notice it among the three.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t know the details, but... yes, it does seem to make sense.&rdquo;
            Himeno replied.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please tell us, Himeno. What could be the factor that led to Ichinose&#39;s
            loss of her usual enthusiasm?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki asked, pushing the matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although it&#39;s not really appropriate to say this in front of the person,
            But Ayanokoji-kun is somehow responsible for Ichinose&#39;s lack of energy. right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite her hesitation, Amikura nods in agreement with Himeno&#39;s bold
            statement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you say...?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">To Kanzaki, this was completely unexpected news. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is shocked to hear that the reason for Ichinose&#39;s decline is related to
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Continuing the conversation in this half-hearted manner will only cause further
            confusion for Kanzaki and Watanabe.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;While it also pertains to Ichinose&#39;s private life, it&#39;s not good to
            withhold information in this situation. So, I will say &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; During the uninhabited island
            exam, I received a confession from Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon revealing this previously undisclosed information, Watanabe is more shocked than
            anyone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Confession? What? You mean She likes you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It just, it sort of happened.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that for real!? Ichinose likes Ayanokoji!? That&#39;s huge news...!&rdquo;
            said Watanabe</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that true!? I didn&#39;t know anything about that either&hellip;&rdquo;
            said Amikura</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura covers her mouth with both hands and is speechless.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about, Amikura!?&rdquo; said Watanabe</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to each person having different information, the inside of the karaoke box was in
            a state of panic.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that. I knew that Honami-chan liked Ayanokoji-kun, but I thought she was
            just shocked&hellip;&hellip; to find out that Karuizawa-san became his girlfriend.&rdquo; said Amikura,
            seemingly taken aback.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that even Amikura, a close friend, didn&#39;t know that Ichinose had
            expressed her feelings to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it was almost at the same time, That I found out about Karuizawa-san
            too. So, I thought there wasn&rsquo;t much difference.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe held his head in confusion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a mess... if that idiot Shibata found out, he&#39;ll be heartbroken...
            No, it&#39;s not just about Shibata&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Love-related, huh... I see.&rdquo; said Kanzaki, rubbing his forehead as if he
            had a headache.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, even if she was feeling down, the relevance of it seems to be
            low&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three of them tried to separate the issue from the student council incident,
            but...</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t know if Ichinose liked Ayanokoji from
            the beginning, but it seems like heartbreak can weigh heavily on a person, so maybe that&#39;s why she&#39;s
            been feeling down.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno quietly analyzed the situation. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did her resignation from the Student Council have something to do with it? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought about denying it, but with the current information, I couldn&#39;t prove
            that it was 100% wrong.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Ayanokoji were to break up with Karuizawa right now and start dating
            Ichinose, is there a possibility for improvement...?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki, who wanted to improve the class in any way possible, thought to
            himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s an absurd idea...right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While saying that, Amikura also had a nuance of &quot;What do you think?&quot; in her
            tone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t accept such a proposal from someone who is not
            involved.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s a good point.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Love and class battles must be separated, even if they affect each other
            indirectly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve shared this with you as information, but we need to approach it
            from a different direction now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are you so calm, Ayanokoji? You should realize that being liked by
            Ichinose is a really lucky thing!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t want to be talked to passionately about something like that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, the first priority is to change the minds of the four who have become
            unsettled. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to narrow down the reason why Ichinose resigned from the Student
            Council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there any sign of reluctance or negativity towards fighting Ryuuen&#39;s
            class?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their minds don&#39;t seem to switch gears quickly, and they don&#39;t answer
            immediately. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While drinking their drinks, Amikura raises her hand slightly after a short
            pause.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For now, it doesn&#39;t seem like anything has really changed. It feels like
            everyone is trying to win positively, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. We should keep doing our best, just like we have been.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. And we&#39;ve also heard some specific ways to fight back.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only Kanzaki did not speak, but perhaps his thoughts aligned with those of the three.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&#39;s what I thought, but he seemed to be thinking about what would happen
            next.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s why it can be seen as the flip side of pushing oneself too hard.
            She put on a bold front as to not put a burden on her classmates, even while being driven to quit the
            Student Council.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once she started thinking, she couldn&#39;t stop until she was trapped in a swamp of
            thoughts. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Kanzaki and the others had to think carefully.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had to delve a little deeper and explore laterally. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By giving each individual the power to think, they can revitalise the class.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand that you want to know why Ichinose quit the Student Council. I
            can also understand that you all are struggling with both positive and negative aspects. But what is your
            true intention? Do you not want Honami to strain herself, or do you want her to work for the benefit of the
            class if she&#39;s resigned from the student council? I would like to hear more about that.&quot; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said, conveying what I wanted to know to the four of them while taking a sip of
            oolong tea.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone stopped moving and exchanged glances, struggling to come up with a
            response.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could tell just by watching them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A prediction of what Ichinose&#39;s classmates who weren&#39;t here were
            thinking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There would probably be many people who were anxious about Ichinose&#39;s mental
            state.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Regardless of whether the leader falls or not, they would simply be genuinely worried
            about Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this was not the case for Kanzaki and Himeno.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me start by speaking. Of course, I expect Ichinose to have the leadership
            skills as a leader. The incident with the student council is irrelevant, and if the student council is a
            burden, I think she should quit without hesitation. What&#39;s important is whether she has the will to
            rebuild your class and aim for Class A. If she&#39;s lost that will, then it&#39;s a problem.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think she still has the same will as before. But if she&#39;s given up on
            Class A, then it&#39;s not something anyone can comment on, is it? In extreme cases, whether to aim for
            something or not is a personal freedom.&rdquo; said Watanabe.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s no wonder that Watanabe, who shows a side of himself that cares about his
            comrades, cannot force anyone to do something.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah...we can&#39;t force her, can we?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura feels the same way, and expresses her resignation that there is nothing that
            can be done. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When someone gives up, it is certainly cruel to continue forcing them to aim at Class
            A.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, it is not an act that is allowed as a leader. We need to report it to
            the class as soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least I hope that they won&#39;t hesitate to act. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that regard, there is no need to worry about Ichinose, who would hate to do
            anything that would cause trouble for her comrades.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is easy to imagine that she will contribute with the power she has for the sake of
            her comrades.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If she intends to quit, she will likely announce it early on. She understands
            that if she remains in the leadership position without actively aiming for Class A, she will not achieve
            positive outcomes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it&#39;s fine. After all, Ichinose hasn&#39;t said anything,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What I&#39;m afraid of is Ichinose&#39;s human nature, which comes from her
            kindness. I said something similar before, but what if she&#39;s pretending to be tough and covering up the
            truth that she gave up in a bluff? There&#39;s nothing more severe for the class than that.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the sake of her comrades, she won&#39;t show that she gave up for them on the
            surface. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Ichinose had really been broken, there is also the possibility that she might have
            concealed it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand what you mean somewhat, but&hellip;&hellip; isn&#39;t cooperation
            with Himeno necessary to prevent that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s not all. By gathering those who can give advice to Ichinose, the
            class can have another brain to rely on besides the leader. We need to prepare a second choice that
            doesn&#39;t leave everything to the leader alone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t that a bit like a betrayal?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The class led by Ichinose must be united. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, that&#39;s not it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Amikura&#39;s point of view, it&#39;s no wonder that Kanzaki&#39;s actions seem
            like a betrayal.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think we need to act now before it&#39;s too late. That&#39;s why we&#39;re
            making the necessary preparations.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. Although, as Ayanokoji pointed out, there are still many
            areas that need improvement.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Initially, Watanabe and Amikura hadn&#39;t given much thought to the situation, but
            now they had come to understand the details. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the discussion was far from clear and concise.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki also seemed to feel the awkward atmosphere, as there was no progress being
            made. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now, it seemed that questioning Ichinose&#39;s reasons for leaving the student
            council had come to a halt.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Continuing the discussion with no answers would be meaningless, given the limited
            information available.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kanzaki, can you tell me what you wanted to talk to me about?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Oh, yeah.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki replied, checking his phone for the time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The main reason I called you today was to introduce a new member. They had
            something come up this morning, so they&#39;re running a bit late, but they should be here
            soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, we shifted the conversation to lighter topics for about 20 minutes,
            putting aside the heavy discussion. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talked about our school trip and waited for the arrival of the new member.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me for intruding.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey there, Hamaguchi. I&#39;m glad you came.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I looked towards him, Hamaguchi Tetsuya from Ichinose&#39;s class
            appeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t expect to see Hamaguchi-kun here. Unexpected&hellip;&rdquo;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura&#39;s expression showed that she hadn&#39;t anticipated this, as she
            exchanged glances with Watanabe.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Ayanokoji-kun. I think the last time we met face to face was during the
            deserted island test, wasn&#39;t it?&rdquo; Hamaguchi said.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Probably. You were a big help back then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I vividly remembered how Hamaguchi had cordially welcomed me despite the need to
            conserve food.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It wasn&#39;t a big deal. So where should I sit?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For now...could you sit on this side, Hamaguchi?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki stood up and shifted over a bit to guide Hamaguchi to the seat next to
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So Hamaguchi was the one who was going to join us later?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. For now, he&#39;s the only one who can be considered a third
            member.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, if not for Watanabe and Amikura unexpectedly joining, they would only
            have been a group of three.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hamaguchi has already agreed to help us with the usual task.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That means he&#39;s the third official member, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was the person who could replace Ichinose, that Kanzaki and Himeno had in
            mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Watanabe and Amikura were probably unaware of the situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Kanzaki had allowed them to join this gathering, even though they were an
            unexpected addition. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he thought they were a hindrance, he could have simply declined and rescheduled
            for another day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&#39;ve reached the point where we need to start moving forward to make
            progress.&rdquo; Kanzaki said, his enthusiasm increasing a notch.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno nodded quietly in agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a minute, Hamaguchi-kun. Do you know what we&#39;re planning to
            do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ichinose-san&#39;s mental state is precarious. It&#39;s not a good idea to
            leave her alone like this. Kanzaki-kun pointed this out, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been concerned
            about since becoming a second-year student.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that Hamaguchi had already sensed Ichinose&#39;s anxiety.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously? You&#39;ve never shown any sign of it before.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s true. Our class didn&#39;t like that kind of atmosphere, so even if
            I tried to take action alone, no one would follow. Kanzaki-kun has been suffering because of this for a long
            time, and everyone has seen it.&rdquo; Hamaguchi said.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The details of what had happened were unknown to me, but the gestures and facial
            expressions of the classmates present here speak for themselves.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t want to remove Ichinose-san from the leader position. But I
            constantly think about becoming a teammate who can support her when she&#39;s in trouble. Kanzaki-kun&#39;s
            invitation came at a good time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;During the unanimous special exam, when I was alone and isolated, Hamaguchi
            privately showed concern for me in ways that others couldn&#39;t see. His actions and tone made it clear
            that he understood my situation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can tell a lot by looking at your surroundings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hamaguchi is dependable and also someone who can be relied upon.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may be similar to Yousuke&#39;s role and potential in Horikita&#39;s class.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Was it a good idea to tell me and Amikura such a secret?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s a gamble. It&#39;s important to proceed slowly behind the scenes, but
            with Ichinose&#39;s withdrawal from the student council, we can&#39;t afford to take too much time. If we
            can&#39;t bring in Watanabe and Amikura, we&#39;ll be stuck soon enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki seemed to have chosen to move forward with confidence after a chance
            encounter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Amikura&#39;s statements tend to lean towards Ichinose, she also has her own
            thoughts firmly in place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t mind that you trust me, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we promised not to tell anyone else, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both seem unable to hide their confusion, but at the same time, there&#39;s no sign
            that they would betray Kanzaki and his group.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t want you to immediately stand on our side. I just want you to
            change your one-sided reliance on Ichinose&#39;s judgement. Even if it&#39;s a slow process from now
            on.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you were trying to do something bad, it would be a different story, but I
            know that you&#39;re acting for the sake of the class. I can&#39;t say yes right away, but I&#39;ll consider
            it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe showed some understanding and answered with a slight loosening of his
            cheeks.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I still...can&#39;t say anything for sure. But, like Watanabe-kun said, I
            won&#39;t tell Honami-chan about this. That&#39;s all I can say for now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if you try to forcefully demand more here, you won&#39;t get a satisfying
            answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, what are Kanzaki and the others planning to do specifically from
            now on?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Specifically, huh? This is the first step to save the
            class&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki was about to continue his statement when the door suddenly burst open.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey hey! We&#39;re here to crash the party!&rdquo; exclaimed Ishizaki and
            Komiya as they entered the karaoke box without permission.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did someone in the room call for them? It didn&#39;t seem like it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The atmosphere was clearly different from before they arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you guys doing here on our day off? Include me too.&rdquo; Ishizaki
            said, oblivious to my presence until now, and turned his gaze towards me for the first time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, why is Ayanokoji here among this group?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are you guys here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you know, various things...right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishizaki avoided my gaze with a guilty look and turned to Komiya.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, we came to karaoke and saw you guys here. We thought it&#39;d be more
            fun to sing with a larger group than just the two of us.&rdquo; he answered, tapping on the glass door of
            the karaoke box.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&#39;re not friends, though, are we?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura confronted Ishizaki and Komiya directly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, well, you know...that&#39;s why we aimed to deepen our friendship with the
            best singing performance.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishizaki made an obvious excuse.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki had enough of this charade and revealed their true intentions. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ever since the announcement of the special exam, there have been daily
            unauthorized contacts from students in Ryuen&rsquo;s class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Here we go again&hellip;&hellip; Feels like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu,
            doesn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she didn&#39;t seem angry, Amikura crossed her arms with a look of
            exasperation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are you acting so outraged?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys barged in without permission into the Karaoke room of another group.
            Are you saying I&#39;m wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We just came to check on our peers, that&#39;s all. We just wanted to see what
            kind of songs you all were singing and have some fun if it looked enjoyable.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishizaki desperately tried to justify their actions in line with Komiya&#39;s
            statement, but no one believed him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Unfortunately, this gathering today isn&#39;t a study group.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;It seems that way.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishizaki noticed that there were no study materials on the table and scratched his
            head. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that for Ishizaki&#39;s group, who were at a significant disadvantage in
            terms of academic ability compared to Ichinose&#39;s class, their emphasis was on disrupting their opponents
            rather than studying seriously.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Amikura&#39;s comment of &quot;d&eacute;j&agrave; vu&quot; it seemed like this
            kind of thing had been happening repeatedly since the announcement to compete against Ichinose&#39;s
            class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, are you going to leave?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless we were actually studying, there was no benefit for them to continue staying
            in this situation that seemed to be nothing more than a group enjoying karaoke.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tch. Let&#39;s move on to the next place.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, in an overtly admitting tone, Ishizaki and the others left the room while
            clicking their tongues.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&#39;re an unbearable bunch. No, it&#39;s all because of Ryuuen, who gave
            them that order.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously. They only think about tripping up their opponents instead of
            studying seriously.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s like the end-of-term exams from last year all over
            again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that time, even though Ryuen won, he was engaged in a quite dangerous behaviour.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t think he will go too far this time, but we don&#39;t know what means
            Ryuen will use.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you being presented with a contract that has unreasonable
            demands?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, we&#39;re fine. We&#39;ve already prepared countermeasures. Of course, we
            won&#39;t let our guard down since we can&#39;t guarantee that there won&#39;t be any more trouble in the
            future.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki stood up, checked if Ishizaki and the others had really left, and then
            returned to his seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&#39;s get back to the main topic, now that we&#39;ve got rid of
            unnecessary distractions. The first step to saving the class is to quickly confirm what state Ichinose is
            in. We can&#39;t move forward or backward unless we get her back to her normal state.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed. We&#39;ve had a prolonged period of time where no one knows Ichinose&#39;s
            true state.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If only there were a way to perfectly grasp the current
            situation&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&#39;t we just need to support Honami-chan properly?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&#39;s different from what we&#39;ve been doing until now?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, if we just keep watching silently like we have been, we&#39;ll end up in
            the same situation we&#39;re in now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Kanzaki, don&#39;t blame us so harshly. Isn&#39;t this a place where we
            can freely express ourselves?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe interrupted Kanzaki&#39;s lecture with a slightly angry tone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We had the courage to offer our ideas, but if they&#39;re suppressed and
            crushed, then it will be difficult to offer the next opinion, won&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I also agree with Watanabe&#39;s opinion. Up until now, I&#39;ve held back
            on my own opinions, but it&#39;s not just Ichinose-san who&#39;s facing a big problem. I thought that
            Kanzaki-kun&#39;s strong tone of voice was also one of the reasons.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In defence of Watanabe, Hamaguchi calmly expressed his criticism of Kanzaki.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I appreciate Kanzaki-kun&#39;s efforts for the class, but if it goes in the
            wrong direction, it&#39;s meaningless, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although they were still a small group, each member had their own will. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even among those who blindly believed in Ichinose, there were students who had
            doubts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Hamaguchi and Watanabe didn&#39;t feel pressured to speak out in a heavy
            atmosphere. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&#39;s why it was important to have Kanzaki, who would take the initiative to
            step forward, which made it easier to speak freely.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&#39;s not a bad idea to support and be there for each other. I
            don&#39;t think Ichinose-san will easily answer our questions if we try to force her, so it&#39;s important
            to observe and determine things naturally.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you saying we should take more time? But we&#39;re in a situation where
            time is running out. It&#39;s too late for that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I think it depends on how we approach the situation. We only know
            Ichinose-san as a leader, but Amikura-san is different. She has plenty of opportunities to hang out with her
            on both of their days off, doesn&#39;t she? That should increase our chances.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Having more opportunities is definitely an advantage. However...there might be
            some disadvantages too. Because Amikura-san and the others are often with Ichinose-san, she&rsquo;s more
            likely to be on guard and it&#39;s harder to get close to her.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Familiarity breeds contempt. Amikura couldn&#39;t just ask anything she
            wanted.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I see. I have an idea for that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno, who seemed least likely to speak up, was the first to raise her hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please tell us.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about a plan where Ayanokoji-kun checks on Ichinose-san&#39;s day off?
            And then, he can ask her some questions while he&#39;s at it. Other students from different classes
            wouldn&#39;t normally be trusted, but if it&#39;s someone you like, you&#39;ll let your guard down,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That might be a good idea. Ichinose-san wouldn&#39;t mind being invited by
            someone she likes, and as Himeno said, her guard might be down.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hamaguchi seems to know that Ichinose has feelings for me as a matter of
            course.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, as I said earlier, Ayanokoji is from a different class. That&#39;s the
            biggest concern.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you trust him, right? You invited him to such an important
            discussion.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno&#39;s sharp retort stopped Kanzaki in his tracks.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&#39;s have him look into the parts that we, as classmates, can&#39;t
            see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a minute. I understand what Himeno is saying, but doesn&#39;t Ayanokoji
            have a girlfriend? That&#39;s a problem, isn&#39;t it? Especially if it&#39;s Karuizawa.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honami-chan stands out, so if she&#39;s alone with a guy, rumours might start
            to spread. We need to get permission from Karuizawa-san at least. It&#39;s not like we&#39;re deceiving
            anyone... but, if it&#39;s a fact that Honami-chan likes Ayanokoji-kun, so isn&#39;t this more of a
            permission issue...?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They started bringing up my name and getting carried away on their own.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can we even do this without Honami-chan? I understand it&#39;s for the class,
            but it feels wrong to use someone&#39;s feelings like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura, who seems to be particularly close to Ichinose, voiced her
            dissatisfaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ichinose class has always revolved around Ichinose, for better or for
            worse.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&#39;re not doing this to prepare for the special exam on our own. This is
            just one of the actions we&#39;re taking for Ichinose. It would be strange to tell her that we&#39;re
            worried about her thoughts and feelings.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki tried to persuade Amikura, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be convinced.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I realized that Kanzaki-kun wants to change classes at the time of the
            unanimous special test. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing. But, doing things behind the scenes, like
            talking to Ayanokoji-kun or aligning with Himeno-san, isn&#39;t praiseworthy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a member of the Ichinose class, who values transparency, is it natural to think
            that way too?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you act with confidence, it&#39;s clear that opposition will arise.
            That&#39;s why the opposition is gaining strength, because it&#39;s not just me alone, but Himeno and
            Hamaguchi are also cooperating with me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even now, it is a fact that more than half are on Kanzaki&#39;s side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it were only Kanzaki alone, he would have to fight at a disadvantage of 1 to 4,
            but now it&#39;s effectively 3 to 2. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With allies, he can also expect help from reinforcements.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So we decided on a date with Ayanokoji-kun, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&#39;s what Himeno concluded, but still, Amikura&#39;s expression remained stern
            and unchanged.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Himeno-san, You seem to have no doubts, but do you have that much
            dissatisfaction with Honami-chan&#39;s way of doing things?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand Kanzaki-kun. He has been giving opinions by Honami-chan&#39;s
            side, and sometimes strongly advocating for his own opinion. But I have never heard such a thing from
            Himeno-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Himeno is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kanzaki tried to refute in place of her, but Hamaguchi stopped him with his
            hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t it meaningless if you don&#39;t speak out about such important
            matters yourself?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking around at everyone, Hamaguchi&#39;s ability to objectively judge the right
            thing is still significant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m dissatisfied... I don&#39;t like the stance of
            everyone holding hands and being friendly. It&#39;s not just recently, it&#39;s always been like that even
            before coming to this school. I don&#39;t really like making friends, and I feel like it&#39;s more
            comfortable to be alone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amikura, who had never known this about her, was surprised.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I&#39;m not good at expressing my opinion, and it&#39;s easier to just go
            along silently. So if I was invited to play, I just followed along quietly, and if everyone followed
            Ichinose-san, then I had to follow too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had accepted being swayed by her surroundings without expressing her own
            opinion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But deep down, I always thought that Ichinose&#39;s way might not be the only
            way to succeed in class A. But there was nothing I could do. I just followed along because everyone else
            did.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even now, it seems that she is not good at making eye contact with others, and Himeno
            continued to speak while looking at the monitor where the video is still playing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I found out that Kanzaki-kun is seriously trying to change the class. I
            found out that he doesn&#39;t want to give up graduating from Class A. So, I decided to bet on
            it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it&#39;s a choice between going with the flow and ending up in Class B or
            working hard to graduate from Class A. That&#39;s the decision you made.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing Himeno&#39;s thoughts, which she had never spoken of before, Watanabe
            was amazed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...I see. I understand how you feel, Himeno-san. I didn&#39;t know
            anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not your fault. I never spoke about it honestly before.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the same could be said for Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s hard to tell how much someone is speaking from their heart until they reveal
            it themselves.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Amikura seemed somewhat dissatisfied with the plan, she eventually gave in
            and showed her understanding.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Representing the class, I&#39;ll ask. From Ichinose, I want to know her
            thoughts on resigning from the student council and her future plans. Does she still think she can win? I
            want you to find out her true feelings.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After reaching a conclusion, Kanzaki lowered his head to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;ve gotten on board with this ship, and there&#39;s no reason to
            refuse&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with an unusual smile, Kanzaki thanked me and lowered his head.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But what about the issue with Karuizawa? What are you going to do about
            that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else to do. I&#39;ll just explain the situation and make
            her understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But even if you call it a situation, it&#39;s about other classes, isn&#39;t
            it? Will Karuizawa-san just accept to help without suspicion?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it was a sudden request, it was a good opportunity to try something I wanted
            to do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.3j2qqm3"><span class="c20">Part 2</span></h3>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Amikura&#39;s proposal, it was decided to enjoy karaoke for a little while, and
            I went to the restroom before that. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it was unexpected, the fact that Kanzaki and the others showed signs of
            growth in their discussion was a great harvest. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, All that remained was to invite Ichinose another day and confirm the reasons for
            her resignation from the student council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ideally, it would be preferable for Kanzaki and the others to handle this, but given
            the potential for class disruption, I would not recommend them to act rashly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They should maintain their role as allies who follow Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I don&#39;t regret taking on the task, the difficult part is simply conversing
            with Ichinose for this invitation. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the special exam and the student council&#39;s departure, Ichinose has had two
            major events happen in succession, and trying to lure her out could raise suspicion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would it be better to straightforwardly ask and confirm with her in person? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it&#39;s better to check Ichinose&#39;s mental state first and then decide what
            to do. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If asking her directly could lead to negative consequences, then it would be
            pointless.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Ayanokoji.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe hurriedly followed me into the men&#39;s restroom.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, I thought Watanabe needed to use the restroom, but it seemed that was not
            the case.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen...you&#39;re going to meet with Ichinose soon, right? Well, I have a
            favour to ask...it&#39;s something simple, I think.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&#39;s something easy, I don&#39;t mind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After finishing up in the restroom and washing hands, we returned to the
            hallway.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&#39;s probably something easy, but, well, maybe it&#39;s
            difficult...? Umm&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe&#39;s usually clear-cut way of speaking became hesitant. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he must have thought it wouldn&#39;t be good to be away for too long because
            he cut to the chase.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s, uh...about Amikura.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Amikura? Is there something you&#39;re worried about?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Amikura was the one who seemed most emotionally unstable during their earlier
            discussion, it&#39;s possible that Watanabe sensed something. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though it didn&#39;t seem like she needed immediate attention.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not that. Well, I mean, it is, but it&#39;s not just
            that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though his words were somewhat incoherent, I decided to listen to him for the time
            being.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Has she, uh...mentioned liking any boys recently? I mean, Ichinose should
            already know about it, right?...Can you try asking her? If it&#39;s not too much trouble.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I too am starting to understand a little bit about love, emotions, and actions
            related to them. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can understand why Watanabe stutters as he tries to convey his feelings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a crush on Amikura.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey hey hey! Don&#39;t say it so blatantly here!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s okay. There&#39;s no one here right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only sounds leaking out into the hallway are the BGM playing inside the store and
            the singing voice from the karaoke box. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s actually more of a problem for Watanabe to be flustered and yelling so
            loudly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even when the person you like is in the same group, you were calm. Especially
            during the school trip.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m not a child, so I don&#39;t show it so obviously in my
            attitude.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come to think of it, didn&#39;t Watanabe say he was shopping together with Amikura
            today? </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When that fact comes to light, things start to make sense.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could it be that you were trying to ask her out on a date today?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&#39;s the case, then Watanabe is quite the strategist.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Oh...well, I was aiming for something similar to that. I got up early and
            prepared myself. Then we met in the lobby. I was really nervous on the inside.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking back on that morning, Watanabe spoke with a bitter expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But once we started walking together, we couldn&#39;t really get the
            conversation going. We&#39;re usually good at talking to each other when there are a lot of people around,
            but suddenly the words wouldn&#39;t come out. It was kind of hellish until we got to Keyaki
            Mall.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was good up until they went out together, but things didn&#39;t go smoothly
            afterwards.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you dislike being alone with her?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t hate it. But I got frustrated with myself for not being able to
            talk well, and I kept thinking that it probably wasn&#39;t fun for Amikura to be with someone like me. And
            then I heard Kanzaki and Himeno walking and talking about meeting with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might have been a lifeline for Watanabe who had fallen into a difficult
            situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I asked them if we can come and hang out since we were in the same group
            during our school trip,&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps it was a decision to take the easy way out, but not to retreat
            completely.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so that&#39;s what happened.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would have been regrettable to lose that chance to be alone with her, but there is
            nothing more painful than a date that doesn&#39;t go well. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although, Amikura might not have even considered it a date.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was a bit scared when I realized an important conversation was about to
            start, but in hindsight, I&#39;m glad it happened. I feel like I understand Kanzaki&#39;s and Ichinose&#39;s
            perspectives now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given what I&#39;ve seen of Watanabe&#39;s personality thus far, if Kanzaki and the
            others had acted earlier, he might have been able to join their side like Hamaguchi. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are likely still students of that sort in Ichinose&#39;s class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So... it&#39;s about Amikura. Can you find out more about her for
            me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&#39;re going to meet Ichinose soon, right? I want you to casually bring it
            up and see if you can get any information.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&#39;s no guarantee that Ichinose is aware of Amikura&#39;s love life
            situation, let alone if she&#39;s willing to talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, she knows. If Amikura was interested in someone or dating someone, she
            would definitely know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe answered with confidence, though it&#39;s unclear where that confidence came
            from.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Like, the typical gossip among girls?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&#39;s it. I can&#39;t imagine Amikura being the type to date a guy
            without discussing it with someone first. If she didn&#39;t tell Ichinose, then I might have a
            chance.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So you want to confirm that there isn&#39;t a specific guy she likes
            yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe nodded with a sly smile.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well...actually, what I really want is for my name to come up in the
            conversation. But there&#39;s no sign of that happening, so I guess there&#39;s no helping it. If I
            don&#39;t have any rivals right now, then I just have to keep pushing forward.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I haven&#39;t been able to grasp any feelings about it myself, so I analyze that
            there&#39;s no possibility of leading. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, I&#39;m not sure how reliable self-analysis is when it comes to romance, but
            I&#39;m also grateful for the kindness shown during the school trip. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There may be some parts that are difficult to ask classmates for help with this kind
            of thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Above all, I appreciate Watanabe&#39;s positive attitude.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I can casually find out, I&#39;ll ask. But please don&#39;t have excessive
            expectations. It would be inconvenient for you if I intruded too much and made her cautious.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&#39;s totally fine.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watanabe was happy, with a slightly embarrassed yet delighted expression on his
            face.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was just after 4 p.m. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After being a good listener at the karaoke for a while, I finished my role and we
            parted ways. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I then sat alone on a bench on the second floor of Keyaki Mall.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had decided to stay regardless of whether the group ended early or late today.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With no particular purpose in mind, I thought about browsing the internet on my
            phone, but before I knew it, I received a message and a photo from Kei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a glance, I could see that she was happily snuggled up to Sato, making a peace
            sign. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that she planned to gather with her female friends in the dorm and chat
            until evening. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other members included Sato, Mori, Ishikura, and Maezono.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of Kei&#39;s strengths is that she can gather with her close friends like this,
            even if she can&#39;t spend time with me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When asked what time she would return, I hesitated for a moment, but replied that it
            would be after 8 pm. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I had told her that I could come back earlier, she might have cut short her time
            with her friends. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be better for her to enjoy spending time with her friends without being
            caught up in distractions on days like this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since there doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone else around, I don&#39;t have to worry
            about someone overhearing my phone call. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While occasionally observing students who appear in the distance, I took out my phone
            and called Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&#39;s no point in putting it off any longer, and if possible, I&#39;d like to
            make an appointment for tomorrow. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the phone rang for a while next to my ear, Ichinose did not answer the
            call.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is she spending time with someone and not noticing her phone, or is she intentionally
            not answering? </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did contacting Ichinose on the night nearing the end of the school trip ultimately
            lead to distortion? </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While pondering various thoughts, I looked at my call history and a call came
            back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hel-hello? Sorry, I couldn&#39;t answer the phone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first words of the nervous-sounding caller.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no apparent indication that she particularly disliked the call, based on
            her voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Were you busy?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no, I was just preparing dinner...This is an unusual call,
            huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realized that might be true as she told me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because I hardly had a few memories of calling Ichinose during her private time like
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Faint voices could be heard on the other end of the phone. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought she might be with someone, but upon closer listening, I realized it was the
            sound of a TV.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s a bit sudden, but can we meet tomorrow if you&#39;re
            free?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I directly stated the reason as if boldly entering the front.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me and you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do I sound like I&#39;m inviting someone other than you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no, it&#39;s not that...but...uh, the two of us...?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If it&#39;s possible, just the two of us.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I conveyed it plainly as this was not a moment to beat around the bush. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was no response from Ichinose, and a somewhat heavy silence lasted for
            a few seconds.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t have any plans...What&#39;s the reason?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Depending on that, Ichinose wouldn&#39;t necessarily be opposed to meeting. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In simpler terms, if it was a consultation or if I had some sort of problem, then she
            would likely be easy to meet with. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I couldn&#39;t reveal the part about being asked by Kanzaki and the others.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been asked to investigate without letting her know.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it possible for us to meet even if there&#39;s no business to
            discuss?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&#39;s... but being alone together&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just want to meet you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsu...!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But if it&#39;s mentally tough for you, it might be better not
            to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With full knowledge of the risks, I decided to take a step back and see where
            Ichinose&#39;s emotions were.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-wait... umm, no... it&#39;s okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she was not without suspicion, it seemed that there was no emotion that she
            particularly wanted to avoid.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure? I don&#39;t want to force you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m not forcing myself... I also want to meet
            Ayanokoji-kun&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Then, how about meeting at Keyaki Mall tomorrow at 10
            o&#39;clock?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&#39;t sure how long it would take, so it was best to keep her as long as
            possible.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-okay. At 10 o&#39;clock.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s settled then. If anything comes up, feel free to contact
            me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it was possible to have a longer conversation, I decided to avoid it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay... see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With those words, the awkward conversation ended and the call was
            disconnected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now, I had managed to make an appointment to meet with Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that was left was to find out more about her mental state tomorrow. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be ideal if I could also learn what she was thinking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps I should stop by a bookstore later. I still have plenty of time to spend
            alone today.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time I spend alone now, by choice, is different from when I had no friends.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a moment of bliss where I can come to notice things from a different point
            of view.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.4i7ojhp"><span class="c20">Part 4</span></h3>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After enjoying my time until nightfall, I stopped by the supermarket and bought a
            late dinner. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told Kei that I was heading home and left Keyaki Mall. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The temperature had dropped significantly, it was quite difficult to bear, having
            been in an environment with heating for so long. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The phone in my pocket vibrated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I read the message, Kei replied that she had just finished dinner with her
            friends and they had parted ways. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I responded that I was glad she had a good day and walked back to the dormitory on
            the less crowded path alone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the way, I noticed a female student standing still with her gaze fixed on the sky.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span

                title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&#39;t make out who it was in the dark, but I had a vague feeling of
            recognition. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I approached, her identity became clear. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were no other students around, only her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surprised to see you here. I thought you had already gone back.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno turned around upon hearing my voice. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Didn&#39;t you go back already?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you I was going shopping before heading home.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, I remember you saying something like that... but isn&#39;t it a little
            late for that now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like she had only half-listened to what was said. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it had been almost four hours since we had disbanded, so it was no use
            wondering about it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&#39;re heading back now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno asked, looking at the plastic bag from the supermarket. I nodded in
            agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What have you been doing all this time?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I... was just wandering around. Went to a variety store and even went to the
            front of a movie theatre for no reason.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like Himeno had enjoyed spending time alone in the same way as I
            did.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, would you like to walk back to the dorm together while we&#39;re
            at it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a little surprised by the uncharacteristic proposal from Himeno, but I
            couldn&#39;t think of a reason to refuse.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uuh, it gets cold at night.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shuddered as if she hadn&#39;t noticed until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, Kanzaki and the others asked if I wanted to hang out with them a
            little more after we disbanded.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought it was important to have a chance to talk with just classmates, but
            I declined.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be honest, I just wanted to avoid that environment a little. Oh, it&#39;s
            not like I want to leave the group or anything like that. I just didn&#39;t like doing things with a lot of
            people.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno seemed to be struggling with how to deal with a large group of people,
            although she was gradually getting used to it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I always thought it&#39;s calming to be alone, but before I knew it, it was
            nighttime.&rsquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so that&#39;s how it is.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But since I had more time alone, I ended up thinking a lot. Especially the
            words Ayanokoji-kun said to me really hit home, or rather, I felt like you hit a sore spot. It
            hurts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems like she was worried about the struggles she showed during karaoke.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I realized that I couldn&#39;t do anything that I had imagined myself doing.
            Unlike the others, who didn&#39;t realize that Ichinose-san was in danger, I had a bit of confidence in
            being able to notice things, and I thought I was doing something special by working with Kanzaki-kun. But
            now, I feel like I&#39;ve been brought down a notch, like I&#39;ve had the rug pulled out from under
            me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry about that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not like you need to apologize or anything. Actually, what
            Ayanokoji-kun said was right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno let out a wry smile and exhaled a white breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought it would be easier to do something amazing... but taking action is
            tough, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone feels that way. Even Ichinose and I. But it&#39;s not helpful to get
            too hung up on it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&#39;t want to console her, but I gently conveyed that it would be troublesome
            if she got too deeply caught up in her worries.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m in the middle of searching for the path forward, but I&#39;m at a loss
            as to whether I should continue taking action with Kanzaki-kun and Hamaguchi-kun to improve the
            situation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not a bad thing to be unsure. However, standing still won&#39;t solve
            the problem.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s true. I thought we were starting to take action to save the class,
            but now it seems like the invisible gears are starting to slip. That&#39;s the feeling I get.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The invisible gears are starting to slip... If you try to do something unprecedented,
            it&#39;s natural for anxiety to creep in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand how you feel. But even if you were asked if the gears had been
            turning smoothly up until now, could you honestly answer yes?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&#39;s true.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sound class management has been in place, but the results have not followed.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This indicates that the gears were not functioning properly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is a fact that a transformation is about to take place in your
            class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether it&#39;s fortunate or unfortunate, I still don&#39;t know the answer to where
            it will lead. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only Kanzaki&#39;s presence, but also Ichinose, who resigned from the student
            council.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I intend to manage various things, the future is uncertain and opaque.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there are two outcomes: life or death. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it&#39;s a choice of whether Ichinose&#39;s class will be saved or
            not. Yet the path of that process is shrouded in impenetrable fog. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">March, the end of the second year, will soon arrive.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By that time, Himeno will probably be able to see the results.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-kun, do you think there is still a possibility for our class to
            become Class A if we change?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you want an objective opinion?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, if possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;If I can answer that question... it&#39;s a conditional yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh...I thought you were going to say it&#39;s impossible. But
            conditional?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It&#39;s not easy for second-year students to reach Class A just by changing
            their mindset. In fact, the gap between Ichinose&#39;s class and Class A is becoming more serious. To bridge
            that gap, everyone in the class must have the appropriate pain and determination. Otherwise, they won&#39;t
            be able to reach it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pain and determination...what do you mean specifically?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t answer that right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&#39;t answer that, huh? I didn&#39;t expect such a response to come
            back. Do you think I would say that you didn&#39;t think about it at all, or that you just said it
            randomly?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Normally, that&#39;s what people would think.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because it&#39;s like a story of another class&#39;s troubles, or their
            anguish. The more we suffer, the more Ayanokoji-kun&#39;s class benefits relatively. Isn&#39;t that
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yet you sympathise with us and cooperate with us. Why is that?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Before being enemies or allies, it&#39;s because I strongly feel like I want
            to see where Ichinose&#39;s class will end up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where will we end up...? It sounds like Ayanokoji-kun can see into the future
            or something.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one can see the future, but they can predict and prepare for it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s why I plan to lend a hand when you&#39;re in trouble for a while.
            If it&#39;s okay with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sure Kanzaki-kun would be happy. I feel really reassured
            too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno, who perceived it favourably, made a small victory pose with both arms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope you can always look that confident.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Ah, suddenly I feel embarrassed&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying that, she put both hands into her pockets and averted her gaze.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.2xcytpi"><span class="c20">Part 5</span></h3>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While walking back to the dormitory with Himeno, We found Kei sitting on a bench and
            playing with her cellphone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, see you later.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Himeno, who quickly read the atmosphere, moved away from my side and walked briskly.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slightly bowed to Kei sitting on the bench, then continued walking back to the
            dormitory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing here? Weren&#39;t you supposed to go back to your
            room?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What am I doing? What does it look like I&#39;m doing?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Waiting for someone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Correct. Now, who do you think I&#39;m waiting for? 1. Ike-kun, 2. Minami-kun,
            3. Kiyotaka.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said, holding up one finger at a time as she presented her quiz.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s an extremely difficult question. While the possibility of 1 seems
            high&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you get it wrong, there&#39;ll be a punishment game.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shouldn&#39;t I hear the contents of the punishment game before
            answering?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. How about writing &#39;Love from Kei-chan&#39; on your
            forehead with a marker and going to school like that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, I&#39;ll choose number 3.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you don&#39;t want to play the punishment game that badly?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While a little angry, she stood up from the bench and lined up next to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, that girl earlier was Himeno-san, right? Why was she walking with
            Kiyotaka?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiled, but pressed me with a strong pressure to explain the reason.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you I was going to meet Kanzaki. Himeno was one of the people
            there.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? But Kanzaki-kun wasn&#39;t there, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We disbanded once. And then, as we were leaving, I happened to meet Himeno and
            we just had a casual chat.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Hmm? Well, since I&rsquo;m your girlfriend, I&#39;ll trust your words for
            now, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she said that, it seemed that she still had some doubts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looked like you were getting along well, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s wrong. In the darkness, you can&#39;t see that far.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh... y-yeah, that&#39;s true. But there was just something that I
            couldn&#39;t quite put into words! But never mind that now!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person next to me wrapped her arm around mine, as if to assert that the seat is
            hers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&#39;s talk about something fun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then how about we go to Keyaki Mall together tomorrow? Christmas is coming up
            soon, after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She invited me with a sly smile. &quot;You know what I&#39;m trying to say,
            right?&quot; That was her expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because Sudou&#39;s confession failed, right? So it&#39;s for a Christmas
            present, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Correct. Surprising me with a present is good, but it&#39;s not a bad idea to
            go shopping with your boyfriend for something you really want, either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s definitely better to make her happy than to worry about it on my own, so
            it&#39;s helpful for me too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to live up to your expectations, but tomorrow is a little difficult.
            Can we do it next week?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Did you accidentally schedule something else again?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had informed Kei in advance about meeting Kanzaki and the others today. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei doesn&#39;t have a connection with Kanzaki and the others and doesn&#39;t
            understand my relationship with them well, so she was a little curious, but didn&#39;t pay much attention to
            it...</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s the case.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can&#39;t you make even a little time? What are you doing
            tomorrow?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;ll be spending time with Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s easy to deceive her by not telling her, but just like when I talked about
            Kanzaki and the others, the drawbacks of keeping it a secret are too big.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose&#39;s existence is already noticeable enough, and if I&#39;m with her,
            rumours of Restlessness will spread. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, Kei has many friends, and those students will be her eyes and
            ears.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m meeting Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;......With Ichinose-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei immediately froze, her reaction was markedly different when I mentioned meeting
            Ichinose, compared to when I told her I was meeting Kanzaki.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who else is there? Like Kanzaki-kun or Himeno-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one else for now. Only Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? I don&#39;t really understand. Meeting with
            a girl alone on a holiday?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was clear that she was in a bad mood, but it was understandable. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if the situation was reversed, a normal guy would have shown a similar
            reaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glanced at Kei&#39;s expression and she met my gaze with a glare.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Normally, you explain the reasons and talk about it properly. Like,
            &#39;We&#39;re meeting alone, but don&#39;t get the wrong idea. There&#39;s a reason for this.&#39; You
            shouldn&#39;t make your girlfriend feel anxious like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s true. There are several reasons why I&#39;m meeting with Ichinose,
            but one of them is that Kanzaki and the others asked me to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;......Kanzaki-kun and the others asked you? Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Kanzaki&#39;s name being mentioned, Kei felt slightly relieved.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It hasn&#39;t been announced publicly yet, but Ichinose resigned from the
            student council. There&#39;s confusion because of that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a minute. Really? I don&#39;t really understand why though.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Isn&#39;t it strange? Kanzaki and the others want to know the truth. Being a
            part of the student council has a positive effect on the class as well. With the class falling to D now,
            it&#39;s understandable that classmates would be upset about Ichinose leaving the student council, which
            could mean losing even more points.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with this brief explanation, Kei could somehow sense the anxiety that Kanzaki
            and the others were feeling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Kanzaki and the others are afraid to ask Ichinose directly. Hearing from
            Ichinose herself that she&#39;s given up on pursuing A-class would be unbearable for them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does that mean that Kiyotaka will be the one to find out the reason
            instead?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand the situation, but...why is Kiyotaka getting involved with
            Ichinose&#39;s class? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to just leave it alone? If we help them, they might become
            our rivals again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a reasonable question to ask, but this was not a story that could be shared
            with Horikita and the others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is a reason why we are sending salt to our enemies. However, I can&#39;t
            tell you about it yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&#39;t tell me ......? You think I would ever tell
            anyone?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s not it. I know that you can keep a secret. I just don&#39;t want to
            share what I&#39;m planning with anyone right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei&#39;s expression tightened a bit as she spoke in a rigid, dismissive
            manner.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was natural that Kei couldn&#39;t simply accept it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know Kiyotaka is thinking about a lot of things. I understand that he must
            be doing something to help the class that I don&#39;t know about, and that he&#39;s trying to get
            information from Ichinose-san because of Kanzaki-kun&#39;s request. But...I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s
            uncomfortable for me that you are meeting with a girl on a holiday&hellip; there must be other ways, like
            meeting at school or only during lunch break, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a pout, Kei turned her head to the side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be easy to say that she was the only one who mattered and apologise, but in
            love, it was important to reassure the other person. I had learned that already.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what would happen if it were the opposite? </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had an idea of the answer, but I couldn&#39;t say I understood it until I actually
            reached it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you want to get in my way then? Just go ahead and disrupt us when I&#39;m
            with Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W&mdash;why would I do that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You wouldn&#39;t, right? There&#39;s no benefit in doing something like that.
            Then, let&#39;s end this discussion here. We&#39;ll go buy Christmas presents together next week, and there
            shouldn&#39;t be any problems.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just by omitting a few consoling words, a sudden heaviness descended upon the
            atmosphere. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The joyful image of Kei eagerly awaiting my arrival under the chilly skies had
            vanished.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, it&#39;s fine. Kiyotaka has his own plans, I have no right to say
            anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only her expression, but her emotions too seemed to have escaped somewhere far
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;ll stop by the convenience store on the way back. You can go
            ahead.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, she ran towards the convenience store without looking back. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, her pace was quick yet slow, and I could tell from her back that she was
            expecting me to chase after her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could just quickly catch up to her and apologize, and think of a way to meet
            Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would improve her mood, just like before.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I decided to break my gaze away from her back and head back to the
            dormitory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By doing this, the gap between us would deepen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be a good opportunity to experience how Kei would react and what attitude
            she would show, and how I would feel and act in response.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
