        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While preparing for the second term&rsquo;s final special test, Horikita has a
                        problem that she must solve.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The work to take over after Student Council President Nagumo resigns.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she decided to start working on it the very next day after being
                        left
                        with the role of the new Student Council President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person in question was discussing some things with her classmates.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Student Council is also something she needs to handle, but she has to think
                        about
                        the countermeasures to the new special test too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;ll make me repay it in double if I ignore her now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d like to avoid that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After around 10 minutes of thinking about that, I approached her without
                        bothering to
                        apologize.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should we go somewhere else now, then?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is the strategy meeting over already?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I discussed things thoroughly with Hirata-kun and the others yesterday. I
                        only
                        asked for a progress report today. Fortunately, most of our classmates are very motivated.
                        They&rsquo;re
                        being positive even though they hate studying. The rise of Sudou, who was at the bottom in
                        grades, the
                        psychological pressure of Sakura-san dropping out, and the point difference and confrontation
                        with A Class,
                        who are now in the shooting range for us. It&rsquo;s all proof that things are headed in a
                        better
                        way.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just for a moment, Horikita looked to be checking for my reaction when she said
                        out
                        loud the name of Sakura Airi.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you still feel bad?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not callous enough to not feel bad. Even if it&rsquo;s
                        true.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good. There&rsquo;s nothing for you to be ashamed
                        of.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita should be getting a better understanding as time passes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I started walking, Horikita followed me while looking slightly
                        disconcerted.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I felt very reassured when I heard from Nagumo-senpai that you would be
                        cooperating with me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course he said that. I just want you to understand that I didn&rsquo;t
                        want
                        this in the least.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things get hard later when there are disagreements because of the problem of a
                        difference in motivation.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, I&rsquo;m sure she already understands all this without me saying
                        it.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c8">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s obvious. You didn&rsquo;t even tell me that he told you to
                        help
                        me out. You were just going to feign </span><span class="c8 c19">ignorance</span><span
                        class="c8 c28">3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;if I never spoke out to you, right?&rdquo;</span>

        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that she already knew about it and was trying to incite me on
                        purpose.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe you should have just let it go, considering that it&rsquo;s
                        me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My attempts to find a way out of the situation were dashed by the immediate
                        response.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Recently, the way she&#39;s been dealing with me has been getting more and more
                        rough, in a good way, or even in a bad way too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, though. I&rsquo;m not going to bother gathering all the
                        Student Council members together. I found some candidates throughout yesterday, so I&rsquo;m
                        going to make
                        the decision today. The Student Council is important too, but I need to focus on the Special
                        Test right
                        now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least she wants to solve this quickly, so that&rsquo;s a relief.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One person from year-two and one person from year-one,
                        right?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I also received more concrete terms when I met with Student Council
                        President Nagumo again. They need to have at least a B in Academic Ability in the
                        OAA.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Academic Ability, huh? Well, it&rsquo;s an understandable condition to let
                        someone into the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since social contributions do not seem to be more important, a wide range of
                        selections should be possible.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that you mention it, a certain someone had just gotten up to B in
                        Academic

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m suddenly getting a stomach ache. Let&rsquo;s go
                        back.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even make jokes?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried that you&rsquo;re being serious.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I need to fill the vacancy of a year-two student after Ichinose-san left.
                        With
                        someone other than you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. So, you have made your decision, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. The essential condition to become a member of the Student Council is
                        to
                        not participate in club activities.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Academic Ability B or above, and the rest is up to me to decide with my
                        own
                        judgement.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With an unmotivated group of randomly assembled members, the Student
                        Council&#39;s
                        activities would be in jeopardy.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I intend to give this my all. If just being in the Student Council gives
                        you a
                        small advantage, I don&rsquo;t want to bring in anyone from a rival like A Class.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she wants to protect any advantage she can get, no matter how
                        small.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So the ideal thing is to bring people in from your own
                        class.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&#39;s the way it is. It&#39;s not against the
                        rules
                        to have an ulterior motive apparent in appointing someone from your own class.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think I&rsquo;m starting to see the reason we&rsquo;ve been waiting here
                        instead of
                        walking ahead.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you want to talk to me about, Horikita-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person who came out of the classroom and spoke to us was Kushida.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Horikita glanced at me as if to say &ldquo;how about
                        that?&rdquo;.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Certainly, Kushida is a student who has a very high external reputation,
                        including
                        for her visuals.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her Academic Ability is definitely above B as well, and her specs are equal to
                        those
                        of the Student Council&rsquo;s members.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s all for people looking in from the outside, though. Kushida and
                        Horikita
                        would be like water and oil.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, I needed your help with something, Kushida-san.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dangerous act of pouring a large amount of water into a pot filled with
                        oil.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is still off-record, but Ichinose-san has decided to resign from the
                        student council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I see. Does that mean there was some kind of problem?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was because of personal reasons.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida hasn&rsquo;t come to grips with the situation yet, but the oil is
                        starting to
                        heat up.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not at high temperature just yet, though.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was a vacancy left behind after a Student Council member resigned,
                        so
                        I&rsquo;d like you to fill that place.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That should be clear enough to convey the message.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The oil that&rsquo;s heating up started crackling and bouncing the water

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is Student Council President Nagumo still continuing as
                        President?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m the only year-two remaining in the Student Council. I was
                        automatically moved up.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words&hellip; You&rsquo;re going to become the Student Council
                        President, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the plan, as long as nothing troubling happens after
                        this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida seems a bit surprised at the sudden mention of the matter of the Student
                        Council President, but that&rsquo;s probably not the most important point. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was already a given that Ichinose or Horikita would become the Student Council
                        President.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida asked about the most important matter for her.</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s smiling and laughing, but we know the truth.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can feel the intent behind her demeanour : &ldquo;Like I would ever work under
                        you.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida is saying that it&rsquo;s a waste of time to talk about something she
                        wouldn&rsquo;t accept.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s quite the thing to convey this while smiling.</span></p>

                        she&rsquo;s
                        claiming the reason for her refusal is her lack of ability.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. You have a high evaluation in the OAA, and most of

                        quickly
                        open their hearts to you as well. Your ability is precisely why I scouted you.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I&rsquo;m sure this doesn&rsquo;t make much of a difference for

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I appreciate your consideration, but it would be quite difficult after

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida is clearly displeased, but I should be the only one who can see that.
                        Maybe
                        Horikita can see it too.</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clearly not thinking about Kushida, Amasawa frankly spoke so.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at the two, Horikita should also be able to understand that Amasawa knows

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, only a little while. Since Horikita-senpai said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I only tell the truth, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about lying that you came to see Kushida-san? No, there&rsquo;s no

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With one doubt, all other things come into question.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon now, don&rsquo;t worry about the tiny details. Please continue

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Right. Leaving Amasawa-san aside for a moment, may I get an

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita moved on to trying to convince Kushida and turn this bad situation
                        around.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve already given you the answer. I won&rsquo;t accept

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No matter what?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry. I can&rsquo;t meet your expectations. I can&rsquo;t work in
                        the-&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just enter the Student Council instead of saying stuff
                        like that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Breaking her promise of not bothering them, Amasawa spoke out after only 10
                        seconds.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather, knowing that Kushida cannot attack her, Amasawa is getting excited right
                        behind Kushida, pestering and touching her all over.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On top of all that, she started playing with her cheeks using her index
                        finger.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful, Kushida-senpai, and you have a nice physique
                        too.
                        Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a wise decision?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s repeatedly whispering in Kushida&rsquo;s ears like a little devil
                        persuading&hellip; no, agitating her. But none of her expressions are honest compliments.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm. If we&rsquo;re going to continue talking, maybe we should go
                        somewhere
                        else?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if she continues to refuse, it seems stressful for Kushida to be in front of
                        the
                        public.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must feel that it would be difficult to continue the conversation any further
                        like this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, she could cut the conversation off and leave, but this version of
                        Kushida
                        cannot do that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-kun, how about you chat with Amasawa-san for a
                        while?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh~? Are you really pawning me off on him like that, senpai?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to lend Ayanokoji-kun to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita crossed her arms, telling Amasawa to be grateful that she is not just
                        turning her away.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to be with you and Kushida-senpai, not just with
                        Ayanokoji-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s just trying to have fun.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides, if you turn me away, I may have to talk about a bunch of secrets
                        that
                        I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these threats that may or may not be true, it is no longer desirable to
                        force
                        her away.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Fine. Let&rsquo;s just go somewhere else like Kushida-san
                        wanted.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita tried to surround herself with a large crowd of people as a weapon, but
                        the
                        situation got only worse because of Amasawa, who was subjecting us to merciless chatter.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judging that she cannot get a good reply like this, Horikita decided to change
                        location.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c20">Part 1</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita led Kushida up the stairs and moved to the special building.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be anyone else here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita asked for confirmation from Kushida that this was a good spot.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida, who probably didn&rsquo;t even want to follow Horikita here, breathed a
                        deep, heavy sigh.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This place seems safe, huh? We&rsquo;ll know right away if anyone
                        approaches,
                        yep, yep.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How long are you going to follow us around, Amasawa-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wanna know if Kushida-senpai will end up entering the Student
                        Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I guess she has no intentions of returning until she finds out the
                        results.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah~ So annoying. Horikita is annoying too, but you&rsquo;re three times
                        more
                        annoying.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Kushida is no longer in public mode, and her true face appeared
                        without
                        warning.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She really doesn&rsquo;t like you, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s quite the thing to be disliked three times more than Horikita, whom
                        Kushida should hate the most here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With cold eyes directed at her, Amasawa smiled the biggest smile of the
                        day.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahaha, I love seeing that face so much.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without hesitation, Amasawa clapped her hands together with delight as if
                        it&rsquo;s
                        finally time to have some fun.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great that you can expose your true self to more people now.
                        Are
                        you not afraid of me now that you&rsquo;re allying with Ayanokoji-senpai and
                        Horikita-senpai?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re trying to mess with me or something,
                        but
                        why don&rsquo;t you stop wasting your time?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop. I want to give you some more trouble,
                        Kushida-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amasawa decided to stay in the school, but does she intend on taking pleasure in
                        making fun of Kushida? Was this the reason for her visit to Kushida, after all?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it true that you&rsquo;re the type of person who thinks they&rsquo;ll
                        never
                        be expelled from the school?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Is there anyone here who can expel me? I&rsquo;d like to see them, if
                        there are any.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop it already. Especially you, Amasawa-san. You&rsquo;re taking it too
                        far.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s true that Amasawa is pushing her unpleasant side forward to engage
                        Kushida
                        today. I don&rsquo;t want to be involved in the selection of Student Council members for too
                        long
                        either.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a hindrance for Horikita too if you take this further. Stop
                        it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I lightly cautioned Amasawa, and&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll be a good girl then, Ayanokoji-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She held her hands up to tell Kushida that she won&rsquo;t do any more
                        teasing.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kushida-san. Just ignore her&hellip; So, can&rsquo;t I have you join the
                        Student Council?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No matter what?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No matter what. Can I leave?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked at Kushida, who was about to leave the scene, and decided to move a
                        little.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Horikita. Shouldn&rsquo;t you give Kushida a clearer
                        presentation?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...A clearer presentation?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certain that Kushida can benefit from entering the Student
                        Council,
                        right? But at the same time, it&rsquo;ll benefit you too. It&rsquo;s reasonable that she would
                        be a little
                        displeased about that. Don&rsquo;t you think so too, Kushida?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida glared at me for a moment, then averted her gaze.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s naive of you to ask me to do this for free.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking advantage of my guidance, Kushida threw such words at Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wonder if you would consider it under certain conditions, then?
                        I&rsquo;ll
                        refuse if you want me to drop out like before, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s what Kushida would want, but of course, I can&rsquo;t
                        say
                        that it&rsquo;s realistic.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of condition would make Kushida join the Student Council?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you really want me to lend you my aid, then I want you to get on your
                        knees.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Get on my knees?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. If you show me that you really need me, I&rsquo;ll
                        enter
                        the Student Council for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Promising to join the Student Council, Kushida of course knew that Horikita would
                        never get on her knees for something like this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita is not as proud as Kushida, but She has a lot of pride too, even if not
                        as
                        much as Kushida.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it was for the sake of her class, she would never get down on her knees
                        in
                        this situation.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Kneeling down before you, that&rsquo;s your condition, huh? I
                        understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After muttering so, Horikita sat down on the cold floor on her knees.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Is this a joke?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I kneel before you, you&rsquo;ll join the Student Council. You promised
                        just now, right? Both Ayanokoji-kun and Amasawa-san saw it. If you want to take it back,
                        it&rsquo;s now or
                        never.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita wanted to bring her in even if she had to kneel down to her. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Facing this, Kushida was unusually at a loss for words.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bluffing, right? You would never kneel down before
                        me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I get why you think that, but I don&rsquo;t hate Kushida-san as much as
                        you
                        think I do. If kneeling down once will be a plus for my class, then it&rsquo;s worth
                        it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking up with serious eyes from below, Horikita earnestly replied so. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amasawa looked like she was having a lot of fun watching the situation
                        unfold.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t be able to kneel down. No way.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conclusion Kushida came to after some hesitation was that Horikita
                        &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; do it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to kneel down and have you enter the Student
                        Council, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying so, Horikita slowly reached out her arms to touch the floor, but she
                        stopped just before her hands were down.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, she stopped moving for a few seconds.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s the matter, Horikita-san? Weren&rsquo;t you going to
                        kneel
                        down?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking that Horikita couldn&rsquo;t bear the humiliation and stopped moving,
                        Kushida joyfully said so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say one thing first. Will you really be satisfied with
                        such
                        a trivial thing?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All I have to do is bow my head down, and you&rsquo;ll start working under
                        me.
                        No matter how you think about it, I&rsquo;m the one with the better end of the
                        deal.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida will be able to burn the image of Horikita kneeling down into her
                        eyes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But at the same time, she will have to support Horikita as she works above her
                        and
                        manages the Student Council. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t say that it would be a cheap exchange.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know that you hate me. I understand that you want me to kneel down. But,
                        I
                        think you&#39;d get more pleasure from forcing me to kneel down, rather than me doing it by my
                        own volition.
                        Right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is Horikita&rsquo;s tactic.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita definitely doesn&rsquo;t want to kneel down before Kushida.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Kushida was right. However, Horikita strangely doesn&rsquo;t seem
                        to
                        be afraid of getting down on her knees here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. If you don&rsquo;t mind kneeling before me, why
                        don&rsquo;t you just do it? Why don&rsquo;t you leave aside things like joy and pleasure, and
                        just bow your
                        head to pull me in?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida, on the other hand, is not easily convinced. She wouldn&rsquo;t join the
                        Student Council without a condition in the first place, so it&rsquo;s only natural that she
                        would pursue
                        that point.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I am hesitant to kneel down, it&rsquo;s only because I know that you
                        will
                        regret it. If I bow my head here, you&rsquo;re going to join the Student Council whether you
                        like it or not.
                        I don&rsquo;t want you to become a member with such low motivation.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she&rsquo;s going to join the Student Council, Horikita wants to make full use
                        of
                        Kushida Kikyou&rsquo;s abilities. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Horikita needs Kushida to want to join the Student Council
                        herself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be hard for you to make me bow down to you if we are distanced
                        from each other, but whether you like it or not, you&rsquo;ll have more chances to get in
                        contact with me if
                        you join the Student Council. If that happens, I&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to rely on you
                        more.
                        I&rsquo;ll have to bow down and ask you for help more than once or twice then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita is telling Kushida to create a situation where Horikita will bow down on
                        her
                        own accord instead of being forced to do so. This provocative remark seemed to have affected
                        Kushida more
                        than she had expected.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t change the fact that I&rsquo;ll be working under you,
                        though.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem to think that the Student Council President is above the others,
                        but
                        you&rsquo;re wrong. It&rsquo;s up to each person to decide their real position. It&rsquo;s just
                        a matter of
                        building a relationship where the Vice President has more power than the Student Council
                        President,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita is cornering Kushida from her low position by removing the obstacles in
                        her
                        way.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll instantly become Vice President, and you&rsquo;ll hold enough
                        authority to lead me around by the nose. That&rsquo;s plenty to fulfill your need for social
                        approval and
                        self-esteem, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since She has already dissected Kushida, Horikita knows what she needs and wants.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again, it&rsquo;s clear from that point of view that Kushida is a good fit
                        for
                        the Student Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you like it or not for now, does it?
                        That&rsquo;s a
                        trivial matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida&rsquo;s expression was grim, but she turned away from Horikita who was
                        ready
                        to bow down at any moment.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My position will get stronger if I enter the Student Council. That
                        doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s not interesting to have it offered in
                        exchange for something.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to make me fall for your smooth talk, but I intend on
                        using you just as much as you&rsquo;ll use me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita tried to pull back her arms with a smile, but&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, you know, Horikita-san. I still want to see you bowing down
                        here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida turned back and said so with a broad smile.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to make me bow down in the true sense then,
                        though?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have another chance to do that.
                        Just bow down for today, okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things have been splendidly going at Horikita&rsquo;s pace up until now, but she
                        made
                        a miscalculation at the last moment. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida cheered up and revealed more of her bad-natured personality, and turned
                        the
                        tables on Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well? Are you going to stop? I won&rsquo;t join the Student Council if you
                        do.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noticing that she has the upper hand, Kushida continued to put more pressure onto
                        Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita is at a disadvantage here, trying to get Kushida to join the Student
                        Council
                        even though she doesn&rsquo;t want to.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Ayanokoji-kun. Amasawa-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, but could you step away for a bit?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clearly in a foul mood, Horikita ordered us to get out of sight. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was not going to let more than one person see the humiliation of her kneeling
                        down. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pulled Amasawa by the arm, and left the scene.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita successfully completed her objective of having Kushida enter the Student
                        Council of her own volition, She had to pay the price, however.</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c20">Part 2</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I wish I could have seen you bowing down to Kushida-senpai
                        too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it out loud. It was a fatal mistake.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita shook with anger as she held her head and recalled what had happened a
                        few
                        minutes ago.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who brought it up, but Kushida really took advantage
                        of
                        you, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I underestimated her need for approval.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amasawa and I saw Kushida leave with a very happy expression on her face.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You forced her to join by bowing down.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Still, Kushida replied with a yes in the end, and that&rsquo;s her own
                        decision. She didn&rsquo;t have to do that if she didn&rsquo;t want to. You get that too,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impressive how well you read her.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida&rsquo;s public face smiles at everyone without distinction, but, just as
                        Horikita says, Kushida has a strong sense of ego behind the scenes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that situation, Kushida could show her true colours without being shy about
                        it.
                        Kushida could have rejected the offer after seeing Horikita bow down, but the reason why she
                        agreed in the
                        end was that she actually saw the merit in joining the Student Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s going to hate working under me, but that&rsquo;s not
                        the
                        important thing. Her cohesive power will certainly be increased by entering the Student Council.
                        She was
                        chased into the corner of the class once, but this should be a big support for the sake of her
                        revenge.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You intend on using her as much as you can, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m the one who chose to let her remain here. I have to
                        make
                        sure she gives the results that will convince our classmates. She even made me bow down,
                        so.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she is bothered by that after all, but that was her own strategic
                        mistake, so there&rsquo;s no helping it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she hadn&rsquo;t bowed down then, Kushida probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gone
                        along
                        with her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You should have used another tactic to fight her.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop talking about that already. I&rsquo;ll put that to good use for the
                        next
                        time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s received some damage, but it&rsquo;s just the first step. Not just
                        anyone
                        can serve on the student council. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By appointing Kushida to that position, the students will be made to feel that
                        she is
                        needed in the class, and she will avoid being cut off.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Kushida&rsquo;s childish feelings of not wanting to be led by Horikita
                        were
                        a hindrance.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With that, your class has an exclusive hold in the Student Council among
                        year-two. That&rsquo;s certainly an advantage.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Student Council President Nagumo accepts it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He said it himself, didn&rsquo;t he? That you&rsquo;re free to invite
                        anyone
                        from your own class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but that had a nuance of telling me to &ldquo;try it
                        if
                        You&rsquo;re brave enough&rdquo;.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just show him how brave you are, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to say for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita looks glum, but she&rsquo;s contradicting herself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She went as far as bowing down to Kushida just to enter her into the Student
                        Council
                        for a slight advantage to her class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do you call that, if not bravery?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think that was the best way to convince Kushida.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think so too. I see that our new Student Council President is handling
                        things well.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Showing how interested she is by overreacting, Amasawa nodded from behind.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Are you going to keep following me around? The show&rsquo;s over
                        already.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;m curious who else you&rsquo;re going to invite.
                        Aren&rsquo;t we close enough for that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have a relationship where we can relax and chat
                        with
                        each other.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really? We opposed each other a little, but wasn&rsquo;t that only in the
                        Special Test? Shouldn&rsquo;t we be getting along now that it&rsquo;s over?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita wrinkled her brows a little, but she gave up, knowing that she
                        can&rsquo;t
                        force Amasawa to leave.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about you take Amasawa into the Student Council? Her OAA is certainly
                        good
                        enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if there are no problems with her OAA, she&rsquo;s not suited to be
                        in
                        the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh~? Why can&rsquo;t you just invite me? I might accept, you
                        know.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pass.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Amasawa isn&rsquo;t fitting for the Student Council that Horikita
                        has
                        in mind.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it&rsquo;s true that she&rsquo;s unfitting for a serious Student
                        Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have anyone else in mind?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are a few candidates, but&hellip; I wonder if he&rsquo;s still in
                        the
                        school?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;he&rdquo; mentioned must be the year-one student she&rsquo;s
                        targeting.
                        Horikita looked around the year-one building, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to find the person she
                        was looking
                        for. After looking around from A Class to D Class, she sighed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe he&#39;s already left after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita complained a little that she spent too much time dealing with Kushida
                        and
                        Amasawa. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn&rsquo;t give up right away, however, and called out to us.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask his classmates directly. Wait here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, she entered the year-one A Class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amasawa and I looked at each other and waited for her to come back.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So? Were you looking for me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? Oh, the reason I came to visit the year-two students?
                        Curious?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sticking with us instead of going back, so of
                        course.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be honest, I just came to see how Kushida-senpai was doing. I mean, we
                        had
                        some forced contact back in the Culture Festival, so I wondered how things were going. Besides,
                        Takuya also
                        gave her a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You still seemed to be teasing Kushida a lot.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amasa stuck her tongue out a little and smiled.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how I am, of course I&rsquo;d mess with her. I also
                        wanted
                        to check how strong she&rsquo;s become psychologically.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see. I thought she was just being aggressive, but there was a reasoning behind
                        it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it was a miscalculation for Kushida that the White Room students
                        got
                        involved, but it also helped her break out of her shell as a result. I guess it all turned out
                        alright in
                        the end.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Amasawa smiled a little.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I gotta be of some use too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The reason you came to see Kushida makes sense, but that doesn&rsquo;t
                        explain
                        why you&rsquo;re still following us around.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Simple curiosity. You care about Horikita-senpai, don&rsquo;t you?
                        She&rsquo;s
                        even going to become the Student Council President, so I wanted to experience her charm first
                        hand. She
                        seems serious, but she&rsquo;s also a little out of the ordinary and is quite interesting. I
                        even actually
                        thought of joining the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you should have acted a little more seriously.
                        Horikita already senses that you&rsquo;re a skilled person, so she could have accepted
                        you.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. There&rsquo;s no point in joining the Student
                        Council now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s no point in joining now? Even if the second term is ending, Amasawa
                        is
                        still a year-one. She has plenty of time to join the Student Council in Yagami&rsquo;s stead and
                        serve out
                        her time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, I thought back to the conversation I had with her before the school
                        trip.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you going to do? Have you still not changed your
                        mind?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After my indirect remark, Amasawa&rsquo;s eyes became sharper.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well done, Ayanokoji-senpai. You managed to notice it among my roundabout
                        words.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You did say that you wouldn&rsquo;t cause me any trouble, and that I would
                        be
                        the only one receiving special treatment.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not that difficult to make the relation between Yagami&rsquo;s
                        expulsion
                        and the Student Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like the reason you signed was that you wanted to stop him.
                        That&rsquo;s not in your character.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is correct. I guess it&rsquo;s that I wanted to know whether you have
                        a
                        positive or negative stance on this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you what you want to do. If I am to say more,
                        you&rsquo;re
                        free to withdraw your previous remarks and turn your desire for revenge towards
                        me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a broad-minded statement, or rather one that gives a lot of
                        leeway.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After talking with the year-one students for a while, Horikita came out with a
                        satisfied expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting. Let&rsquo;s move.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita&rsquo;s steps were a little quicker than usual as she started to
                        walk.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who did you really want to meet here?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know him. His name is Ishigami.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ishigami?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must be the Ishigami that&rsquo;s coming up in my mind.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are no other students with the same name in year-one.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s pretty smart of you to have your eye on Ishigami-kun,
                        Horikita-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amasawa, who is also a year-one student and his classmate naturally knew and
                        recognized him, which she showed with her reaction.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is he a good student? Like a class leader type person?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided to ask Horikita and Amasawa about Ishigami, pretending to know nothing
                        about him.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not really a leader, but he&rsquo;s like an adviser for A
                        Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike most students, Amasawa won&rsquo;t let it be seen when she&rsquo;s
                        uncomfortable.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s never shown me whether she knew about Ishigami beforehand, who knows
                        my
                        true identity.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s nothing to hide now, so I can believe that she knows nothing about
                        it,
                        but it&rsquo;s dangerous to make assumptions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his connection with you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t expect to hear Ishigami&rsquo;s name coming from Horikita, so I
                        decided to ask why.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a bit of an acquaintance. His Academic Ability on the OAA
                        is
                        good enough, and he seemed to be getting relied on a lot by his classmates. I think he&rsquo;s
                        the right
                        person. He was apparently in the classroom just now, so we can still catch up to
                        him.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s walking pretty quickly, though. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never thought about meeting Ishigami with Horikita like this, but there&rsquo;s
                        no
                        use worrying about it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have an odd connection with each other, but it&rsquo;s conceivable that one of
                        us
                        may unexpectedly try to contact the other, or that we may one day be assigned to the same group
                        in some
                        Special Exam.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trying to avoid him by force would be an act contrary to the natural order of
                        things.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we approached the hallway leading to the entrance, we saw a small group of
                        boys
                        chatting in a circle.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita quickly noticed Ishigami among them and approached.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ishigami-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishigami turned around when Horikita called his name, and quietly looked at
                        us.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is an unexpected first meeting, but Ishigami doesn&rsquo;t seem to be upset
                        in
                        the least.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the contrary, he seemed to be ignoring my presence.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can understand why he isn&rsquo;t surprised, as this is a small school and we
                        were
                        bound to meet at some point. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other year-one students were familiar with Amasawa, but they seemed nervous
                        about
                        the presence of me and Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you want something?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I came to ask you for a favour. Would you like to enter the Student
                        Council?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishigami threw a silent look&#305; at his friends.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, go ahead. I&rsquo;ll catch up with you guys
                        soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was there a plan to hang out together after this?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t want to take up too much of your
                        time.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. But, why me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishigami is speaking formally with her. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be speaking
                        casually
                        like he did with me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have very little interaction with year-one students. You&rsquo;re one of
                        the
                        few I&rsquo;ve talked to, and you&rsquo;re in A Class. You also excel in Academic Ability in the
                        OAA.
                        What&rsquo;s so surprising about me inviting you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Certainly, there is nothing wrong with his abilities. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Horikita said, there is no doubt that he is a person who would easily be
                        approached by the Student Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be participating in club activities either right
                        now,
                        so how about it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m not interested in joining the Student
                        Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ishigami quickly declined without hesitation.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even get you to consider it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to participate in club activities, and I don&rsquo;t
                        want
                        to participate in the Student Council either. Please try someone else.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying this, Ishigami turned around and started walking away. Horikita
                        hesitated about calling out to him for a moment, but he clearly has no interest in the Student
                        Council, so
                        it seems she decided not to force things.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He was pretty unapproachable, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought he would be a good candidate, but I guess I have to give up on
                        him.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are a lot of other good students in A Class, so maybe there&rsquo;s
                        still a chance to get in touch with them?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to believe that, but&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. The
                        ambitious
                        students would want to enter the Student Council as quickly as they can, just like Ichinose-san
                        from last
                        year and Yagami-kun from this year, right? If they haven&rsquo;t taken any action up until now,
                        that means
                        they don&rsquo;t want anything to do with the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed. If they were interested, they would have knocked on the door during the
                        Nagumo administration.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All I have left is year-one D Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;D Class? That&rsquo;s a surprising choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Student Council&rsquo;s approach is to elect students from A and B classes,
                        as
                        they have a high percentage of competent and earnest students. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, why D Class?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The difference between them and C Class is 200 points, so they still have
                        a
                        chance. The birth of a Student Council member should be a boost for the D Class. There might be
                        students who
                        see it that way. We just have to make them aware of the advantages.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about inviting Housen-kun or someone like that? It might be
                        interesting.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Probably hoping to cause a stir, Amasawa recommended an unthinkable
                        person.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would want to join. Even if he did, I
                        wouldn&rsquo;t be
                        able to accept him with his current violent behaviour. He would have to achieve a lot of good
                        results in the
                        next year.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita rejected the playful proposal, judging that he would not be fitting.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita returned to D Class and looked around at the remaining students in the
                        classroom. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the students quickly noticed her and approached.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Welcome, Horikita-senpai, Ayanokoji-senpai, and Amasawa-san
                        too.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s Nanase Tsubasa, a very polite student unlike the others in year-one D
                        Class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit surprised to see you here with them too,
                        Amasawa-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wouldn&rsquo;t go as far as calling it caution, but Nanase said so and threw a
                        glance at me and Amasawa.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like most of the students have left already.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a lot fewer here than normal. There&rsquo;s usually
                        a
                        few more students left here at this time.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. One of our classmates has a birthday, and they&rsquo;re celebrating
                        it in
                        Keyaki Mall. I was also invited&hellip; Actually, why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s only natural that she would ask that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is a vacancy in the Student Council because of Yagami Takuya being
                        expelled. I&rsquo;m here to fill the vacancy.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you recruiting members for the Student Council?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been decided that I&rsquo;m going to become the Student Council
                        President, so this is my first task.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nanase nodded with admiration, and looked over her D Class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can someone from D Class stand as a candidate too?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m from D Class too, after all, so there&rsquo;s no
                        reason
                        to refuse any of you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, would you let me help you out?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...You?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. If you think even someone like me could be of assistance too, of
                        course&hellip; I&rsquo;d definitely want to help out with the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know what decision the soon to retire President Nagumo
                        will
                        make, however.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She replied that it&rsquo;s still not a sure thing.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita may not remember the details of Nanase&rsquo;s OAA, so I&rsquo;ll
                        supplement.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, isn&rsquo;t it? Nanase has a good OAA and is very
                        serious, I
                        think she&rsquo;s fitting for the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I don&rsquo;t think there are any problems with her.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This would be a quick solution after being refused by Ishigami.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, may I count on you then, Nanase-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course!!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have my doubts about Nanase, but that&rsquo;s that, and this is this.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she&rsquo;s going to take a role in the Student Council&rsquo;s formation,
                        then
                        there&rsquo;s no reason to refuse her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think Nanase-chan will do just great.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Unlike you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you making fun of me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think highly of your abilities. But, your candid attitude and way of
                        thinking and personality just aren&rsquo;t suited for the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita nodded in satisfaction at this last minute addition to the Student
                        Council.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, so what should I do after tomorrow!?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be any problems, but I&rsquo;ll talk to
                        President Nagumo first tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll contact you again after that when you&rsquo;ve been
                        accepted
                        into the Student Council.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita exchanged contact information with Nanase.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that was done, Nanase smiled with joy.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always glad to have more contacts, in any way I
                        can.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you tomorrow, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I will be waiting for your contact!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Nanase off with a smile, we left the D Class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like I gathered the members. All I have to do now is to wait for an
                        answer from President Nagumo.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get going too, then. See you later, you two.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We saw Amasawa off, who came and left like a storm.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always so hard to tell what that girl is
                        thinking.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks for your help today.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I just followed you around and didn&rsquo;t really do anything.
                        I&rsquo;m glad it was easy.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. It&rsquo;s clear that your words had an effect on
                        the
                        Kushida matter. I&rsquo;ll make sure to report that you were helpful.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must be referring to the time when I dragged out the presentation from
                        Kushida.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get any compliments from Nagumo, but
                        I&rsquo;m
                        so happy that I could burst into tears.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? Oh, I&rsquo;m having a study session at a cafe in Keyaki Mall after
                        this. Do you want to come? Your girlfriend is also going to participate.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A study session, huh? Well, I think I&rsquo;ll drop by for a
                        bit.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though she&rsquo;s the one who invited me, Horikita showed a surprised
                        expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I was just sure that you would refuse. Is it because of
                        Karuizawa-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s not really true, but I guess that&rsquo;s how she has to see
                        it.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m worried if she&rsquo;s studying
                        properly.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Replying so, I decided to go to the cafe with Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c20">Part 3</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two of us arrived at the cafe where the study group was meeting after
                        school.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey everyone, sorry I kept you waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying so, Horikita joined her classmates in a natural manner.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noticing her movements here, I&rsquo;m impressed at how much she&rsquo;s
                        improved.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kiyotaka, you came too!?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Facing a notebook with a frown, Kei noticed us and smiled.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, but I&rsquo;m just here for a quick visit.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei showed a clearly dissatisfied expression, but no further complaints
                        followed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think it was largely due to the fact that I had told her in advance that I
                        would
                        not be helping her out with studying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, sorry I&rsquo;m late!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right after we arrived, Sudou hurriedly ran into the caf&eacute;.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really hard to balance studying with club activities,
                        isn&rsquo;t
                        it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal. I&rsquo;m used to it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sudou&rsquo;s gaze was caught by Horikita for a moment, but then he sat down on
                        an
                        empty seat nearby.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he placed his bag on his lap and took out a set of study materials. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then took out a rectangular case, and pulled out a pair of glasses from
                        it.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Sudou-kun, do you wear glasses?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I just started to. I&rsquo;ve been wearing them when I study. Ah,
                        they
                        don&rsquo;t really have a degree or anything, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If a person has good vision, they usually don&rsquo;t use corrective devices such
                        as
                        glasses.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, good eyesight does not mean that one cannot or should not wear glasses.
                        Studying is a close-range battle, unlike basketball which requires a wide field of
                        vision.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adjusting your focus when looking at things is a big burden.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like most of the other students, Kei was surprised to see Sudou in studying
                        mode
                        like this in the study session.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all the staring?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You just have a different image with your glasses on. You really are
                        studying
                        more now, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shinohara nudged her boyfriend Ike while showing admiration for Sudou.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m trying my best too now!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know that. Sudou-kun has quite a lead on you, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, well, yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ike tried to argue back, but he nodded in response to her stinging words.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, sorry. I shouldn&rsquo;t talk about other people like that. But, you
                        know,
                        do you have any tricks to keep going for a long time? I used to be at a similar level too, and I
                        was
                        wondering if you could give me any tips. It must be hard to balance basketball and studying at
                        the same
                        time, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other students nodded in agreement with Shionara.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">To the students with lower academic ability, students like Yousuke, Mii-chan, and
                        Horikita must seem to be in the realm of prodigies and geniuses.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would not be able to put what they learn from such high-level students into
                        practice.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are smart from the start, so they must seem like they can do
                        anything.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this respect, Sudou started out with the lowest academic ability in his class.
                        It
                        is only natural that she would want to know the key to his growth.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tricks, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sudou crossed his arms in a somewhat troubled manner.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita was the main reason that Sudou originally started studying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wanted to be smarter and become a man worthy of Horikita, but Sudou would
                        probably
                        be very reluctant to talk about that here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, umm&hellip; Right.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sudou was about to start speaking after a while, but he started sorting things in
                        his
                        head. He was still a bit awkward, but he began speaking:</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The weird thing is, studying has actually become fun for me. Then,
                        basketball
                        became more interesting too. &hellip;Umm, I guess it&rsquo;s something like that?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He began to explain why he is able to do both, and that there are other
                        advantages as
                        well.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At first, I didn&rsquo;t like studying. I got sleepy right away, and I
                        couldn&rsquo;t solve the problems. But you know, the more you learn, the more you realize how
                        useful
                        studying is for school.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, you know, Ken. Studying is useless for the future, isn&rsquo;t it?
                        Especially depending on your occupation.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ike asked Sudou about a doubt that everyone must have had at least once in their
                        lives.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a professional basketball player myself, so I
                        thought
                        studying was just a pain in the ass, but what if I don&rsquo;t make it as a pro? What job can I
                        do if I
                        don&rsquo;t even study? I could probably do a job that anyone could do, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no need to name a specific profession, but his options would be more
                        limited
                        than those of an average person.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if I don&rsquo;t make it as a pro, my options will be broader if I
                        keep
                        studying, right? I could also go to university and study something more specialized. Well, I
                        have no
                        concrete plans yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can have more than one dream.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Studying is an investment in your future. That&rsquo;s how I think of
                        it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sudou&rsquo;s path to becoming a professional basketball player, which he has
                        been
                        pursuing for many years, may fail.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he finds another big dream and holds on to it however, he will never fail in
                        life.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the short story of Sudou, whose thinking has grown through his
                        studies.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What might have been sneered at in the past was listened to earnestly without
                        making
                        fun of by anyone around him. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how much weight and truth was born by his words. Sudou sat back down
                        with an embarrassed expression on his face, and hurriedly opened his notebook.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s enough, right? Let&rsquo;s get studying
                        already.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sudou, who should be more tired than anyone else after working hard in his club,
                        said
                        this without showing any sign of exhaustion. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He isn&rsquo;t the type to make good speeches, but that&rsquo;s why his words and
                        attitude full of truthfulness strike a chord with people. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The students in the lower positions such as Shinohara and Ike must also be moved
                        by
                        this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c20">Part 4</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day after the new Student Council members were gathered and the study
                        sessions for the Special Test began. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita was quickly called by Nagumo after school, and seemed to be heading to
                        the
                        Student Council room. I thought she wouldn&rsquo;t call on me again, but-</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He said that you should come with me too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She displayed a message from Nagumo and came over to tell me as she pointed the
                        screen at me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My stomach feels as upset as it did yesterday, let me pass on
                        that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, then. He&rsquo;ll just call you again tomorrow
                        if
                        you can&rsquo;t come today, though?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just meet him and get it over with.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t want to be forced to do something troublesome again after some time
                        passes. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I immediately got up and showed my intention to go to the Student Council room,
                        but I
                        was stopped.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring Kushida-san here. Wait a bit.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that he means to meet all the new members at once. I looked around for
                        Kushida in the classroom, but&hellip; She was already nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like she went ahead.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I lined up shoulder to shoulder with an exasperated Horikita and left the
                        classroom.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So she didn&rsquo;t want to go with you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to spend a lot more time when the Student Council work
                        starts, whether she likes it or not.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that must be why she didn&rsquo;t even want to spend one more second than
                        she
                        has to with Horikita in an unrelated area.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite the nuisance to be randomly resented by someone while
                        continuously being connected with them somehow.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened if you were a little more
                        gentle-mannered as a person.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It could have been worse, right? It&rsquo;s dangerous to keep letting her
                        take
                        the lead.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needs to hold the reins and control her to some degree, that&rsquo;s
                        certainly
                        true. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I arrived at the Student Council room, Kushida and Nanase were waiting side
                        by
                        side in the distance.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether or not these two knew each other or not, they seemed to be chatting and
                        getting along well.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re having a good time.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They really are.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking a look at the two, they don&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;ll ever stop
                        talking.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They seem to be in a peaceful mood, constantly smiling. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would keep chatting forever if kept alone.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like the Student Council can get along just fine without you,
                        Horikita. I&rsquo;m sure those two will be well received by the public too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up. Let&rsquo;s just go in.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita quickly approached them to prevent them from getting even more
                        excited.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi there, Horikita-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida smiled without concealment as Nanase politely greeted Horikita.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was a bit relieved when I heard that Nanase-san was joining the Student
                        Council too. I&rsquo;ve been very nervous about all this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida said something unexpected and made a gesture of patting her chest.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three members of the Student Council entered the room first.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel very strange about following them in, but I&rsquo;ve been called, so
                        there&rsquo;s no helping it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Student Council President Nagumo. I&rsquo;ve invited Kushida Kikyou from
                        year-two B Class, and Nanase Tsubasa from year-one D Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You actually picked someone from your own class? That&rsquo;s quite bold
                        of
                        you, Suzune.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo laughed, implying that he was half joking when he said Horikita could
                        invite
                        someone from her own class.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I chose them from an impartial point of view. Are you dissatisfied with my
                        selections?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is just her official stance, but Horikita lied without hesitation about this
                        not
                        being for the sake of her own class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn&rsquo;t believable after she brought in Kushida, but Nagumo showed a
                        superficial agreement to this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at the new Student Council members, this is an unfamiliar structure with
                        Nagumo, Kiriyama, and Ichinose leaving, and Yagami having gotten expelled.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think this is the first time there are more girls than boys in the

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Former Vice President Kiriyama also took a look at the members and told us what
                        he
                        noticed.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It should be alright. Women and men are equal these days. This just means
                        that
                        there are more women in the next generation of talented people. Isn&rsquo;t that right,
                        Ayanokoji?&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not a bad thing for girls to come into power, but if the ideal thing
                        is a
                        1 to 1 ratio, one could say that this result reflects the timidness of the boys.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Serve the Student Council from a fair point of view.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, I guess that means that I am being relieved of my duties as

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He patted his seat once as if having a hard time parting with it, and got

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It felt like both a long time and a short time. I don&rsquo;t really have

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have any regrets?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Nagumo&rsquo;s sad expression, Horikita asked so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The most important thing is to create an environment where the students
                        with
                        the ability to surpass the limits of their class can graduate in A Class. I could not reach that
                        ideal.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo did emphasize that point quite strongly when he first took over as Student
                        Council President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, the year-threes are in a similar situation to that, but that&rsquo;s
                        more a result of the rules that Nagumo created personally rather than the results of his
                        achievements as
                        Student Council President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Student Council here has more authority than normal high schools, but
                        there was still no way to overturn the school&rsquo;s decisions. I thought I could have done
                        more.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You still definitely had an effect on things, Nagumo-senpai. There were no
                        rules such as class transfer tickets or protection points up until now.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether or not this will produce good results will be discovered by future
                        generations. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita Manabu protected the Advanced Nurturing High School&rsquo;s traditions,
                        and
                        served well as the Student Council President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Nagumo Miyabi created the OAA, and brought about a new, more
                        ability-oriented
                        style.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">How will Horikita Suzune&rsquo;s year as Student Council President go?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most obvious, and difficult goal will be&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">To start in D Class and graduate in A Class. If she succeeds in that,
                        she&rsquo;ll
                        definitely leave her name in history as a Student Council President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are a few formalities that need to be completed, everyone except
                        Ayanokoji should remain here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that directive from Kiriyama, I was informed that I was in the way.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my leave now, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you later, Ayanokoji. Our duel&rsquo;s still not over
                        yet.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that he called me all the way here just to remind me of that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I bowed slightly and left the Student Council room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After leaving Horikita and the others behind, I took out my cell phone.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s been vibrating inside my pocket, but it looks like I&rsquo;ve got some
                        messages. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought they were from my girlfriend Kei, but it doesn&rsquo;t look that
                        way.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an invitation on a vacation day from a surprising person.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He said that he&rsquo;d like to talk with me on the weekend if I have
                        time.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time I was through the corridor, I received a message offering a specific
                        time
                        and place to meet at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday in Keyaki Mall.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There would be no problems with that, so I replied that would be fine.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No mention was made about the contents of the conversation, but it was not
                        difficult
                        to guess the direction from the name of my companion. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While leaving, I walked by a female student.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Were you called to the Student Council room again?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re headed for the Student Council too today,
                        Kiryuuin-senpai. Is it about the matter from the other day?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. The conversation ended up going on a parallel track
                        after that, and is still unresolved.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite the calamity.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the looks of Nagumo back then, it probably ended without him replying with a
                        yes
                        or a no.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to take a more aggressive approach
                        today.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Feel free to do that, but it&rsquo;s quite crowded right now.
                        They&rsquo;re in
                        the middle of the procedures for Horikita to become the new Student Council President and for
                        registering
                        the new members.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She might force her way in without caring about that, but I made sure to tell her
                        anyway. It seemed to have more of an effect than I thought however, and Kiryuuin stopped in her
                        tracks to
                        think for a moment.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my leave, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My intuition told me that I should leave right away, but it was already too
                        late.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can I take up some of your time, Ayanokoji?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;....Is it about that unsolved matter?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if I press Nagumo again, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll spit it out
                        so
                        easily.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to traumatize the new Student Council President
                        and
                        the new members, would you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t care about that in the least. Still, if she wants to avoid that,
                        she
                        can simply wait for Horikita and the others to leave.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You figured that using me would be better than simply forcing your way
                        through
                        it, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. You&rsquo;re quick as always, Ayanokoji.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She snapped her fingers and complimented me, but anyone could have figured this
                        out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were just leaving anyway, right? Why don&rsquo;t you come with
                        me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have a date planned at my room with my girlfriend.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just let her wait. It&rsquo;s a girlfriend&rsquo;s duty to quietly wait
                        for
                        the return of the house&rsquo;s patriarch.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s definitely not convincing when Kiryuuin is the one who says
                        that.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can we talk while walking?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. That would be fine too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin turned around and matched my pace of walking.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you try to set up an opportunity to talk with Yamanaka-senpai
                        again?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nagumo and Kiriyama strongly objected to it. I&rsquo;ve accused Nagumo as
                        the
                        principal offender, so you shouldn&rsquo;t expect a different result.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it? For the person who is suspected to
                        be
                        the culprit to stop your contact.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether it was Nagumo who gave the order or not, as long as Kiryuuin claims that
                        he
                        did, he must have decided that it was unlikely that any other big names would come out after
                        threatening
                        Yamanaka.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly true, but even I agreed with him. You can&rsquo;t
                        &nbsp;expect any other names to come up after verbally threatening Yamanaka. When I first
                        questioned her, I
                        had already threatened her with as much as I could, excluding violence or torture.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, Kiryuuin already got what she could out of Yamanaka.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thinking about it logically, it has to be Student Council President
                        Nagumo,
                        doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I suspect him. That&rsquo;s why I tried to barge in like this. I
                        can&rsquo;t push this any further without proof though, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as a result, she was planning to seriously threaten Nagumo.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still possible that Nagumo isn&rsquo;t the criminal. Do you
                        understand why that is?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the possibility that Yamanaka-senpai could have held a grudge
                        against you without you realizing it. That would also explain her trying to get revenge by
                        framing you as a
                        shoplifter. I don&rsquo;t know a lot about the circumstances in year-three, but there could be
                        some people
                        that dislike you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s painfully true.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nodded without denying it, laughing rather than getting angry.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it Nagumo, or is it Yamanaka? Or is there a completely different third
                        party hiding in the background?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about leaving it alone? If the criminal has learned their lesson from
                        this
                        incident, they&rsquo;ll probably pull back and pretend it never happened before their true
                        identity is
                        revealed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. My pride won&rsquo;t allow me to ignore someone trying to make me out
                        to
                        be a criminal.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the look of things, she doesn&rsquo;t look like she&rsquo;ll stop pursuing
                        this
                        until the criminal is caught.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop, no matter what. So, I was wondering if you would do
                        the
                        searching for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like I have any obligation to help you. Besides, I
                        don&rsquo;t have much contact with year-three students. It&rsquo;s pretty much just you or
                        Student Council
                        members like Nagumo-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not flattering to say that I&rsquo;m the right person to secretly
                        gather
                        information.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why I&rsquo;m asking you. You have a flat point of
                        view, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would make more sense if you asked someone with some good communication
                        skills&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I certainly can&rsquo;t expect much from you on that front. However, I
                        have
                        nothing to criticize about your other abilities. You&rsquo;re especially above everyone in your
                        fight sense.
                        There is no other person who has convinced me of a complete defeat without a direct
                        confrontation.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think I&rsquo;m being complimented, but it doesn&rsquo;t make me happy at
                        all.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are some year-three students with a violent temperament. It&rsquo;s
                        not
                        a bad thing to have a strong arm, you know.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Win or lose, I don&rsquo;t want to fight with a year-three

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on, just help me out. There&rsquo;s no one that I could call a
                        friend. I
                        can&rsquo;t act like a detective either.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s so selfish. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sympathize with the fact that Kiryuuin-senpai was framed, but it would be
                        better to
                        refuse here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think you owe me one for the incident on the uninhabited island. You
                        could
                        have handled it without me showing up too, of course, but I may have to bring it up to the
                        Student Council
                        to make sure. I think you wouldn&rsquo;t like everyone to know the entire story of your battle
                        with the
                        former board chairman, would you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She blocked my escape route with an aggressive approach, not allowing me to
                        refuse.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you were going to threaten me, things would have been easier if you had
                        done that from the start.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin brazenly looked over at me while crossing her arms.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Fine. I&rsquo;ll look around a bit, okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
