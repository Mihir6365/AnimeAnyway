        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, two days left in the second term. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today is the day of the Special Cooperative Written Test, a direct confrontation
                        with
                        A Class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although there are some special rules, it is mostly the same as the usual
                        mid-term
                        and final tests.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many of the students with Academic Ability C or below have been studying in the
                        classroom since the morning, using as much time as they can spare.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Keisei and Horikita, the instructors who had already finished all their studies
                        in
                        advance, were watching over the students and giving them some advice and making careful final
                        checks.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many of the students think that the most difficult Special Test is on its way,
                        but
                        that&rsquo;s not true.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the saying goes, &ldquo;80% is in the preparation&rdquo;, and most of the
                        preparations have been completed. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The attitude and the focus towards the Special Test. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Compared to these, the test itself is only about one-fifth of the workload.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it&rsquo;s over, you notice that it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal after
                        all.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The test procedure is based on the sheet that Horikita had submitted to
                        Chabashira
                        last night, which lays out the order in which everyone will take the test.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since everyone is allowed to solve any question out of the 100 questions, some
                        might
                        think that the order is not that important.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the order is very important. 10 minutes are allotted to each
                        participant,
                        including the time when leaving the room.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a good amount of time to solve problems, but it&rsquo;s definitely not
                        enough
                        to read and understand all of the 100 questions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If a student with low Academic Ability struggles to read and comprehend a
                        problem,
                        not only will they not be able to find five easy problems and write down the answers, but they
                        will also
                        probably make easy mistakes due to running out of time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, the order in which the problems are solved is the key to reducing this
                        probability.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Less than five minutes remaining until the bell rings to signal the start of the
                        test.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While everyone was feeling a strong sense of tension, Kouenji was the only one
                        who
                        remained the same.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Horikita&rsquo;s prior confirmation, she could not tell if Kouenji
                        was
                        serious or not. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He simply replied that he had the right to do whatever he wanted.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita, who understood that the strategy she had worked so hard to put together
                        would be ruined if Kouenji alone disturbed it, made a wise offer.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She decided to have Kouenji be the last student to solve problems.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that point, 98 problems out of 100 would already be filled in and 2 would be
                        left
                        for him.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if Kouenji, who is originally in the B rank in Academic Ability, cannot
                        answer
                        the two problems, the loss is 4 points. It&rsquo;s unlikely to be a big blow. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Further, since they are the last two problems, even if he did not answer them, it
                        would not be a violation of the rules, as we could pass it off as him being unable to solve the
                        problems
                        rather than doing it on purpose.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether he decides to solve the problems, leave them blank or makes a mistake,
                        there
                        is no risk.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kouenji earnestly agreed to that proposal. If the class is going to go up by 50
                        points if we win, then Kouenji shouldn&rsquo;t have any opposition to solving the problems
                        correctly.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather, if we lose the 50 points we could gain because of him, then the private
                        points Kouenji himself could collect would decrease.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since it&rsquo;s impossible to estimate Kouenji&rsquo;s conduct based on common
                        sense
                        alone, Horikita had no choice but to use the strategy I just described.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The test will certainly not be easy.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I can&rsquo;t be optimistic, the conditions for victory are on our
                        side.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pressure on the students with low Academic Ability in A Class will be
                        great.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The leader of the class, Sakyanagi is probably planning a strategy, but each
                        student
                        will take the test alone in the room, and the nature of the surveillance will make it impossible
                        to find a
                        different way of fighting.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can also say that it&rsquo;s impossible to make the low Academic Ability
                        students
                        solve all the questions.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, all that can be done by a class is to raise their current
                        fighting
                        strength to the highest possible level, and then rearrange the order in such a way to maximize
                        their
                        strength. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or, like Ryuuen, to directly harass the others outside the test. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are some rough methods such as making a secret agreement to intentionally
                        create a loss of points, but all of the results in this test will be public. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one makes a blatant mistake, they will run the risk of being detected as a
                        traitor, and above all, there is no guarantee that a class can win by buying out one or two
                        people. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a school full of students who are always doing their best, it is kind of an
                        accident that entities like me and Kouenji, who have not received a proper evaluation in the OAA
                        are mixed
                        in.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that one with lower evaluated Academic Ability than the reality can get
                        a
                        few points is significant. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can say that there are several conditions in place that are favourable for the
                        Horikita class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the guidance of Chabashira-sensei after the bell rang, we moved to the
                        Special
                        Test building and started waiting. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We then followed the order created by Horikita and started solving the questions
                        one
                        by one in the next classroom. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we need to do is to repeat this until the last one, Kouenji.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under the supervision of the teacher, students are not allowed to bring in tools
                        or
                        cellphones. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chatting is also forbidden, and everyone is to wait for their turn in
                        silence.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that remains to be seen now is whether or not the students will be able to
                        show
                        off what they&rsquo;ve learned without losing to stress.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.1v1yuxt"><span class="c20">Part 1</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The students sighed with relief after the long Special Test ended.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good work, everyone. The results will be announced tomorrow, but classes
                        are
                        over as well for today. Act with restraint during the winter holiday starting the day after
                        tomorrow.
                        That&rsquo;s all for today.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these words of appreciation from Chabashira-sensei, the school day came to
                        an
                        end. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that remains is to wait for tomorrow&rsquo;s closing ceremony.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many of the students will be released from this oppressive time and be able to
                        fly
                        freely. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of the students were discussing how well or poorly they had solved the
                        problems,
                        but Horikita did not take the initiative to formulate an opinion and grade herself. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if she guessed how many points they could get here, there is still the
                        opponent
                        class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of all, the results will be announced tomorrow, so it seems that she saw no
                        point in doing so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei sitting quietly near me spoke to me in a quiet voice.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip; I, I think it&rsquo;s about time I forgive you.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said so with timidness and some confusion.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can I talk with you a bit?&rdquo; said Horikita</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry Horikita-san, can you do this later?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I would, if I could. Unfortunately however, it&rsquo;s a matter of the
                        Student
                        Council. Vice President Kiriyama, no, former Vice President Kiriyama called us to the Student
                        Council
                        room.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if trying to prove it, Horikita showed me the message on her phone.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kushida was also standing a little behind her, smiling.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, Kei. Let&rsquo;s talk after this is over. You can message me any
                        time.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;M-mhm. See you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I left Kei in the classroom and went with Horikita and Kushida.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s Student Council business again right
                        after
                        the Special Test. It looks like Nagumo-senpai is there as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those two aren&rsquo;t in the Student Council any more. You don&rsquo;t
                        have

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. Even if they have nothing to do with the Student
                        Council any more, they&rsquo;re still upperclassmen. Besides, it&rsquo;s about Kiryuuin-senpai
                        this time.
                        Remember that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is an event within my expectations after talking about it with Kiryuuin many
                        times last night. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it is an unexpected development that this matter was conveyed to
                        Horikita
                        from Kiriyama. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The original plan was for it to be just Kiryuuin, Kiriyama, Nagumo and me.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey. I don&rsquo;t know what this is about, what happened with

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her about it. There&rsquo;s something I need to convey to

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About a testimony I got from a third party on this shoplifting
                        case.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we arrived at the front of the Student Council room after finishing our
                        talk,
                        there were two year-one students there. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aga from A Class, and Nanase, who had joined the Student Council with Kushida.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wonder if all of the Student Council members are here. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like someone else has made developments in this case.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is kind of like my first job in the Student Council. I quickly joined
                        as
                        a secretary.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said so and held onto her notebook.</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I heard that a secretary&rsquo;s job is to write things down,
                        so.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, is there? But I already bought one&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that she was so enthusiastic about serving on the Student Council that
                        she
                        got a little ahead of herself.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not a big problem, but if you have the receipt you can
                        give
                        it to me later. I&rsquo;ll pay for it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-yes. Sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita told her that she would settle the notebook fee from the Student

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s enter the room then, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo had already arrived at the Student Council room and was waiting inside
                        with
                        Kiriyama.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was standing up, instead of sitting down on his usual seat of the
                        President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, Horikita. The year-twos must be tired after the Special
                        Test.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a problem. But, it was about Kiryuuin-senpai&rsquo;s
                        case&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita asked Nagumo about the matter I had explained to her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Kiriyama contacted me. He said that Kiryuuin was going to be
                        bringing a
                        lawsuit to the Student Council, and that I should get prepared.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A lawsuit to the Student Council..?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">First time I&rsquo;m hearing of it. Suing the Student Council? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had no idea Kiryuuin was using such a method.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still, did you call Ayanokoji here too, Kiriyama?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He was here back then too. I decided that it was necessary. It&rsquo;s a
                        judgement I made while considering that it would be troubling if he spread clumsy rumours
                        without knowing
                        anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;s lucky to see your debut,
                        Suzune.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying so, Nagumo signaled for Horikita to sit down on the seat of the
                        President.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a polite bow, Horikita sat down in the chair.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You chose Kushida for the Vice President, after all?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I also thought about asking Aga-kun, but I thought Kushida-san would
                        be
                        more fitting as she knows more about the school. Is there a problem?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I have no complaints about the Student Council President&rsquo;s
                        personnel
                        selection.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Student Council President Horikita and the newly appointed Vice President Kushida
                        sat
                        down without exchanging any jokes with serious looks on their faces.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&#39;s got a lot of nerves though, being late like this after calling
                        us
                        here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this deliberation, Kiryuuin Fuuka entered the room as the last person to
                        show
                        up.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting, Student Council President.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please take a seat.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No thanks. I&rsquo;ll talk standing up. That&rsquo;s alright,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. May I ask you a few questions, then?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ask me anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like you decided on suing the Student Council, but I&rsquo;d like
                        to
                        hear the contents.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita asked, pretending not to know anything.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sue?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin curiously tilted her head, but Kiriyama quickly urged her on.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already lost time because of your tardiness. Please proceed
                        without wasting any more time.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So impatient. Well, let me explain how it all happened.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin was almost framed as a shoplifter by year-three D Class student Yamanaka
                        in
                        the Keyaki Mall after school. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin luckily noticed that something was being snuck into her bag, and stopped
                        her. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shoplifting itself ended in an unsuccessful attempt.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think Yamanaka did this because of some personal
                        grudge
                        herself, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin glanced at Nagumo.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When I questioned Yamanaka, she confessed that she was instructed to
                        commit
                        the crime by a certain person.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who was this person?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the former Student Council President here, Nagumo
                        Miyabi.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The year-one students hearing this for the first time looked over at Nagumo in
                        shock.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A matter that occurred with Kiryuuin at the center. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A problematic act. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was it according to Yamanaka&rsquo;s own intentions, or not? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s the former, she must be punished after being questioned. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it&rsquo;s the latter, the criminal must be found. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I will see if Horikita can peacefully handle her first problem.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nagumo-senpai, do you have any objections to what Kiryuuin-senpai is
                        saying?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I do. Unfortunately, Kiryuuin, I never instructed Yamanaka to do
                        something like that. If a matter like this was made public, people wouldn&rsquo;t trust me any
                        more.
                        There&rsquo;s no merit in it for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about it. I know you always wanted to have a match with
                        me,
                        but I never accepted a year-three opponent. Didn&rsquo;t you begrudge me for that? Maybe you
                        even wanted to
                        stir things up and force me to fight with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like before, they aren&rsquo;t reaching an agreement.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was interested in a match with you. But, I already lost all my interest

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kiriyama-senpai, you&rsquo;re Kiryuuin-senpai&rsquo;s classmate.
                        You&rsquo;ve
                        also supported Nagumo-senpai as the Vice President for a long time. What do you think after
                        listening to
                        both parties?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita asked Kiriyama, whom she had chosen as a familiar third party.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand how Kiryuuin feels after being accused of shoplifting, but I
                        don&rsquo;t think Nagumo has anything to do with this matter. If Nagumo had really set her up,
                        he would have
                        chosen a better method.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re just overestimating Nagumo?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin put her hand on her waist and stirred Kiriyama on with a faint
                        smile.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thinking about the results Nagumo has shown in this school, it&rsquo;s
                        clear
                        that I&rsquo;m not overestimating him.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then why did Yamanaka-senpai try to do something like this? Even if she
                        did
                        build a grudge on Kiryuuin-senpai without being noticed, why did she try to pin the blame on
                        Nagumo-senpai?
                        What do you think about that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the truth, but it&rsquo;s hard to believe that Yamanaka
                        did
                        it on her own.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying she wasn&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamanaka&rsquo;s position is quite low among the year-three students. She
                        could have been manipulated by someone else in return for private points.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama&rsquo;s argument is that neither Nagumo or Yamanaka, but a third party,
                        is
                        lurking in the darkness.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s true, it means we need to move to identify the real
                        criminal.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but it&rsquo;s going to be difficult. When she was
                        forced
                        to confess by Kiryuuin, she still didn&rsquo;t tell the truth and gave out Nagumo&rsquo;s name.
                        She must
                        have quite the resolve to be able to do something like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you know why that is? Kushida-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita then asked Kushida, who had been listening up until now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As a year-three student, framing Nagumo-senpai is nothing but a
                        disadvantage
                        for Yamanaka-san. If she still mentioned his name&hellip; She must really want to protect the
                        real
                        culprit.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. This means that she is more afraid of them than she is
                        of
                        even Nagumo.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. Is there really anyone to be more afraid of than
                        Nagumo?
                        You just want me to believe that there&rsquo;s someone else, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Kiryuuin, who continues to suspect Nagumo, Kiriyama is just another person on
                        Nagumo&rsquo;s side, and her mistrust is only growing as he continues to insist that it is
                        difficult to name
                        the real culprit.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, aren&rsquo;t you just convincing yourself that I&rsquo;m the
                        culprit?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are no other candidates, so I have no choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please quiet down, you two. It&rsquo;s clear that there will be no
                        solution
                        from the two of you talking with each other.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she pointed out, the two will never reach an agreement.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kiriyama-senpai, how would you handle this matter?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think we should avoid any further inquiry into this case. However, what
                        Yamanaka did is an unforgivable act, even if it ended in only an attempt. Therefore, an apology
                        to Kiryuuin
                        and as much compensation as possible. These measures are acceptable, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s no need to report it to the
                        school?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Yamanaka committed the crime alone, we should report it. If we report
                        it
                        without finding the real culprit however, Yamanaka will bear all of the blame. Isn&rsquo;t that
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Even if the school does investigate, that doesn&rsquo;t
                        mean that the real culprit will come to light&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The conclusion is that Nagumo is innocent, but is this a reasonable
                        compromise?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want an apology from the real culprit, though?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like that&rsquo;s possible. Or are you saying you
                        can
                        get to the real culprit? I don&rsquo;t recall hearing anything new in the past few weeks. Or did
                        you get
                        some good information from Ansai, whom you threatened with acts of violence?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin shrugged after hearing Kiriyama, the former Vice President&rsquo;s
                        comment.

                        pressed.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-kun. You were in contact with Asahina-senpai the other day,

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here, Horikita turned to the topic I was asked about earlier. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Asahina&rsquo;s name was mentioned, who is close to Nagumo, Nagumo who had
                        been
                        asked to remain calm turned his gaze over to me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I heard about the circumstances of the year-three students from
                        Asahina-senpai. About the contract Nagumo-senpai forced onto the year-threes, and the
                        relationship they have
                        with each other. I tried to find out what kind of feelings they were harbouring for
                        Nagumo.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I received the report about that from Ayanokoji-kun before coming to the
                        Student Council room. He also learned a lot of details about Yamanaka-senpai while talking with
                        Asahina-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? As expected of Ayanokoji, I was right to count on him.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had already reported this to Kiryuuin, but she pretended that she was hearing
                        this
                        for the first time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you the one that moved Ayanokoji, Kiryuuin?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you have any complaints, Nagumo?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. But, in that case&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo was about to continue, but he quickly closed his mouth.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry. Please continue, Suzune. This is your first matter as the Student

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that he could not meet Yamanaka-senpai, but Ayanokoji-kun met
                        someone
                        in her place. Tachibana-senpai from the same year-three D Class. Why did he show up, even though
                        he should
                        be unrelated to this? It looks like it was to prevent Yamanaka-senpai from telling the

                        Tachibana-senpai. They received an instruction from Nagumo-senpai to put merchandise into
                        Kiryuuin-senpai&rsquo;s bag.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious, but I never told Tachibana to do something like that.
                        Actually, I don&rsquo;t even remember talking to him this month. The true culprit may be
                        Tachibana.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

                        contradiction.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One of them must be lying.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal to think so. However, I would like to believe what both
                        parties are saying.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would be difficult to believe contradictory statements.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nanase stopped writing and muttered.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Normally, yes. But what if both parties are really not lying?
                        Wouldn&rsquo;t
                        the contradiction disappear if some certain conditions were added in?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Horikita has come up with a possibility while they continued their
                        conversation.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The real culprit told Tachibana-senpai that this order was from
                        Nagumo-senpai.
                        Tachibana-senpai and Yamanaka-senpai believed this and kept insisting that the order was from
                        Nagumo.
                        However, the request was a criminal act. Normally, you would want to begin by directly meeting
                        with
                        Nagumo-senpai and confirming if it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s normal that one would want a guarantee that they would receive
                        something
                        in return.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, they didn&rsquo;t do that. Why is that? Could it be because this
                        person is someone worth trusting for Yamanaka-senpai and Tachibana-senpai? A spokesperson for
                        Nagumo-senpai,
                        and a person of power.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this school, there is only one person who can be described as such.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In this case, the one pulling the strings is not Nagumo-senpai, but
                        Kiriyama-senpai, the former Vice President. It&rsquo;s you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone turned their eyes towards Kiriyama-senpai.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me? Why would you reach that conclusion?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama calmly expressed his doubt about the fact that his name had come
                        up.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you not get it from the explanation just now? After collecting all the
                        information, this is the most likely conclusion.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no proof that the information Ayanokoji got is true. I have
                        a
                        guaranteed ticket to A Class from Nagumo. I would never do anything to oppose him.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this explanation, an unexpected person extended a helping hand to
                        Kiriyama.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think the Student Council President&rsquo;s reasoning is interesting,
                        but
                        Kiriyama is right. Here&rsquo;s the biggest reason I don&rsquo;t suspect Kiriyama: a
                        domesticated dog
                        isn&rsquo;t brave enough to threaten its master.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, may I call in Yamanaka-senpai and Tachibana-senpai as new witnesses
                        now?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita asked Nagumo to have him confirm.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Student Council President. You can do whatever you
                        want.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama interrupted them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do the witnesses know they will be called here?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I will contact them now and negotiate.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama glared at Horikita, and then at me, who was involved in this
                        case.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the theory that Kiriyama was the real culprit had not emerged, he might have
                        been
                        able to ride it out without attracting any attention.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, in order to clear up the suspicions that have emerged, a barrage of
                        questions is inevitable.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question is whether the two can hide Kiriyama&rsquo;s involvement without any
                        prior planning. It&rsquo;s not an easy thing to continue lying in this place.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there a problem with calling them here?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita asked Kiriyama.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they don&rsquo;t want to come into the light themselves, then we can just pull
                        them in.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s the fastest method that can be used.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why are you panicking, Kiriyama? You have nothing to do with it, so
                        there&rsquo;s no need to worry.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo told Kiriyama in a light manner.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was meaning behind his eyes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wasn&rsquo;t suspecting Kiriyama up until just now, but it looks like he
                        sensed
                        the winds changing.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...I understand. I&rsquo;ll end it here, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Realizing that there was no continuing this, said so as if he had given
                        up.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It means there is no need to call witnesses. I&rsquo;ll admit that it was
                        me
                        who instructed Tachibana.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize you were the culprit. May I ask why you did
                        something
                        like this?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps having already prepared for the worst, Kiriyama doesn&rsquo;t look to be
                        panicking.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I did something bad to you Kiryuuin, but with the objective I had, it
                        couldn&rsquo;t be anyone else.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be anyone else?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When I told Tachibana that it was an order by Nagumo to gather points,
                        Tachibana accepted immediately. He was in a rush since the second term was already about to end.
                        He
                        didn&rsquo;t even suspect anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coming from the Vice President Kiriyama, it&rsquo;s understandable that Tachibana
                        would believe it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is the plot of the lie. If you can frame Kiryuuin for shoplifting
                        without
                        her realizing it, you can get a ticket to A Class. If you fail, that is of course invalid, but
                        you still get
                        points.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a bold lie. If Yamanaka had succeeded, your lie would have been
                        exposed
                        immediately.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo&rsquo;s point is correct. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure Tachibana and Yamanaka would have gone to demand the reward
                        tickets
                        right away. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then the others around would quickly learn that Kiriyama was lying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in the same class for three years, so I know your
                        character
                        and abilities very well. I judged that it was impossible for someone on Yamanaka&rsquo;s level
                        to do this
                        unnoticed by you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason that it had to be Kiryuuin. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He selected a person with whom the planting would definitely fail.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you knew from the start that she would be discovered? But, I
                        don&rsquo;t
                        understand. This is all too elaborate to only make me angry, and it doesn&rsquo;t benefit
                        you.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The aim was to turn Kiryuuin-senpai into a shoplifter. We were mistaken
                        about
                        that idea itself.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nanase kept nodding as she continued writing down the record of
                        proceedings.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I knew that when you questioned Yamanaka and
                        Nagumo&rsquo;s name came up, I knew that you would first make an appointment with me to talk
                        directly to
                        Nagumo. I adjusted that appointment&rsquo;s timing to make it clash with another certain
                        appointment.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was present at that time too, I quickly realized Kiriyama&rsquo;s
                        objective.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Student Council election. Your objective was to shut it down before it
                        ever got started.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very good, Ayanokoji. I can see why Horikita-senpai counts on
                        you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Nagumo also understood Kiriyama&rsquo;s aim.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You wanted to put salt on Honami&rsquo;s wound about shoplifting and make
                        her
                        drop out.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I could have put out this problem of the past myself, but I figured
                        that
                        would be too weak. I calculated that Kiryuuin, who hates this type of crime, would stab her
                        merciless words
                        into Ichinose&rsquo;s heart who knew nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin lightly clapped with amazement.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like you really made me dance. You get me on this one,
                        Kiriyama.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under the pretense of coincidence, he used Kiryuuin to undermine Ichinose&rsquo;s
                        self-esteem and make her feel that she was unfit to be Student Council President. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiryuuin&rsquo;s abilities are as strong as those of Horikita Manabu, but she has
                        no
                        friends, so she is extremely vulnerable in terms of information warfare. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a strategy made by someone who knew everything about Nagumo and
                        Kiryuuin&rsquo;s characters.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The most unexpected thing was that Ichinose had already decided to leave
                        the
                        Student Council at that stage. If I had already known that, there would have been no need for me
                        to take
                        this risk. &ldquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita would have ended up winning even if he had not put out the shoplifting
                        case.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Kiriyama? What&rsquo;s the reason you went to all that risk to
                        control
                        the election?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get it, Nagumo? I had enough of your arbitrary decisions.
                        What
                        would have happened if the election went on as planned without Ichinose quitting the Student
                        Council? You
                        gambled a massive amount of private points just for the sake of your fight with Ayanokoji. And
                        you
                        wouldn&rsquo;t even have hesitated to buy votes with the points in order to win.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, Nagumo has a huge amount of money.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the fight was hard, it would not be surprising if he adopted a vote-buying
                        strategy.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. Why do you care about money when it&rsquo;s already
                        decided that you&rsquo;ve won?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do I care? It&rsquo;s true that I have gained a ticket to A Class.
                        However, do you know how mentally taxing it&rsquo;s all been? Envied and resented by my
                        classmates.
                        It&rsquo;s been unbearable.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama glared at Nagumo, showing a serious anger that he has never shown
                        before.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can increase the number of students that can move up to A Class if we
                        use
                        the points for them instead of your entertainment. But to put all those private points, soaked
                        in the blood
                        and sweat of the year-three students, in a fight just for your own desires? Give me a
                        break.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Preventing the unnecessary outflow of private points. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s Kiriyama&rsquo;s goal.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I had no idea, Kiriyama. I didn&rsquo;t know you were thinking about other
                        people. I thought all the people I&rsquo;ve given tickets to are self-centered, competent people
                        who only
                        care about graduating in A Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo praised Kiriyama, as if impressed by him.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether or not everyone will take this as praise is another matter.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Horikita-senpai and Ayanokoji. I&rsquo;m just displeased that you&rsquo;re
                        creating fights that are unnecessary for the year-three students.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand what you want to say, but you betrayed me, Kiriyama. Are you
                        prepared for the consequences?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo has the authority to revoke what he&rsquo;s given. The ticket will not
                        remain
                        in Kiriyama&rsquo;s hands after his defiance.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an action under the terms of the contract. Do whatever you
                        want.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave Kiriyama&rsquo;s punishment to Nagumo. That should be
                        enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After concluding so, Kiryuuin tried to leave the Student Council room right
                        away.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please wait, Kiryuuin-senpai. We haven&rsquo;t finished talking
                        yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought the Student Council President&#39;s turn to speak was over,
                        but?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. This is a matter relating to the Student Council. I
                        don&rsquo;t think you have the right to judge Kiriyama-senpai yourself. Besides, there&rsquo;s
                        another
                        puzzle left.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Puzzle? What else is there?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kiriyama-senpai tried to frame you for shoplifting. Then, he set it up so
                        that
                        you would discover it and come to the Student Council room. The aim was to stop the election. To
                        make
                        Ichinose-san recall her trauma and withdraw from the election.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the confession, this supposition is not incorrect.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, there would have been no need to take such a risk. If he really
                        wanted to stop the elections, there were plenty of other ways to do it. If he was going to use
                        the
                        shoplifting matter, he could secretly contact Ichinose and make her withdraw too. This would
                        have been safer
                        and more certain.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that Kiriyama didn&rsquo;t get that idea,
                        right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting interested again, Kiryuuin returned to her position.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The question of why he took this risk remains. Perhaps Kiriyama-senpai was
                        prepared to be found out as the real culprit here today?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama simply looked at the Student Council President Horikita without giving a
                        reply.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought that he wanted to make this matter public and raise a problem.
                        All
                        of the Student Council members are gathered here today, and so is Ayanokoji-kun. You told me
                        before that
                        this was all under Kiriyama-senpai&rsquo;s direction, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it was Kiryuuin who proposed the idea of appealing to the Student
                        Council,
                        but when Horikita asked her about it immediately after entering the room, she tilted her head,
                        which was
                        probably because it was Kiriyama&#39;s idea. It was also Kiriyama who urged her to talk so that
                        the question
                        would be swept under the rug.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Horikita. For a moment, I saw your presence overlapping with that of
                        Horikita-senpai, which is strange.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kiriyama praised her for her correct guess.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure how effective it would be, but that&rsquo;s about it.
                        The
                        number of students complaining about Nagumo is increasing day by day. I told him about it, but
                        he
                        didn&rsquo;t listen to me. Right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo said while not denying it, but rather as if confirming it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must have continued pushing that aside until now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think that he was very wrong in his ways, but this seems to have been
                        the
                        truth. Nagumo-senpai.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What will you do, Nagumo? Will you push the responsibility for this matter
                        caused by your own selfishness on Kiriyama alone?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I had thought that this had nothing to do with me, but I can see
                        after
                        hearing all this that I was wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was wondering what conclusion he would come to, but Nagumo moved his gaze from
                        Kiriyama to Horikita.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Reaching the truth of this matter is your achievement, Suzune. So, you
                        should
                        be the one to decide the punishment.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Are you really sure?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one sitting there, right? I&rsquo;ll obey your
                        decision.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What judgement will Horikita make after seeing all this?</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me speak as the Student Council President, then. First of all, I would
                        like Kiriyama-senpai to apologize deeply to Kiryuuin-senpai for this incident. Whatever the
                        circumstances
                        behind this, we should take seriously the fact that he tried to pin the crime on the unrelated
                        Yamanaka-senpai and Tachibana-senpai. However, as we cannot avoid this becoming a big deal if
                        reported to
                        the school, I would like him to reflect on this by voluntarily suspending himself from school
                        for a
                        week.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Student Council has no right to suspend or expel a student. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with such a judgement, the school side must also confirm it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s voluntary suspension.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can pretend to be sick or do whatever you want, just stay in your dorm and
                        reflect. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what Horikita is saying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Further, there is no direct responsibility with Nagumo-senpai, but I think
                        he
                        has a certain amount of responsibility for making the contract. I think you are entitled to
                        deprive
                        Kiriyama-senpai of his right to move to another class, but please promise not to do
                        so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bold request.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can refuse it if you want. You&rsquo;re going to follow my decisions
                        though, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really blame Kiriyama for this either. But is this really
                        it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. If it ends like this, the same thing may happen again. From now on,
                        please
                        use the points you&rsquo;ve collected from year-three students for their sake alone. I would
                        like to add in
                        that condition as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up until now, Nagumo would have done as he pleased from his own throne.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He must have used many private points without our knowledge and spent a lot of
                        money
                        playing around with Horikita Manabu and the other students. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The measure is to ban this from now on.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the will of the Student Council President, then I&rsquo;ll
                        follow it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was very easy, I didn&rsquo;t think you would accept these
                        conditions.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What Suzune, rather the Student Council President is saying is
                        fundamentally
                        correct, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe he was a better Student Council President than I thought he was.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will you really accept this, Nagumo? You have the power to cause my
                        downfall.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Student Council President&rsquo;s decision. It would be
                        foolish
                        to go against it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Nagumo was convinced by Kiriyama&#39;s true character.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you really intend to let this go with that?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I came to realize something as well. That I don&rsquo;t have fate on my
                        side.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nagumo said with an expression that looked like he had given up. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not continue talking, however. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, Kiriyama doesn&rsquo;t look convinced. He has something else on his mind.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looks like he&rsquo;s thinking about what&rsquo;s ahead.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The case is now resolved and closed. Please do not say anything else about
                        this incident.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the declaration of the Student Council President, this series of incidents
                        came
                        to resolution. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it is not clear whether or not this really is the end of everything.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was that meaningful expression on Kiriyama&rsquo;s face at the end?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.4f1mdlm"><span class="c20">Part 2</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Special Test was over and the closing ceremony of the second term finally
                        took
                        place the next day.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s speech in the gymnasium, the students
                        returned
                        to the class for a brief presentation of awards to those who had achieved outstanding results in
                        club
                        competitions, etc., and we were given precautions about the winter break. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, Chabashira-sensei announced the results of the Special Test. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After everyone held onto their breath, we were told that our class had won.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that moment, the students cheered a shout of joy that even echoed to the
                        neighbouring classes. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only 50 class points were awarded for each class win or loss. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we were able to gain a large amount of class points. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two messages reached my phone at almost the same time. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of them was a &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; from Ichinose, and the other
                        was&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Winter break is starting tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t overdo it from the first
                        day,
                        it&rsquo;s important to cool down your head after all this work.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While still overjoyed, the students were told so by Chabashira-sensei and
                        dismissed.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chabashira-sensei also smiled as she left the classroom. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As previously noted, this Special Test is set up so that everyone can find out in
                        detail who solved which questions and how many questions they solved correctly. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, the order in which the test was taken and the amount of time spent
                        are
                        also disclosed. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at this, not only can one see which students have worked the hardest, but
                        you
                        can also see each class&rsquo; strategy. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is sure to be useful as data both for allies and rivals. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can check the information on our phones, so I should slowly check over all the
                        details later. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I left the cheering students behind and exited the classroom ahead of the
                        others.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kei has been looking at me from the start.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I still haven&rsquo;t been contacted by Kei since losing my chance the other
                        day.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that she&rsquo;s been staring at me probably suggests that she is trying
                        to
                        make contact, though. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be hard to talk in a crowded place, so we should move somewhere else.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She doesn&rsquo;t know how I will move, so Kei is still indecisive. &nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s no use continuing this estrangement as this will not cause her to grow
                        up.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that in mind, I was leaving the classroom, but&hellip;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you leaving alone?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Horikita, not Kei, who chased after me as I went out into the
                        corridor.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you should be here? The person who played a leading role in
                        our
                        victory shouldn&rsquo;t leave so quickly.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back in a bit. I wanted to talk to you for a little
                        bit.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying so, Horikita caught up with me and started walking. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t see a bag in her hands, so I suppose she will be returning to the
                        classroom after this.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You used an interesting strategy in this Special Test.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if my method was the most efficient one or not,
                        though.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita&rsquo;s strategy. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was to make Keisei the first batter to challenge the problems. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is one of the top students in the entire grade with A in Academic Ability.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was asked to solve the minimum number of two problems as quickly as possible
                        and
                        to use the remaining time to read the remaining questions. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The aim was to have the waiting student with low Academic Ability solve the
                        simpler
                        problems. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A strategy to alternate between students with high and low Academic Ability.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this strategy normally cannot be used, as conversations were forbidden
                        during the test. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things like phones or not also could not be used. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you ask whether there were no gaps at all, the answer would be a no.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While a student was solving problems, the next student in line waited in the
                        corridor. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means that there is a short moment where they can meet when leaving the
                        classroom. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are two entrances into the classroom, so there is a distance when one of
                        them
                        is being used as an entrance and the other as an exit, but Horikita &nbsp;came up with a way to
                        deal with
                        it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All they needed was to see each other for a split moment.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question to be solved was conveyed with two-handed hand signs at that time.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the 55th question, two hands with five fingers are shown, for the 69th
                        question,
                        six fingers are shown with both hands, and then nine fingers are shown again while raising your
                        hands up.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of the rules, one cannot talk about the problems, but Horikita had
                        confirmed
                        beforehand that it wasn&rsquo;t a violation of the rules to use hand signs. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Using hand signs to show which problem to solve isn&rsquo;t rule-breaking
                        conduct,
                        and the rule of not talking was protected. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this, the students with low Academic Learning were able to save some time
                        and
                        quickly get to solving the problems instead of searching for them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was pretty close, though. Sakayanagi-san&rsquo;s class did great
                        too&hellip; We have a lot of students with low Academic Ability, so they couldn&rsquo;t win, but
                        they had
                        more correct answers.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Horikita Class had 72% of the questions answered correctly, while the
                        Sakayanagi
                        Class had 86%.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Under the same conditions, if it was a pure test of scores, this means that
                        Horikita
                        would have lost.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s dissatisfied. She still lost, even though she
                        did
                        what she needed to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She always ranked first in the midterm and written tests, and she proved that
                        again
                        this time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if we had fewer correct answers, a win is a win. There&rsquo;s no
                        need to
                        be disappointed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita Class is the one that gained class points, and Sakayanagi Class is the
                        one
                        that lost them. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, there&rsquo;s no mistaking the fact that 72% is still impressive.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not disappointed or anything, of course. It was just
                        frustrating.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looks like I didn&rsquo;t need to say that. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that her sense of rivalry was far beyond her disappointment.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Karuizawa-san seems a bit down lately. She has been studying
                        properly, but did something happen?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing. If I had to say something, it may be that we are in something
                        like a
                        cold war.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call that nothing. It&rsquo;s rare to see you guys
                        fight.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;These things can happen when a woman and a man have been together for a
                        long
                        time. This is a good experience too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps not liking my answer, Horikita frowned with confusion.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if she was able to get results in the studying sessions
                        and
                        the test in such an uncertain mental condition.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I might say that she was so mentally driven that she devoted herself to
                        studying, which she hates, but&hellip; Karuizawa-san&rsquo;s morale easily affects the class.
                        You should
                        make up with her soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She probably wants to see the class in a stable manner as the leader, but&hellip;
                        oh
                        well.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw Horikita off to the classroom and decided to leave.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.2u6wntf"><span class="c20">Part 3</span></h3>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This Special Test and Horikita&rsquo;s victory over Sakayanagi would soon become
                        a
                        major topic of discussion. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though it was not a purely academic contest, but one that included an
                        element of
                        inferior students in the OAA overthrowing their superiors, the fact remains that we won a direct
                        confrontation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gap between the Sakayanagi and Horikita classes was reduced by 100 points
                        before
                        the final test. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, the Ryuuen Class had a tough time. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They tried to disrupt the competition since they could not win by Academic
                        Learning,
                        but Ichinose calmly accepted the situation and firmly got the win. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked mentally unstable, considering her resigning from the Student Council
                        as
                        well, but she did not break.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, I can&rsquo;t say that Ryuuen&rsquo;s judgement was wrong. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Horikita who had built up a solid foundation, the Ryuuen class was lacking
                        in
                        this aspect and it would have been difficult for them to catch up after a short period of
                        studying.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After gaining this difficult victory, Ichinose Class still has a chance of making
                        it
                        to A Class, and the battle between the four classes will be carried over to the third term and
                        beyond.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I put on my shoes at the entrance and walked out of the school building, I
                        already had someone waiting for me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for troubling you on the last day of school.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person who contacted me directly after the results were announced. Sakayanagi
                        from year-two Class A.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear that Ichinose would be coming too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t think that the two people who messaged me would be in the same
                        place.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is going on here, Sakayanagi-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Ichinose hadn&rsquo;t been told about me either, and had a curious
                        expression.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk for a while, we&rsquo;ll stand out if we stay
                        here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There will be a lot of students passing by the entrance here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First, Ayanokoji-kun. Congratulations on your win in this Special
                        Test.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks, but we barely made it. We would have lost if it was a normal
                        written
                        test.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you talking about the percentage of correct answers? That&rsquo;s
                        another
                        matter. There&rsquo;s no changing the fact that I lost, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t being modest, but rather she earnestly accepted the results of
                        having done everything she could have done. I can see the leeway of A Class here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And it was very impressive how you defeated Ryuuen-kun,
                        Ichinose-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We just did what we should have done. I didn&rsquo;t do anything
                        special.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was impressed by the fact that you did not yield to Ryuuen-kun and the
                        others. To be honest, in my initial estimation, I thought it was 50-50. However, you actually
                        ended up
                        winning an overwhelming victory. It&rsquo;s probably a result of the leader calmly giving
                        precise
                        instructions.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi also seems to have read that Ichinose was fighting in a very focused
                        manner.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She evaluated the win as not one brought just by the difference in Academic
                        Learning,
                        but also by her calm demeanour.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really? Well, I am happy to be complimented by you,
                        Sakayanagi-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become very positive, Ichinose-san. I think that something
                        happened to you recently.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she&rsquo;s called me here, then it&rsquo;s possible she knows something.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi can&rsquo;t collect information herself because of her leg, so
                        I&rsquo;m
                        sure she always has students under her control working for her web of information.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day off we spent at the gym. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our going and returning. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day she waited in front of my room. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Any of these things could have been witnessed by someone.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you about something similar on the boat, do you
                        remember?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi said to Ichinose, instead of me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That I might get a painful push back if I&#39;m obsessed too much with one
                        thing. Right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The reason I invited you both here today is to tell
                        you
                        that. I&rsquo;m here to give an ultimatum to Ichinose-san, who has a faint crush on
                        Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like she already knows Ichinose has feelings for me, but that in itself
                        is
                        not surprising.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You should distance yourself from Ayanokoji-kun right now.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your ultimatum?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, I would have expected to see some unrest after Ichinose was told this
                        by a
                        third party here, but she showed no such signs.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. Why do I have to distance myself from Ayanokoji-kun?
                        No
                        matter what kind of feelings I have, there&rsquo;s no problem with being in contact with him as
                        a
                        friend.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You may be right, if that&rsquo;s really all it is. However, from what
                        I&rsquo;ve seen, it doesn&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;ll be satisfied with that.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can analyze things how you want. But, as long as Ayanokoji-kun
                        doesn&rsquo;t have any complaints, I&rsquo;m not going to change my current way of
                        thinking.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The erosion has already progressed. You&rsquo;re almost under his control.
                        Do
                        you realize that if this continues, you will eventually destroy yourself?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahahaha. That&rsquo;s a very funny thing to say.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seriously worried. I can&rsquo;t stand to see you fall into
                        depths
                        from which there is no saving you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about me, Sakayanagi-san. I&rsquo;m not
                        being
                        controlled or anything by Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never knew she could make such cold eyes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose then came next to me with an expression I had never seen before.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sakayanagi-san. Your thoughts are transparent. You want to control me and
                        use
                        me for your own convenience, don&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re trying to restrain
                        me like
                        this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. It can be analyzed in that way too, I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And one more thing. You actually think that Ayanokoji-kun is a special
                        person
                        too, and my presence has become an obstacle. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Ichinose smiled, Sakayanagi&rsquo;s movement stopped for a moment. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s rare for Sakayanagi to be upset like this, who always stood one notch
                        above Ichinose in every situation she&rsquo;s faced.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I certainly look at him in a special way too, but it&rsquo;s not the same
                        as
                        you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who knows? I think it is, even if you don&rsquo;t realize
                        it.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose confronted Sakayanagi&rsquo;s denial head-on.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine. If you&rsquo;re going that far, there&rsquo;s nothing else for me to
                        say
                        here. Don&rsquo;t ask me for help if you regret this later.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi concluded, but she must be even more cautious now after hearing
                        Ichinose&rsquo;s words. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must have thought that it would be good for her if Ichinose starts acting
                        rashly
                        because of her love, but things have begun to change. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The virtue she directed inwards hasn&rsquo;t changed, and the virtue she directed
                        outwards has completely changed into evil. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ichinose Class which has been sinking up until now is strong enough to
                        counter-attack.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi must have felt that. Why do I think so? Because I&rsquo;m being made
                        to
                        think that way right now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a victory party at Keyaki Mall after this. Can I
                        return to my dorm now?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;re probably going to meet up after changing clothes, so Ichinose
                        replied
                        so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It would be thoughtless to keep you here any longer,
                        so.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose waved at me and headed for the dorms.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I and Sakayanagi were the only ones left behind.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never thought I would be re-evaluating Ichinose-san in this
                        way.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that Sakayanagi hadn&rsquo;t noticed the change until now either.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A side-effect, no, a byproduct of a powerful medicine.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, because Ichinose-san, who has earned the trust of
                        others,
                        would have done excellent work for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You missed the point.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have a broad perspective and make calculations in moving people around, but
                        there
                        are still areas that even I do not fully understand. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The concept of love has the potential to affect someone&rsquo;s reasoning and
                        nature.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it can easily cause the unexpected. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but it is certainly one of the most mysterious
                        feelings
                        there is. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is Honami Ichinose suited to be a leader, or not? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is she a good adviser, or not? </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a different topic than that. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose&rsquo;s specs were never low in the first place. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I remember that the way she conducted herself during the Zodiac Test was also
                        impressive. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She has the potential to oppose Horikita, Ryuuen, and even Sakayanagi. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Depending on the situation, she might surprisingly even surpass them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I could not see what kind of hidden talent she had. However, that
                        doesn&rsquo;t matter if she gets carried away by her own power. The consequences will be
                        disastrous.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you thought you could stop that from happening?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I never had any intention of stopping her. The only thing that&rsquo;s
                        changed is who will break her.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi naturally doesn&rsquo;t see Ichinose as an ally.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She would have used her as a convenient pawn and gotten rid of her after her role
                        was
                        done.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I will be visiting your room &ldquo;too&rdquo; soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi, who had a grasp on information about Ichinose, deliberately revealed
                        her
                        hand, much like in a game of poker, in reply.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
