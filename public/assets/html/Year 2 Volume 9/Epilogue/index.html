    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c21 c33"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day after the closing ceremony of the second term.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Special Test is over and the students&rsquo; long awaited vacation is about to
            arrive.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though it isn&rsquo;t a long vacation like the summer vacation, it&rsquo;s still
            a happy time for most students. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their hard work of studying day and night was rewarded with a direct win against A
            Class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The students will certainly enjoy their winter vacation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone thought so, except one student in the class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she sighed with melancholy, Kei Karuizawa, the only exception, was at the Keyaki
            Mall with her best friend Satou Maya. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s always been good at putting on airs, and remained calm at school and
            studied hard even after her fight with Ayanokoji. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of that, the people around had no way of knowing that she was still troubled.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her best friend Satou was one of them, but she still noticed that the two were
            unusually distant recently.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, she thought that it was to focus on studies rather than because of a fight,
            so she hadn&rsquo;t followed it up until this day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haa&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sighing so much. The studies are over, so we should be having fun
            now. What happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? Really? Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa, who had been trying to avoid being noticed up to this point, found herself
            repeatedly sighing, perhaps unknowingly, as she relaxed after her studies, tests, and other areas she was
            not good at.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really, really.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa firmly replied, but Satou still had her doubts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is going to be a thoughtless question, but weren&rsquo;t you intending on
            making plans with Ayanokoji-kun?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean, our break is starting tomorrow. Normally, you&rsquo;d be hanging out
            together, right? Shinohara-san and Ike-kun also happily told me arm in arm that they were going to the
            movies.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pointed out that it was strange for Karuizawa to invite her and not have any
            other plans.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Karuizawa felt that she had failed, the reason she was showing this attitude
            was because somewhere in her heart, she wanted to ask Satou for advice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa nodded and walked past the caf&eacute;, which was starting to get
            crowded.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat down together on a bench near the resting corner on the second floor of the
            Keyaki Mall.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Maya-chan. I need some advice&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure. Totally fine with me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t displeased, but rather enthusiastic, as she had been waiting for
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think my relationship with Kiyotaka is in a bit of a tough
            spot&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-huh!?Really!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa revealed her pent-up feelings after carefully checking that no one was
            around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou was startled, not expecting this bomb to be dropped. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems that she didn&rsquo;t overreact on purpose, and started composing herself
            again while clearing her throat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your relationship is in a tough spot&hellip; You mean you could be breaking
            up?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll happen, but&hellip; but&hellip; These days,
            I can&rsquo;t help but think that it might.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her expression was surprisingly serious, and Satou choked on her words, unable to
            hide her shock.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, she wisely tried to find the right words to avoid making the atmosphere even
            heavier.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You and Ayanokoji-kun had a fight. But you couldn&rsquo;t make up and
            it&rsquo;s been going on for a while, was it really that bad of a fight?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A minor quarrel would probably take a few hours at most to clear up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa had a serious expression. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou had been thinking that the two always got along, so she could not hide her
            confusion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought it was a small fight, but maybe it wasn&rsquo;t so for
            Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa sighed with melancholy and nodded quietly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t talked since that fight?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa told her that it wasn&rsquo;t yesterday or today that they had the
            fight.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did not want to talk about it just yet though, and didn&rsquo;t touch on its
            causes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s winter break already, right? And I studied hard like Kiyotaka told
            me to and solved 3 out of 4 questions in the test. So, I thought that would be enough&hellip; That&rsquo;s
            why I tried to talk to him after the Special Test yesterday, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Horikita-san showed up. They were called by Nagumo-senpai. I wanted to talk to
            him after the ending ceremony today, but Horikita-san showed up again, so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The repeated pauses caused Satou to push her forehead.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you didn&rsquo;t get to talk at all in the end, and now we&rsquo;re
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-kun didn&rsquo;t look mad, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always expressionless, and his attitude never
            changes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This also dulled Karuizawa&rsquo;s judgement. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he had shown a blatantly angry reaction, she could have apologized earlier.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way, but aren&rsquo;t fights really
            common?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a word that pops up regularly among girls who are particularly excited to
            talk about their own love lives, and is not that uncommon in and of itself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, most fights aren&rsquo;t fights at all, but just minor problems that make
            things awkward. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou wanted to make sure that this fight did not fall under that category, but she
            could not step into it right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, come on, everyone has fights. I can&rsquo;t even imagine Ayanokoji-kun
            being angry, but&hellip; Was he angry when it happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hesitantly asked, but Karuizawa quickly shook her head no.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was the one who got angry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, yes, I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou thought that she was about to hear something unexpected, but she quickly
            dismissed that idea.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So the situation is that you are one-sidedly angry at him?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that&rsquo;s the case, the way to end the fight is simple.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou thought that things would go back to normal if Karuizawa just forgives
            Ayanokoji with a smile.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; not really it, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking&hellip; Can you tell me what the fight was
            about?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She can&rsquo;t get a better understanding without knowing this point. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa trusted that Satou was asking earnestly and decided to tell her how the
            fight started. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything started one Saturday night, when she invited him to go shopping for
            Christmas presents. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she found out that Ayanokoji was going with Ichinose on their day off, she
            became irritated. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn&rsquo;t believe that there was a good reason behind it. After hearing the
            circumstances, Satou quietly closed her mouth. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then strongly tapped both of her knees with the palms of her hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; It&rsquo;s definitely Ayanokoji-kun&rsquo;s fault!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou put forth her genuine thoughts and opinions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;R-right!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Satou on her side, Kei&rsquo;s expression became a little more cheery.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. If he has a girlfriend, he shouldn&rsquo;t go out on the weekend
            with someone else, no matter the circumstances! Or at the very least, he should have you or another boy or
            girl with him!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s right to get angry. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, she should be angry.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He shamelessly met up with Ichinose-san&hellip; and didn&rsquo;t even tell you
            what they did&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">How uneasy did Karuizawa feel when she first heard about this?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite that, she was able to continue focusing on her studies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ichinose-san isn&rsquo;t&hellip; she isn&rsquo;t dating anyone,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sense of unease that she cannot handle on her own.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone. Karuizawa said these words from the hope that Ichinose was dating someone
            else.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...I don&rsquo;t think so. She&rsquo;s pretty popular in school, so it would
            be known right away if she was dating someone, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa cast her eyes down after confirming what she already knew.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uggh!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou couldn&rsquo;t help but hug her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Maya-chan!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Thanks. But, I&rsquo;m at fault here too. If I had listened to Kiyotaka and
            understood him better&hellip; things would have ended without a fight.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could have just smiled and said let&rsquo;s go shopping for Christmas presents
            next week. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She regretted not doing so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Satou&rsquo;s point of view, Karuizawa is cute. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is one of the top girls in terms of pure looks.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she first enrolled in the school, there was a time when she was an unimportant
            girl coveting Hirata&rsquo;s attention, and there was even a time Satou hated her for always trying to
            assert dominance with her annoying personality. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, now that Satou fell in love with the same person, she can understand her.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou can now sense that Karuizawa has a cute personality behind her stubbornness.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou can confidently say that even if another girl were to aim for Ayanokoji, there
            is no way Karuizawa would lose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it&rsquo;s a different story if the other girl is Ichinose Honami. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Ichinose had feelings for Ayanokoji, there&rsquo;s no way to eliminate the
            possibility that Ayanokoji may switch from Karuizawa to Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey. Should we ask about it to the people in Ichinose-san Class?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s the scary possibility of seeing something she doesn&rsquo;t want to
            see, but as things are, even if she makes up with Ayanokoji after this, the same sense of worry and anxiety
            will be repeated again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she can learn that Ichinose has no such intentions-</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s g&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, no, nevermind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa&rsquo;s anxiety still got to her, and she declined Satou&rsquo;s
            offer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then vigorously stood up, as if to shake off this bad feeling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. I&rsquo;m not gonna think about it anymore. Let&rsquo;s have some fun
            now, I&rsquo;m going to see Kiyotaka tonight. We&rsquo;ll definitely make up then!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit! I&rsquo;m rooting for you!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After laughing together, the phone in Karuizawa&rsquo;s hand vibrated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, she thought it was from Ayanokoji, and she happily opened her
            chat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa&rsquo;s expression froze as she stopped to look at the screen of her
            phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou quickly looked over at her with concern.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kei-chan?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; however, continued to look at the screen as if time
            had stopped. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wondering what was going on, Satou stole a glance at the screen from
            Karuizawa&rsquo;s side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she saw the screen, she was as stiff as Karuizawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-who is that from?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From Nene-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The picture that came along with the message from Mori Nene was the two that were
            being talked about just now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was from when Ayanokoji and Ichinose were chatting while leaving the gym.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The entrance to the gym, where the two in front of the bench can be clearly seen from
            the front.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what date is this from?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...I&rsquo;ll ask.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she hurriedly checked with Mori via chat, she found out that it was the evening
            before yesterday.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s when Karuizawa and the others were having their last study session with
            Horikita and the others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They, they were probably just in the same place by coincidence,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou desperately replied, but it&rsquo;s obvious that they left the gym
            together.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does Ayanokoji-kun go to the gym?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, Karuizawa-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if putting salt on the wound, she was called out to by Ichinose in front of the
            gym.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose is in her private clothes, probably having returned to change her clothes
            already.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, did you come to the gym?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, umm&hellip; We just happened to be here&hellip; right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou repeated herself while following up from Ichinose and said that they were
            resting on a bench.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh. I thought you started going to the gym with Ayanokoji.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose replied with a usual smile, as if it was only natural that she would
            know.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...You already knew that Kiyotaka was going to the gym, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa turned the screen off and put her phone in her pocket.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been going to the gym too, so. It looks like Ayanokoji-kun
            took a liking to it after I told him about it and we went together. He said that he&rsquo;ll be starting
            too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa muttered with an indistinct voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you going to the gym now Ichinose-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We won the Special Test, so I&rsquo;m going to celebrate with my classmates. I
            forgot something when I came to the gym the other day, so I thought I&rsquo;d stop by and pick it
            up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose said with a smile.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Ichinose-san. Is it true that you met up with Ayanokoji the other day
            with just the two of you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Figuring that she had to be the one to ask if Karuizawa wouldn&rsquo;t, Satou boldly
            asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ichinose-san&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing between you and Ayanokoji-kun,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way. There&rsquo;s nothing between Ayanokoji-kun and I.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She lightly waved her hand and declined, saying that it was unthinkable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satou&rsquo;s suspicions were not cleared however, and she became more determined
            towards pursuing the matter. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa tried to stop her by pulling on her cuff, but her opposition wasn&rsquo;t
            strong enough.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mhm. I wouldn&rsquo;t lie about something like that. He just gave me some
            advice about my class. &hellip;Did I cause a misunderstanding?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose was uncomfortable after seeing Karuizawa&rsquo;s uneasy expression and Satou
            glaring at her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I did think that you might be displeased about it, but&hellip; I&rsquo;m
            sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose bowed her head with an apologetic expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing this, Karuizawa also came up with the courage to put her thoughts into
            words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...So, Kanzaki-kun?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karuizawa naturally put out the name Kanzaki. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose had no idea, but she could deduce the situation just by hearing that
            name.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Our class was down to D Class and we were up against the wall. We
            didn&rsquo;t have the strength to rebuild ourselves and suffered. Ayanokoji couldn&rsquo;t bear to see that
            happen, and said he would try to do something about it to help us. Maybe you&rsquo;ve also heard the name
            Mako-chan?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean Amikura-san? I don&rsquo;t know about that, but&hellip; I did hear of
            Himeno-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As her suspicion of Ichinose and Ayanokoji started fading, Karuizawa&rsquo;s tone
            lightened as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Himeno-san was also helping us rebuild the class. We discussed it
            together with her. Other people know about this too, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose didn&rsquo;t seem to know much about it, but she told so to Karuizawato put
            her mind at ease.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, I don&rsquo;t understand why Kiyotaka wants to save your
            class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. He must have some weird reason for it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still not completely clearing up their suspicions, the two faced each other and spoke
            their concerns.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Ichinose nodded and closed her eyes for a moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an alignment of interests.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alignment, of interests?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been struggling lately because we haven&rsquo;t been able to win.
            We were in a pinch where the gap between us and A Class would grow even further if we lost against
            Ryuuen-kun. I think Ayanokoji thought it would benefit him more if the stronger class, the Ryuuen Class,
            lost, instead of a weak class like us.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the most convincing answer as to why Ayanokoji supported a rival class.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He momentarily aided them in order to defeat the bigger devil.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s really, really nothing going on between you and Kiyotaka,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have nothing to be guilty of.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With straight eyes, Ichinose clearly asserted that there was nothing to be jealous
            of.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing how honest her attitude seemed, Karuizawa and Satou could do nothing but nod
            again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s also Ayanokoji-kun&rsquo;s fault for not communicating
            properly with his girlfriend, who should be very important to him. But if I&rsquo;m the one that caused a
            rift between you two, I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility to make things right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s okay. I understand the circumstances now, so I think we can
            make up today! Thanks for taking the trouble, Ichinose-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about it. Let me know if you ever need help with
            something again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose kindly said so and watched on as the two walked away from the gym.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose muttered so, and continued.</span></p>

    <h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.nmf14n"><span class="c20">Part 1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first day of winter break. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sky was covered in thick clouds and it&rsquo;s been raining since the
            morning.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">About 10 minutes past the appointed time, Ryuuen approached with an umbrella. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose, who had been waiting from earlier, quietly stared at Ryuuen&rsquo;s
            face.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen stopped at a distance where they could hear each other through the
            rain.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The weather&rsquo;s always like this recently, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without even a word about Ryuuen&rsquo;s late arrival, Ichinose started
            speaking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you gonna complain about me being late?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I was ready to wait for 30 minutes. If you hadn&rsquo;t
            shown up, I would have left without hesitation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose replied with a relaxed attitude, and seemed to care more about the weather
            than she did about Ryuuen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tilted her umbrella and looked up at the rainy sky for a moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll be like this all day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How friendly and good-natured of you to go to the trouble of answering my
            call.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen said, ignoring Ichinose&rsquo;s mutterings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you understand the meaning of the word
            &ldquo;friend&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s normal to answer when you&rsquo;re called. I didn&rsquo;t have any
            plans right now anyway. So, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My plans got messed up a little. I want to know why.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Special Test? Your harassment didn&rsquo;t work as planned,
            huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You might think that it&#39;s uninspired for me to do something similar again,
            but it suits my pawns. If it&#39;s the easiest and most effective way, why not repeat it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen instructed his classmates to relentlessly pressure and interfere with
            Ichinose&rsquo;s classmates. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would force their way into classrooms, libraries, karaoke rooms and other places
            where the students from Ichinose Class gathered for study sessions, and interfere with their studies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayanokoji and the others had no way of knowing, but Ryueen was also doing more
            dangerous things. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would offer money to students with high Academic Ability and pay them if they got
            a question wrong, or threaten them that it would be troubling for their peers if they answered all the
            questions correctly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strategy was based on the idea that even a class with high solidarity can be
            penetrated if they are weakened.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that it was annoying for everyone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this did not result in a large amount of damage in the end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a match of Academic Ability where the gap is already large, Ryuuen has a faint
            chance of winning even with a frontal attack. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s precisely because he understood this that he planned to fight and defeat
            his opponents from another direction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, did you actually think you could win that way?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I did.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it came down to it however, none of his strategies worked on Ichinose and her
            class.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to give you my honest praise this time, Ichinose. I thought
            your class would collapse after something like that, but you&rsquo;ve definitely grown up a lot since
            year-one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reports from Ishizaki and the others working under Ryuuen said that their
            sabotaging of the Ichinose Class was a success. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although no students had accepted the bribes or the threats, they still seemed to be
            agitated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Ichinose and the other students were only showing outward signs of being
            troubled. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind the scenes, however, they were steadily making time for their studies and
            pretending to be frightened by the threats on purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did someone give you some wisdom? In the past, you would have easily stopped
            the secret study sessions and shut yourself in. But you went to the trouble of making it look like our
            strategy was working.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised if this was Sakayanagi or Ayanokoji.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, he would have considered making an even stronger move as a natural
            countermeasure.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cornered rat bites the cat. Is this the counterattack of a cornered
            weakling?</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen invited Ichinose out here to confirm this directly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one gave me wisdom, Ryuuen-kun. We just continued studying while suffering
            through the noise. The threats really were scary for everyone. We just happened to not fall
            apart.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for modesty here. It&rsquo;s obvious something has
            changed in your class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the direct cause of your defeat. You should have taken the
            test seriously, like us and the other classes. You should have studied and scored points. That&rsquo;s how
            Horikita-san and the others beat Sakayanagi-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking so high and might just because you picked up a win in an
            advantageous test. Well, this Special Test was an extremely tepid one. We just moved our arms with pen in
            hand, with no risk of anyone dropping out. The heat wasn&rsquo;t high enough for me to get
            serious.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have used the normal methods that everyone else
            did?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There would be no improvement even after teaching these idiots for a week or
            two. I just decided that it would be easier to bring the others down instead.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the rain continued, Ryuuen laughed while meeting eyes with Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That decision was a mistake though, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We got done in by some fellows whose only saving grace is their honesty, but
            I&rsquo;ll conduct a grander interference next time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t intend to change the way you do things even if the same test
            was repeated again, do you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll bring you down outside the
            tests.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen proudly replied that this was their way of doing things.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. I guess we&rsquo;re not going to agree on anything, no matter what I
            say.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were able to temporarily return to C Class by a narrow margin. But
            don&rsquo;t think you can win again just because of that. You&#39;re a pathetic sheep, already stuck in the
            swamp. No matter how much you struggle in the mud, no, the more you struggle, the deeper you sink.
            That&rsquo;s your destiny, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been losing so much lately, so that sounds painfully
            true.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it again, but you were only saved by the content of this
            Special Test.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen had his own aim in persistently clashing with Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He believed that he could see through the other party by arguing in this way. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, he could not. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gaps that Ichinose would have shown in the past were not there at all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The class you&rsquo;re going to face in the Final Test is Ayanokoji&rsquo;s
            class. That class is a nuisance, you know? Even more so than Sakayanagi, whom I plan to destroy. In other
            words, defeat is inevitable for you. It&rsquo;s not just me, I&rsquo;m sure Sakayanagi and the others also
            think so. By the end of the school year, you&rsquo;re going to be finished.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryueen pressured Ichinose to give up her hopes by saying that this win doesn&rsquo;t
            mean anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without an immediate reply, Ichinose stood still and listened to him talk.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great for Ayanokoji and his class. They don&rsquo;t have to deal
            with me or Sakayanagi, but instead get to fight the small fry and obtain a lot of class points. I
            can&rsquo;t believe how lucky they are.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring her lack of response, Ryuuen relentlessly attacked Ichinose, trying to push
            her into a corner.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. If we lose in the final test, that may be it for
            us.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If an even bigger gap than there is now opens up in a direct confrontation, it would
            be almost impossible to make up for it in 1 year.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the way to graduate in A Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there a way to do that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the end of the final test, the road to A Class will be closed for you. In
            which case, the only other option you have will be to collect private points to graduate in A
            Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would take an unbelievable amount of money to save 40 people. I don&rsquo;t
            think that&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t save everyone, but what about just one? Just 20 million
            points. You can collect money from your class for a good cause. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d entrust you with
            10 or 20 million. You can just use that money in the end.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s an embezzlement if I use the money that everyone entrusted me with to
            move to another class. The school won&rsquo;t approve it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s true that if someone like me or Sakayanagi does
            the same thing, we&rsquo;ll be punished. We would be expelled without question. But, I don&rsquo;t think it
            will be the same for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good-natured person, so they will sympathize with you and
            understand your feelings. Even if you&rsquo;ve embezzled the funds, tell the school that they gave it to you
            on their own. If no one sues you, it&rsquo;s not an embezzlement. I can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s 100%,
            but it&rsquo;s a good chance to get to A Class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very interesting, but I think I&rsquo;ve had enough
            already.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose, who now knew the reason for the invitation, had no reason to stay any
            longer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think I should leave now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was going to play with Suzune or Sakayanagi after this, but if there&rsquo;s
            a fight where expulsion is possible, your class will also be my target. I&rsquo;ll erase all of your friends
            that you&rsquo;ve desperately been trying to protect.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a half-bluff. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Ryuuen&rsquo;s point of view, Ichinose is not yet recognized as an
            obstacle.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a threat with a warning to keep Ichinose in check.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing the threat face on, Ichinose smiled.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just stop you before you can do that, then. I&rsquo;ll just get you
            expelled from school if I have to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh. You think you can get rid of me, or anyone else for that
            matter?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose may be a good-natured person, but she hates it when others get hurt.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This has been the impression of her from not only Ryuuen but also everyone else
            around her for the past two years.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve come a long way by just being able to lie
            shamelessly.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised that you&rsquo;re so chatty with me. I&rsquo;m not someone
            you or Sakayanagi-san should be worried about. Just like you said, I have no future. You shouldn&rsquo;t
            care about me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thick clouds covered the sky and the sound of rain became stronger.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before long, the smile on Ryuuen&rsquo;s face faded as he pondered Ichinose&rsquo;s

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman in front of him was not worth the trouble. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought he was treating her as such.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After cooling off, he realized that he&rsquo;d been rather insistent about
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t show anyone mercy from now on. I&rsquo;m going to use any means
            to win.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like you at all, even as a bluff.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just realized that I have no time to worry about it any more. That&rsquo;s
            all there is to it, really.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A reckless idea quietly faded away from Ryuuen&rsquo;s mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t show anyone mercy, huh? It seems that you&rsquo;ve been very
            attached to Ayanokoji lately. If that&rsquo;s the case, isn&rsquo;t the first thing you need to take care of
            Karuizawa&rsquo;s existence?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just a joke. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A usual harassment from Ryuuen to upset Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was about it, but Ichinose continued to softly smile.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Attached?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This school is a small place, rumours spread quickly.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen was already aware of the increase in contact between the two after gathering
            information.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had some guesses about Ichinose&rsquo;s one-sided feelings too, and he was sure
            that he was right.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you act more selfishly without restraining yourself?
            I&rsquo;ll help you get rid of Karuizawa if you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Impatience, rage, frustration or disgust.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Show whatever feelings you have. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the agitation Ryuuen was aiming for.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you know about it too. There&rsquo;s no need to hide it then, I
            guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose, still faintly smiling, looked into Ryuuen&rsquo;s eyes and replied without
            hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to expel Karuizawa just because of my personal feelings.
            That&rsquo;s a different matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A good person, after all, despite the strong words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen then was about to continue his attack, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re wrong, Ryuuen-kun. I&rsquo;m enough of a selfish
            person.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying this, Ichinose put her hand on her chest and smiled.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you have a problem you can&rsquo;t solve, just think about it. If you still
            can&rsquo;t come up with the answer, try taking action. That opens up most paths.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, who knows?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose thought back. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night of the school trip. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her destiny began changing that day. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small chance. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, it was a result drawn out by instinct, which does not even consider
            possibilities.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night when everyone was at the inn. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A blizzard. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Herself disappearing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">How would her classmates move and what would happen if a big deal was made out of it?
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t anything surprising that Ayanokoji found her. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that time, at that moment, everything was inevitable. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something unpleasant clung to Ryuuen&rsquo;s hand holding the umbrella, and then to
            his whole body.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m going to the gym now. I
            don&rsquo;t want to waste even a second of my happy time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen sensed that all the analysis he had made of Ichinose up until now had been
            negated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichinose no longer showed even a hint of interest towards Ryuuen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She began walking, passed Ryuuen by and headed for Keyaki Mall.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I take back what I said, Ichinose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryuuen turned around to Ichinose&rsquo;s back and began speaking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We may be lucky after all that we&rsquo;re not going to run into you in the
            final test.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A premonition.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a remark to respect the fact that, even if for a single moment, Ryuuen had
            felt more danger from Ichinose than he did from Sakayanagi.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is Kinugasa. We&rsquo;re completely in the new year 2023 now. I&rsquo;m looking
            forward to another year with you all. Last year was very busy in various ways, including the second season
            of the anime.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The third season is coming up this year, so I think it will be busy this year
            too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a personal matter, but I&rsquo;ve recently developed a routine in my weekday
            activities. I&rsquo;m not getting enough exercise because of my desk job, so I&rsquo;m either walking or
            riding my bicycle. I spend the rest of the day trying to come up with ideas for things to do until lunch
            time, and then I go home. I stay at my workplace until night, work, and sleep. I repeat this process five
            times a week. As for my weekends, I spend half the day working and half the day playing with my children.
            Weekdays pass in a flash, but the weekend days feel three times as long&hellip; But surprisingly, I come up
            with more interesting ideas on such days. As for a recent worry I&rsquo;ve been having, it always takes a
            while for me to get better after catching a cold, but my cough and runny nose haven&rsquo;t gone away since
            before christmas. Both over-the-counter and hospital medicine have been barely effective, and I still
            don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m going to fully recover any time soon&hellip; The cough is especially bad. I
            feel especially bad when I have a coughing fit while shopping at a supermarket or something, even through a
            mask. Please let me get warm and healthy soon!</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the main story from here. With this volume 9, the long
            second term arc is over. I want to thank all of you for being with me up until now. I would be very happy if
            you continue to keep me company. Ayanokoji, and the other characters also are preparing for the third term,
            and year three. I think that the contents of the third term arc will be a little harsher than of the second
            term, so please understand that in advance.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, the next Installment will be about the winter holiday as is the custom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering that my recovery time will decrease for the meantime, the next volume
            loosely (probably) based on the winter holiday will probably be an important one. We will be apart for a
            little while again, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing you again before this summer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c5 c6" id="h.1mrcu09"><span class="c22">Thanks&hellip;</span></h1>

    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c11">Thank you, the reader, for reading this Translation of Year 2 Volume 9. I hope you
            had fun. This Volume certainly had some real shocker moments with some characters. Despite the special exam
            not being the focus of the volume, this exceeded expectations in other regards. So, overall, it was really
            enjoyable. Also as mentioned above in the afterword by the author, Season 3 will be this year too! And who
            knows how close it is? June? July? Or late in winters? There&rsquo;s no info yet but it will soon be
            announced, which I am looking forward to. Speaking of which&hellip; Also looking forward to the next volume
            which will be Year 2 Volume 9.5 (Release Date - June 25, 2023). With the way things are going &nbsp;these
            next couple of volumes might get dark and who knows Y2V9.5 could contain some unexpected events. Ah&hellip;
            Can&rsquo;t wait for it all to happen!</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c11"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c18">So, Look forward to it. I am really excited for Year 2 Volume 9.5 and for more
            updated information on it you can follow me </span><span class="c30"><a class="c10"
