    <p class="c7"><span class="c35"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c26">Intro</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The morning of the day of the school trip. Four buses in total gathered, and all the
            Second Year students in their personal clothes lined up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The temperature was below 5 degrees this morning, and the cold wind was almost
            prickling my skin from time to time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, in Hokkaido, where we&#39;re headed now, the temperature will drop further.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because of that, the school made sure that the students did not forget things such as
            gloves or coats. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The final checks of the luggage including clothing, and necessary items such as cell
            phones are finished. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;First of all, I&#39;m relieved that everyone made it to the school trip in good
            health.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mashima-sensei, the teacher in charge of Second Year Class A spoke out thusly before
            we got onto the buses. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The homeroom class teachers in charge of the Second Year students boarded each of the
            four buses, with Mashima-sensei in number 1 and Chabashira-sensei in number 2.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakagami-sensei with number 3, and Hoshinomiya-sensei with number 4. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Basically, it was in order from A Class to D Class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the meantime, I checked the schedule on my phone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The bus will head for Haneda Airport, and we&#39;ll disembark from a plane in
            Shinchitose Airport. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From then on, we&#39;ll get on the buses on location, and head for the ski place for
            the first day. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I quietly browsed the listing page of the groups. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can see the names of the eight people in my group, with group no. six written
            there. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou Hayato and Yamamura Miki from Class A. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Me and Kushida Kikyou from Class B. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen Kakeru and Nishino Takeko from Class C. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, Watanabe Norihito and Amikura Mako from Class D.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t have any complaints about the groups divided by the school, but to think
            that I would be grouped with Ryuen, a presence of great trouble for many students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know a lot of details about Kito, Yamamura, Watanabe, Nishino, and
            Amikura because I almost have no interactions with them, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll learn more about them
            soon. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The members who will be with me for 4 nights and 5 days during the school trip are
            decided. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a peculiar group that is difficult to judge if the relationships are strong
            or not. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">By the way, the numbers I&#39;ve given to each student is 6 for Kushida, 18 for
            Watanabe, 14 for Amikura, 6 for Ryuen, and 18 for Nishino, 9 for Kitou, and 14 for Yamamura.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I gave them their rankings by only taking the OAA shown by the school as a basis,
            without considering my closeness to them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of these, I gave Kushida and Ryuen the highest rankings. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, this doesn&rsquo;t have to mean that the other 7 have given each other the
            same ratings too.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When it comes to Ryuen in particular, many students hate him and it wouldn&#39;t
            surprise me if extremely low numbers were written for him. Kitou in particular, who stands by Sakayanagi
            might have given Ryuen a good number.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No, that may just be my imagination after all. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since Ryuen has the qualities and the characteristics of a leader, there is no
            contradiction for him to be given a high enough ranking to be fitting of that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I know from the other day&#39;s numbering that it isn&#39;t completely random, but I
            may not be able to find the answers with my delusions from now on.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t even know 5 out of these 7 people...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, is it really okay to consider the one person I know, Ryuen, in that
            category? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I think I&#39;ve been able to extend my circle of friends in my own way for the past
            year and a half, but it&#39;s a different matter when it comes to the other classes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well then, it seems that the time for the bus ride is approaching. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The students started gathering with the other students they&#39;re close with.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the bus we are about to ride, there is no fixture for who will sit where. If it
            was me from a long time ago, then I personally would have been glad if the seatings were decided. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now that I have Kei as my girlfriend, it is easy to know who will inevitably sit next
            to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if this was her cue, Kei waved her hand and stood next to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, at around the same time as Kei, Yousuke showed up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kiyotaka-kun, got a moment?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hm?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s about the bus seats, but can I sit next to you if it&#39;s
            okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Next to me? But Why?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next to Yousuke, a special seat. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Me taking that away would provoke antipathy. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I wouldn&#39;t think Mii-chan has the courage to invite Yousuke openly after it
            became known that she likes him because of Kushida&#39;s revelation, but she&#39;s not the only one waiting
            for an opportunity. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Backing this up, I can see the enthusiastic gazes of several girls. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke looked into my eyes and pleaded. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After worrying about the sparks coming from the struggle for the seat, I suppose this
            is his best course of action. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a lot of work to be popular, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t wanna be popular, you know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without pride, he simply answered so calmly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">His ability to infer the unwritten rules of the class is outstanding. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He worries about his own affairs as much as he does other people&#39;s, and most
            people think he tries to avoid conflict.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So, is it okay if I have Yousuke sit next to me, Kei?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I wanna say &quot;Ehh~?&quot;, but I guess it can&#39;t be helped.
            Okay.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kei seems broad-minded towards Yousuke who she is indebted to, so she agreed. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In exchange, Kiyotaka has to sit on the aisle seat, okay? Because I&#39;ll sit
            on the other side of the aisle, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I suppose that&#39;s a simple response. As a result, with the four seats in one
            row a little behind the center of the bus, it was Yousuke, me, then Kei and Satou sat on the other side of
            the aisle from left to right. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A few minutes later, we finished boarding the buses and left for the airport. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We are not allowed to leave our seats while the bus is moving, but we are free to
            chat, and we are allowed to consume the food and the drinks we brought in. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As a result, some students immediately started taking out snacks. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Now it feels like a trip, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke happily muttered so after looking around him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For this man, whose happiness is the happiness of others, I am sure he is comfortable
            with the feelings he is sensing from the other students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, ah~. It would have been great if I was grouped with Kiyotaka.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The boy that Kei was together with in class was Akito, someone with whom I can say
            she has no contact with at all.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s a good opportunity, isn&#39;t it? We don&#39;t have
            many opportunities to interact with the other classes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not really asking for something like that, but... Tsch.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps thinking she is going to be lonely here, she pouted her lips with some
            dissatisfaction. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But I&#39;m sure she still remembers what I said the other day.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kei&#39;s eyes are also very important for learning the situation in the other
            classes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">By the way, Yousuke is in the same group as Matsushita, and Satou is together with
            Okiya.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, hey, Ayanokoji-kun, how is it going with Kei-chan recently? Is it going
            well?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course it is, right~? There&#39;s no need to even ask that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe he just feels bad for you, or...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t be silly. We&#39;re super lovey-dovey, so. Right~&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Until we reached the airport, this innocent exchange continued.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.44sinio"><span>Part 1</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we landed at Shinchitose Airport, we began lining up in the airport&#39;s lobby.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The buses to Haneda were boarded as a class, but from now on the group conduct
            finally begins. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mashima-sensei is in charge of group number 1 to 5, Chabashira-sensei is in charge of
            groups 6 to 10, Sakagami-sensei is in charge of groups 10 to 15, and Hoshinomiya-sensei is in charge of
            numbers 16 to 20. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Once the group is all gathered, you can decide on the seating. Please discuss
            and decide which seats will be whose.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My group, group 6, has 8 fixed seats granted to us. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The 8 of us will decide where to sit in these 8 seats. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">By the way, the seats are in two rows of two seats on each side from the beginning of
            the car. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I am in group 6, I walked over to the area led by Chabashira-sensei. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like we&#39;re in a group together, Ayanokoji-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The one to call out to me like that was Kushida from the same class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Looks like it. So are you really fine with whoever you get grouped
            with?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Basically, yes. Well... I&#39;m not so welcoming of Ryuen-kun,
            however.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know to what extent they showed their true nature, but Ryuen and Kushida
            should have joined hands for a time. With that reason, he may be a difficult partner to deal with.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not a scary opponent for you any more. You&#39;ve never
            been the type to be afraid of anyone, anyway. Even if he were to make a careless remark about you, it would
            have no influence on your classmates, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I know. It&#39;s Ryuen-kun, who&#39;s aiming for Class A. He could threaten me
            at some point.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was worried if I can handle it, but I think it might be easier now.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if his true nature is exposed, it won&#39;t affect many people. It seems that
            Kushida also has created such a resolve.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kikyou-chan~!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As they emerged from the crowd of students, a boy and a girl from the Ichinose Class
            raised their hands. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s Watanabe Norihito and Amikura Mako. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida, of course, seems to be good friends with Amikura too and they joyfully took
            each others&#39; hands. On the surface, they&#39;re acting like best friends, but when I think that Kushida
            is probably unmoved on the inside, this scene makes quite the spectacle</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s have some fun for the next 5 days.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After Watanabe called out to me, I lightly raised my hand and replied so. We
            haven&#39;t interacted with each other before, so this should be a good opportunity to get to know his
            personality.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Half of us are here now. The next one to show herself was Nishino, followed a little
            later by Ryuen.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Good morning, Nishino-san. And you too, Ryuen-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Taking the lead, Kushida spoke up with a smile. Watanabe and Amikura followed up too.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Hi there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The girl called Nishino seems a bit awkward, not having interacted with Kushida and
            Amikura that much. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, Ryuen did not reply to anyone in particular, and stopped a
            distance away. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Now it&#39;s just Kitou-kun and Yamamura-san left, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If it&#39;s those two, they&#39;ve already come.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I pointed behind Kushida, they noticed that the two had quietly lined up
            together. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as he showed himself, Kitou glared at Ryuen with a silent pressure mixed in.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura, on the other hand, approached with her gaze downcast, looking at no one in
            particular.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like we&#39;re all gathered, so let&#39;s quickly decide on our
            seats.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At a time like this, having a presence in the group that can take the lead like this
            is a big factor. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If there is a problem, I am a little concerned about what Ryuen, who serves as the
            leader of Class C, would say, but... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Surprisingly, however, he did not particularly seem to be interrupting. Either he has
            no intention of commanding other classes, or perhaps he thinks that there is no need to go out on matters as
            small as where we will sit.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Isn&#39;t it the best for the boys to be with the boys and the girls to be with
            the girls?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Taking advantage of the fact that Kushida took the lead, Amikura proposed so. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you think, everyone? No disagreements?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No one spoke out in objecting about the boys and the girls sitting separately.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Neither Nishino nor Yamamura seemed to care about it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On one side, the boys would not be able to complain in the slightest about
            Amikura&#39;s statement. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If they clumsily disagreed, a composition where the boys want to sit with the girls
            would be formed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then we can have the girls discuss with the girls, and the boys with the boys,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, Kushida began skillfully separating the boy&#39;s side. It would
            have been easier to let Kushida make the decision on how to divide us, but... I suppose it cannot be helped.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe and I naturally gathered together, but Ryuen and Kitou did not move a step.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What should we do, Ayanokoji? This feels like there&#39;s going to be a big
            problem.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m fine with anyone, you know, but I can&#39;t see myself talking with
            Ryuen and Kitou.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can you see me talking with them?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..? Umm... Well&hellip; It&rsquo;s better than putting those two together,
            right?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I could not be happy about the compared subject matter being what it is. Personally,
            I feel like I can get through this without being wrapped up in trouble if I sit with Watanabe, but... As I
            was starting to think that I should just go ahead and make a decision, Kitou approached me without making a
            sound. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;As long as I&#39;m not next to Ryuen, I have no complaints.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He blurted out the most troubling statement, then returned to his original position.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...What should we do?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you force those two to be side by side, it&#39;s going to be a
            disaster...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Having easily imagined this situation too, Watanabe nodded his head in dismay.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then... We have no choice but to separate ourselves. Where do you want to
            be?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m fine with any seat. Sit wherever you&#39;d like, Watanabe.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wherever I&#39;d like, huh..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Faced with two choices that made him want to hold his head, Watanabe pondered for a
            moment before giving an answer. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll just go with Kitou, then. I mean, that guy seems calm in general, so.
            If I don&#39;t turn hostile intent towards him, I don&#39;t think that he&#39;ll do anything to
            me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, Kitou is not as ominous as he looks. I have a clear image of him being
            harmless to all except those hostile to him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 10 : &#20154;&#30044;&#28961;&#23475; Jinchiku Mugai, lit. harmless to
            humans and animals.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well then, I should make sure I greet them too. The school trip is long, with 4
            nights and 5 days.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You may be unwilling, but as long as there aren&#39;t any problems, I&#39;ll be
            next to you during the school trip. I want to be considerate and give you the window seat, so are you
            alright with that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whatever.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For now, he seems as quiet and meek as a borrowed cat.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 11 : &#20511;&#12426;&#12390;&#12365;&#12383;&#29483; Karitekita Neko, lit.
            &quot;borrowed cat&quot;. Expression used to mean someone who is acting quiet and meekly like a cat not in
            its own house.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If he thought it through, it would be no strange thing for him to be absent from the
            school trip without permission, but he&#39;s earnestly participating, which is impressive of Ryuen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You ain&#39;t misunderstanding things, eh, Ayanokoji?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Misunderstanding?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The preliminary battle between me and Sakayanagi has already begun, you
            know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, Ryuen gave a glare to Kitou. Kitou, on the other hand, is also
            glaring back as if he was expecting such a gaze to come towards him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. This school trip will inevitably lead to exchanges with the other
            classes. So you&#39;re saying that this is a great opportunity to look for gaps in each other?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a good opportunity to see what kind of guy Kitou is. Depending on the
            situation, I&#39;ll crush him right away.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a disturbing statement that makes it hard to believe the trip to Hokkaidou
            will be joyful and enjoyable.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I suppose this won&#39;t end as just a simple trip. That being said, was
            Sakayanagi&#39;s group number 4? I recalled in my mind the members who were allocated to number 4.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s Tokitou Hiroya and Morofuji Rika from the Ryuen Class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The second term is not over yet, but, heading towards the end of the school year,
            there&#39;s nothing wrong with starting to look into each other already. If we end up clashing with the two
            classes that have prepared for battle, it will be quite the challenge.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the school decided that the group&#39;s discussion was over, they began to lead
            the way. I gave Ryuen the window seat in the bus, and I sat next to him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was a lively atmosphere inside the buses travelling on a class-by-class basis,
            but it was now silent like a lie.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A group designated by the school mixing with different classes. Not all students are
            close friends, so I suppose it will take some time for them to open up and be able to talk casually. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if proving this, half the students riding on the bus were separated by class and
            not by gender. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is an inevitable example of what happens when you can&#39;t take the initiative
            like Kushida and decide who you&#39;ll sit next to.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Still, all of the students wanted to enjoy the trip. About 30 minutes after the
            bus&#39; departure, most of the introductions were over, and the group&#39;s conversation started widening
            outside just one&#39;s own classmates. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, when it was explained that we can use karaoke, one of the boys started singing
            with a microphone in his hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I felt the same thing from that first year as I do from you. Do you know
            him?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I did not think Ryuen would ever speak to me during the trip, but such words flew
            from the side with no warning. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the posture of his elbows, he&#39;s speaking as if talking to himself without
            even looking at me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What if I say I have nothing to do with him?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That can&#39;t be true. He was beating the damn teachers away just to get to
            you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s true that with that, it doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;re unrelated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I just know him a bit. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So I shouldn&#39;t care about him? I can smell something fishy from over
            here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s no point in turning your eyes towards a first year. Isn&#39;t the
            important thing getting up to Class A?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll do whatever I want. This may be useful for beating you to death one
            day.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see. So rather than having an interest in Yagami, he&#39;s keeping an eye on him
            because he thinks that this may be a weak point for me, who is standing behind him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, it will not become a weakness, but I won&#39;t deny that it&#39;s a troubling
            factor.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s enough to make some crazy guys drag a first year along. Further, the
            damn school even took a stance of tolerating it. I feel like for a moment, I saw the true identity of a
            suspicious bastard like you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s a shame, though. Yagami isn&#39;t here anymore.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s true that he&#39;s out, but isn&#39;t there still a girl from first
            year called Amasawa left? I can just play with her.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that Yagami somehow left behind a little information.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I remain silent, there is a high enough chance that Ryuen will start to mess with
            Amasawa. In a one on one fight, I&#39;m sure Amasawa would not fall behind. But, in the case of Ryuen, it
            won&#39;t end with that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s easy to imagine him to persistently keep clinging for an opening, and
            repeatedly trying to make contact. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, in normal times, Amasawa would have the ability to react to this to some
            extent, but now that Yagami has been expelled, the situation is unstable. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whatever. Anyway, there&#39;s still some time before I&#39;ll fight with
            you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, seeing my thoughts and replying as such. There&#39;s a lot I want to say, but
            it is true that he would focus on the Sakayanagi class which is certain to get to the end of the school
            term, &nbsp;rather than the Horikita class with which there is no knowing when a battle will materialize.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;By the way, Ryuen, there&#39;s one thing I want to ask. I&#39;ve been thinking
            about it since this morning, actually.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I put my hand out and reached into the netted pocket in the back of the seat in front
            of me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, I took the black plastic bag set there.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve been wondering what this bag is for.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He suspiciously came close to me, and laughed with his nose.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a bag to use when you puke, right? Are you fucking with
            me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. Indeed, I suppose there is a possibility of puking if you get nauseous
            in cars.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So this is what is commonly known as an etiquette bag.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It wasn&#39;t set up in the bus to the Uninhabited Island Special Test. I guess
            it isn&#39;t used commonly.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We&#39;ve gotten on buses many times until now, but it&#39;s the first time something
            like this was in the pocket. I suppose this is for us as much as it is out of consideration for the bus
            company. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure it would be very hard to clean up if someone clumsily spread their vomit
            all over the seats or the floor. I&#39;ve come here after looking into a variety of things, but there are
            still numerous things I don&#39;t know about. I suppose it is expected that I will encounter the unknown if
            I leave the school. </span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re a weirdo as always. Are you telling me you&#39;re some rich kid

    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It is true that I don&#39;t have that much experience.&quot;</span></p>

    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span>Part 2</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After having lunch in the large cafeteria attached to the ski place, the Second year
            students finally got their ski lessons. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The risk of losing something or having an accident is still high, so &nbsp;a
            directive was put out that prohibits taking mobile phones onto the slopes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There were some complaints from the experienced students who were dependent on their
            phones and insisted that they were used to handling them, but there is no breaking the school&#39;s rules,
            so it can&#39;t be helped. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Fortunately, from the following day onwards, we were informed that we would be
            allowed to take our mobile phones if we wanted to go to the ski place ourselves. However, in the case of a
            lost item or an accident, &nbsp;there will be a fitting amount of private points required. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, we put on our rented skiwear and received our ski boots. The outer face seems
            to be made of plastic. I followed the instructions to unbuckle, spread the innerwear and put my feet
            through. I fit my heels through them, straightened up the innerwear and &nbsp;tied the buckle from down
            below to the top. Finally, I tied my power belt and powder guarded it. With this, it seems that my required
            preparations are complete. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I tried to walk as normal, but I can&#39;t seem to make the correct movements. When I
            followed the instructor and walked by landing on my heels, I was able to move smoothly.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My preparations are finished, so I headed outside. The lessons are divided into three
            categories of advanced, intermediate and beginner. As I do not have any experience with skiing, I didn&#39;t
            hesitate to join the mass of people who wanted beginners&#39; training.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I could have investigated in books or the internet beforehand, but this is a good
            opportunity to learn on the spot, so I didn&#39;t take in any unnecessary information. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">About 60% of the entire school year wanted this beginners&#39; training. It isn&#39;t
            clear whether this is a lot or few, but it was a little surprising that 40% of the students were
            intermediate and above. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t think you would get many chances to ski in the Kanto region, but these
            people somehow experienced it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, Kitou, Nishino and Kushida from Group 6 were absent, probably because they
            were intermediate or above, with the remaining members being beginners. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The crowded beginners&#39; course is further divided into groups of about 10, and the
            instructors are teaching us how to ski from scratch. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I held great interest in the ski equipment I&#39;m touching for the first time, I
            listened to the explanation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, the advanced skiers who were the fewest in number seemed to be
            free to ski immediately after receiving only a simple explanation, and were quickly getting ready to get
            onto the slopes and ski. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen&#39;s figure was also among them. I cleared the snow from the back of my boots,
            then aligned the binding with the front and the back, and stepped in with my heel. I see. I&#39;m walking
            around with both my feet enveloped. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While thinking that it was unexpected to not fall down as I tried to walk, I was
            perplexed by this new sensation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Right... At any rate, while using the pole, I tried to slide somewhat forcefully,
            intentionally tilting my center of weight to the left. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I did so and moved the board forward, my body collapsed the other way in
            response. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Are you okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura, who was watching from closeby called out to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. I just wanted to take a little tumble.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A bit of laughter occured around me, but it&#39;s nothing to worry about. It&#39;s
            important to try and fail at first.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, who I thought was already headed for the lift, raised the corners of his mouth
            slightly when he saw me fall down and walked away in satisfaction. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps he wanted to see me fail.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Be careful over there!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After being warned, I lightly bowed and apologized, and followed the instructor&#39;s
            directions. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that we had to do some actual light skiing, but an unexpectedly large number of
            people fell. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There were a couple of unintentional falls, but, alright, I&#39;m getting the hang of
            it now. The course took about 30 minutes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With all the steps completed, I have a lot of free time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright, let&#39;s do this.&quot;</span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.z337ya"><span>Part </span><span class="c15">3</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After the training was over, it seems that Watanabe and the others gathered together
            and were heading for the beginners&#39; course, which has a gentle slope. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ayanokoji? You&#39;re not going?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who had started walking away with his board turned around, &nbsp;spoke so
            with wonder. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think I want to ski in a different place a bit.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. See you later, then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While seeing them off from their backs, I decided to start moving myself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, Ayanokoji. You should piss off to the beginners&#39; course over there,
            this is for advanced skiers.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, who was headed for that advanced course, pointed at me in a depressing manner.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, it&#39;s fine. I just want to challenge it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? Can a guy who was walking like a penguin just now really say that
            line?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think you should stop there, Ayanokoji-kun. It&#39;s about 70% hard humps and
            steep slopes, so even I was scared.&quot;, said Kushida. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that the two already skied once, so they warned me so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was a warning, so I wanted to follow it, but...</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the corner of my eye, Yamamura restlessly got onto the advanced lift and went up.
            I don&#39;t think that she chose the advanced course on purpose. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps she saw Kitou&#39;s back on the lift ahead of her, and got onto it by mistake
            without being stopped by the others around her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Looks like it wasn&#39;t just for show when Yamamura said in the bus that
            she has a faint presence.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s Yamamura. I don&#39;t think she got onto it knowing that it&#39;s the
            advanced course.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I told them about Yamamura who was sitting on the lift going up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whoa... We should probably go after her.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With that, I took a ski lift for the first time in my life and headed for the
            advanced course together. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Two can enter the lift at the same time, so I got onto it with Kushida. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The lift started to climb up without stopping, and my feet separated from the ground.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Interesting ride, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re riding one for the first time, right? Aren&#39;t you
            scared?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not scared. Because a fall still won&#39;t do much damage at this
            height.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait, that&#39;s the problem..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hm? Isn&#39;t this something to fear because of the danger of the shock of the
            fall?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s, yep, I think it&#39;s like that, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She seems a bit confused about some of my words, but I don&#39;t understand the
            reason. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, whatever. I&#39;ve been thinking lately that it&#39;s a waste of time to
            think about you, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She huffed, and I could see the true Kushida for a moment. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is a relatively long distance between lifts and the wind is still blowing
            somewhat strongly, so she must have judged that there is no need to worry about our chatter being heard by
            Ryuen ahead of us and those behind us.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not so happy about that expression.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&#39;s no human that would be glad about being told that it&#39;s pointless to
            think about them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It can&#39;t be helped, right? I really feel that way, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, Kushida sent her gaze towards the mountains in the distance. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m confident that I can read the atmosphere around me and the thoughts of
            other people. This is the same even for Horikita-san or Ryuen-kun. Of course, I can still lose if this is
            outweighed by other factors, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because victory isn&#39;t certain just because you can guess the thoughts of other
            people. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I used to think that I could read you too, Ayanokoji-kun. But I was completely
            wrong. For the first time, I can&#39;t even guess what a person is thinking.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;For reference, how does that feel?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? You wanna ask that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without looking back, she asked back with the back of her head towards me. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess I shouldn&#39;t ask, after all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The atmosphere strongly suggests that she is reluctant.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida&rsquo;s expression as she quickly turned back was not fierce... It was the
            same as usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very important subject so I&rsquo;d like to confirm it here and
            now... You&rsquo;re not planning to expel me, are you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm... You asked that quite clearly.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As long as I can&rsquo;t read your thoughts, Ayanokoji-kun, I have to think on
            my own. If I was Ayanokoji-kun, what would I think? How would I move?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean the conclusion of that is that I&rsquo;m trying to expel
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida nodded without hesitation, and then stared into my eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I think she&rsquo;s trying to unsettle me and find out my true intentions.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll avert my gaze on purpose and try to create an atmosphere where it looks
            like I am aiming to expel her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From a normal person&rsquo;s point of view, it would look like she was right on the
            mark, and I looked away with discomfort.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was curious how Kushida would think about this.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you messing with me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am sorry...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As my hidden secret was obvious from my face, I understood that I was being glared at
            even though she was smiling, and instantly apologized.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on, you&rsquo;re definitely making fun of me, right? Is this funny for
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t funny at all. Sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure she is reluctant, but with what happened just now Kushida was able to
            completely read my mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have no intention of expelling you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When Horikita decided to let you stay, I lost my means of expelling you. If I
            wanted to leave that possibility open even now, I would have taken the choice to talk Horikita out of it. I
            don&rsquo;t think Kushida&rsquo;s suspicions will be cleared, but this is an undeniable truth.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Unanimous Special Exam, you know...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I know that for her, the time of the Unanimous Special Exam must be an unforgettable
            humiliation.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The main premise now is that Kushida won&rsquo;t repeat the same mistake again, but
            there is no point in going to the trouble of mentioning that here.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the first place, now that all of her classmates know about it, it is no longer
            realistic.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if I can&rsquo;t eliminate everyone, there is a possibility that I can
            abandon this class. A class transfer ticket, or I could save my private points. I can leave with such
            methods. Can you ignore such a risk factor?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The fact that she calls herself a risk factor on her own, is the interesting part
            about Kushida.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would not be treachery or any such thing, it would simply be a personal
            strategy. As the school actually has this system in place, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong about transferring to
            a class that can win. Rather, if I don&rsquo;t think my own class has a chance to win, I will find an
            opportunity and move forward with the transfer when I can.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s saying that no one has a right to tell her to continue staying on a
            sinking ship.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read you after all, Ayanokoji-kun. I can&rsquo;t tell in the
            least if you&rsquo;re talking truthfully or not.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It might be because I don&rsquo;t show it on my face.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just that, but...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Looking Dismayed, Kushida turned her sight to our destination.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wonder why. My secret that I absolutely wanted to keep hidden was exposed,
            so I should have been so frustrated and bitter that nothing would matter any more, but&hellip; I&rsquo;m
            coming to the school trip and having fun skiing. Further, I even feel that there is nothing wrong about
            that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The school trip is a fun event for many students, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For many students, yes. But for me, every event has been a struggle,
            so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The effort to keep pretending something you&rsquo;re not.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I suppose that is precisely what these events require.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm... Can I ask a little something about Yagami-kun and
            Amasawa-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those two from first year, huh? I had a bit of an entanglement with Amasawa,
            but I don&rsquo;t know much about Yagami.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For now, I tried to emphasize this, but Kushida may have simply spoken out the doubts
            hidden inside her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, Ayanokoji-kun, then it can&rsquo;t be
            helped.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. So? What about those two?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know Yagami-kun was expelled, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I heard that the fact he used violence in the Uninhabited Island Exam came to
            light. Further, there are even rumours he hit teachers, so I think it&rsquo;s only natural he was expelled,
            but... He&rsquo;s your Kouhai, right? You two looked close, so it was a shock, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 14 : &#24460;&#36649; Kouhai, someone from a lower year/rank. Opposite of
            Senpai]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yagami was a White Room student. In other words, he had no connection with Kushida in
            the past.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The information given by Tsukishiro&rsquo;s side was used as a guise, and Kushida was
            probably made to think of him as her Kouhai, considering the risk of him learning about the past.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, there is no way for me, an outsider, to deduce this, so I have no choice but
            to give this answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wrong. Yagami-ku-.. He knew of my past. Only the Horikita siblings went to the
            same middle school as me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re asking how he knew of your past?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He told me directly. So I, naturally, was suspicious of Horikita-san and you,
            Ayanokoji-kun. Ryuen-kun also knew of my true nature, but he doesn&rsquo;t know my past, so I can leave him
            out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is true that her true nature and her past are completely different things.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t add up with Horikita-san, right? There is no merit for
            her to speak of my past. In which case, by a process of elimination, you&rsquo;re the only one left,
            Ayanokoji-kun. That has been bugging me for all this time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, I am one of the few students who know of Kushida&rsquo;s past.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was inevitable that she would act hostile towards me in the Unanimous Special
            Exam, but her suspicions towards me may have also been among the reasons for her hostility.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, with it being clear that Amasawa was also involved with Kushida, I end up
            being a suspicious person with my own connection to Amasawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I simply deny it here, then the question of who revealed her past would cling to
            Kushida&rsquo;s mind. It&rsquo;s a different matter to clear away her suspicions.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care either way. I just want to know the truth.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if I am connected to Yagami and Amasawa, you&rsquo;ll forgive
            me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Of course I won&rsquo;t. But... All I&rsquo;m saying is that I
            won&rsquo;t try to do something to you because of it. Rather, I think I will recognize again that you are a
            foe far beyond my level.&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Right now, her fangs are meekly pulled back. She&rsquo;s saying that she will only
            pull them back even further.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, no... There&rsquo;s no one other than you coming up in my mind,
            Ayanokoji-kun, but I think it might not be you. That guy wanted to expel you. He wasn&rsquo;t pretending, it
            was from the bottom of his heart. There&rsquo;s a contradiction, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The reason for me being connected to the Yagami side and leaking information becomes
            doubtful.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is only a hassle to go out of my way to hunt down Kushida like that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With such suspicions in her mind, it must have been quite difficult to continue her
            school life.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Still, I can&rsquo;t talk concretely about White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I met Yagami in my old school, so I knew who he was. We lived close by,
            so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also the same for Amasawa. I think I&#39;ve caused those two to
            have a misunderstanding, so they always resented me. I was able to solve the misunderstanding with Amasawa,
            but, I couldn&rsquo;t do so with Yagami. I responded by ignoring him, but I suppose he came in contact with
            you before I knew it. &ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, in that case, isn&rsquo;t it strange? He shouldn&rsquo;t have known
            about me, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he found out, but maybe he looked into you because
            you&rsquo;re my classmate? He must have been looking for a chance to take revenge on me. In other words, you
            were simply dragged into this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I lightly bowed, and apologised to Kushida.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even though I didn&rsquo;t know about it, I&rsquo;m sorry that you got
            involved because of me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Ayanokoji-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I won&rsquo;t say she is completely relieved, but I&#39;m sure she will come up with
            a lot of answers now that she knows I was connected with those two in the past.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could Yagami-kun&rsquo;s expulsion... Could it be your doing,
            Ayanokoji-kun?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I ignored him, there is a high possibility that it would bring you, who
            chose to help the class out, into harm&rsquo;s way. The fact that Amasawa came into contact with you must
            have also been because she knew Yagami would do something to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For this point, I&rsquo;ll answer honestly.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nagumo, Ryuen, and Horikita. Several people either know or suspect my
            involvement.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the truth comes out after I deny it, it will be too much trouble.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Amasawa remained in the school, but, like I said earlier, I solved her
            misunderstanding. She shouldn&rsquo;t hinder you in the future. She may still have some issues with the
            things you say and do, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The creation of an environment where Kushida can utilize her true abilities to their
            full extent in her school life. It may be created from this unexpected discussion.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As a strong wind blew, Kushida&rsquo;s white knit hat, which she was wearing
            shallowly, was about to be blown off.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to stop that, I reached out with my hand and pushed the hat with my
            palm.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the same time, Kushida&rsquo;s hand also came on top of mine.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oops, thanks.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was highly likely that it wouldn&rsquo;t have blown away even without me lending a
            hand, but Kushida turned towards me while thanking me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;She immediately went rigid, staring into my eyes, and wasn&rsquo;t moving
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t understand what she was thinking, but she quickly turned her gaze
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the lift reached its destination and we got ready to disembark.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you go?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think I can handle it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I replied so, but Kushida got off first, as if to set an example, and I followed
            after her. After the long lift ride, we arrived at the advanced course.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There seemed to be fewer people here than down below, but it should be enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is pretty amazing, huh.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The slopes are steeper than you thought, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just as Kushida said, the slope looks steeper than what I had seen looking up from
            below.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you really sure?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll manage somehow.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If something goes wrong, it might be better to walk down to the side of the
            slope after taking your boards off. I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t be cool, but...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I got it. But, Yamamura is more important right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The ski place is crowded with a mix of students and regular tourists, so it will be
            hard to find her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought she would notice that she can&rsquo;t ski here and be waiting by the
            lift, but...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida and I looked around our surroundings together.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yet, we can&rsquo;t find Yamamura&rsquo;s figure right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe she has already started skiing..? That can&rsquo;t be,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There are many sliding down the slopes, but no one appears to be a clear beginner. On
            the other hand, there were many boys and girls gathered around Ryuen.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those students are in Ryuen-kun&rsquo;s class, right? I guess he&rsquo;s more
            popular than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;re having a lot of fun talking to each
            other, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The gathered students are saying something to Ryuen with a very serious expression on
            their faces.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, who is in the middle, seems to be simply listening without looking at anyone
            in particular.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Why are they gathering in an uncrowded place like the advanced course on
            purpose?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If they wanted to keep in touch with the class, they could just use their cellphones
            later.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In which case... I can only assume that they intentionally formed such a
            gathering.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe he was reporting something?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The members who had gathered were Kaneda, Ishizaki, Kondou and others who often
            received instructions from Ryuen.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There she is, Ayanokoji-kun. Yamamura-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Kushida said so, Yamamura really was in the direction she was looking at.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without skiing, she was looking at Ryuen&rsquo;s class which was dispersing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamamura-sa-..&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida was about to call out in a loud voice, but I signalled for her to be quiet
            with my finger and eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please wait a bit.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura&rsquo;s movements are a bit puzzling. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She went up to the advanced course while knowing it was a mistake, and stayed there
            silently, as if trying to hide her presence.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What kind of student is Yamamura?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What kind of student? I guess I don&rsquo;t really know much about her
            either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have the widest range of acquaintances in the school, but there are
            students even you don&rsquo;t know, huh...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I could get a grasp if she was someone that talked to me
            on her own, but Yamamura-san is different. She hasn&rsquo;t talked to me even once, and if I talk to her
            myself, she gives a short reply of nodding silently and ends it. I can&rsquo;t get to know her like that,
            can I?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she is closing herself off, then it is true that even Kushida can&rsquo;t do
            anything about it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who are the students in Class A that she gets along with?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that either... I can&rsquo;t even imagine her talking with
            anyone. She has a very faint presence, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The group was just formed, but I still have a faint impression of her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura&rsquo;s personal OAA revealed that she has low physical ability but high
            academic ability.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Soon enough, the students who had gathered around Ryuen scattered and returned to
            their own groups.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the same time, Yamamura cut her gaze off from Ryuen&rsquo;s side and began to
            slowly move.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The two of us followed her with our eyes so as to not lose her, and&hellip;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, she fell.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps caught in the snow, Yamamura fell on the spot.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There were some people around, but no one noticed or even looked like they wanted to
            help her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to have a faint presence, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So why are you looking at me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the representative of a faint presence, aren&rsquo;t you? Well,
            you used to be, I should say.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a sad thing that I can&rsquo;t deny it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter how hard I try, I can&rsquo;t do anything about that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, how does Yamamura&rsquo;s movements look like to you,
            Kushida?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Running away from the subject, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not running away.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I denied it, but Kushida still laughed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamamura-san&rsquo;s movements... Maybe she&rsquo;s watching over
            Ryuen-kun&rsquo;s movements under someone&rsquo;s instruction?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very likely. I think there&rsquo;s only one person who could do
            that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sakayanagi-san, right? But I don&rsquo;t see a connection between her and
            Yamamura-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would precisely be the reason, wouldn&rsquo;t it? No one is aware of that
            connection. Even I might not have noticed if I wasn&rsquo;t put in the same group as Yamamura. We are both
            beginners, so I was curious what she would do. If I had been an intermediate or higher, I would have already
            started skiing without worrying about it.&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you can confirm whether there is a connection or not, then it&rsquo;s best
            you do so, if you can.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It may be important for fighting with Sakayanagi in the future. I can&rsquo;t
            avoid the task of figuring out who is an important person at hand for Sakayanagi.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yamamura&rsquo;s moving.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We kept watching over Yamamura&rsquo;s movements.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Taking off her boards, she was walking down the steep slope from the edge with
            fear.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go support her a bit. Maybe I can get closer to her.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida, deciding what she had to do, started sliding.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s moving fast, huh.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She is quick-witted, and she can smoothly read my intent.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, Kushida has strong conversational skills that lets her get close with most
            people.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As long as that is the way for her to stay in her own class, then she has to keep it
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well then, maybe I should try experiencing this advanced course by myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.3j2qqm3"><span>Part 4</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After our time at the ski place, we arrived at the ryokan before 5 pm.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to head towards the room given to us, we went to the lobby in turns starting
            from group 1.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was group 6&rsquo;s turn right away, so we followed on.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Though the exterior felt historic, the interior of the lobby and such were well
            maintained and clean.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I changed into my inside slippers, put my luggage down, and waited to receive my
            keys.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew it already, but we&rsquo;re supposed to sleep with these people,
            huh...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe sighed with a little melancholy after receiving his key in the lobby.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We&#39;ll be sharing a room with the same group of people we&rsquo;ll be with from
            now on, so there&rsquo;s no changing this.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That means it&rsquo;s up to us whether we can make it a comfortable space or
            not.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Watanabe.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe turned around when he heard his name called, and saw a Boston bag coming at
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoah!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who caught it with both arms, couldn&#39;t comprehend the situation and was
            surprised.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Carry it to the room. I&rsquo;m going to the bathroom.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was Ryuen who threw the bag, who apparently intended on making Watanabe carry
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Watanabe did not have the bravery to say no and smiled bitterly, Ryuen disappeared
            towards the back of the building, probably where the large bathhouse is.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uuh... I don&rsquo;t think I can do this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m the one he asked, after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Rather than asked, I would say he was the easiest one to push this onto.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it. I&rsquo;ll send it back to him, no, I&rsquo;ll send it back to
            hell.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou, after seeing Ryuen&rsquo;s arrogant behaviour, tried to snatch the Boston bag
            from Watanabe&rsquo;s arms.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I put my arms in front of Kitou, and stopped him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You better not do anything untactful. Watanabe would be the one getting in the
            most trouble after.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So do you intend on letting that man do whatever he wants? If he takes this,
            then Ryuen will do the same thing again next time. He can use his own classmates as slaves, but Watanabe is
            a student of the Ichinose class.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou is right.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, there is no need to do anything with this luggage because of that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You should separate from this Boston bag, and tell him directly.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And what if he doesn&rsquo;t listen? Do you want Watanabe to suffer during the
            trip?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no, it&rsquo;s not like I&#39;m suffering or anything...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Ryuen does something selfish to Watanabe again, I&rsquo;ll be the one
            stopping him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah, you?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If he still doesn&rsquo;t listen, I will take all of the
            responsibility.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a fundamental solution.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not entirely true. If the person left with the work is displeased
            about it, then it is force and coercion. On the other hand, if I don&rsquo;t feel any frustration and I
            think that I want to do it for the sake of the group, then it&rsquo;s fine. With that, the problem
            disappears, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou thinks that everything should be done by oneself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He may not agree with what I&rsquo;m saying, but he should understand it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After staring at me for a while, Kitou finally broke down and backed off.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ayanokoji, this is all my fault.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t your fault, Watanabe. It is only natural that we should come
            together to solve the problems of this group.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just as I saw the look of relief on Watanabe&rsquo;s face, two room keys were
            supplied to us by the ryokan staff.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At about the same time, Kushida and the other four girls also received their keys and
            came over here.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey. I think we should talk about our conduct tomorrow. This is a special trip
            to Hokkaido, so I&#39;m sure everyone has a lot of places they&rsquo;d like to go to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is important to make plans in advance, but considering the members of our group,
            we have not been able to discuss our free conduct until this point.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, tonight, I was thinking that all the girls should go to the boys&rsquo;
            room, but... What do you think?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s fine, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe lowered his eyes in joy after receiving the words that the girls would be
            coming to hang out.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou, who was listening from the side, kept silent without saying much.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Umm... Ah, Ayanokoji, you&rsquo;re fine with this too, right?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not being able to ignore Watanabe&rsquo;s worried face, Kushida smiled and clasped
            her hands together.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s decided, right? See you later, then. I&#39;ll go talk with
            Amikura-san and the others too. I&rsquo;ll get in touch with you and Watanabe when I know more details about
            the timing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure the girls will be enjoying the ryokan by soaking in the bath, eating
            lunch and such.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should we go to our own room too?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&rsquo;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The boys will be using each of the rooms in an area called the east wing of the
            ryokan.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The girls on the other hand will be in the main building. They&rsquo;re connected
            with the lobby, so coming and going isn&rsquo;t particularly far or difficult, but I&rsquo;m sure the boys
            and girls are properly separated.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, Kushida-chan is way too nice of a girl, huh? She&rsquo;s cute
            too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have already experienced the appeal that Kushida has which attracts the boys to
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is no wonder that he is attracted to her after only knowing her on a surface
            level.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If a student like Watanabe was to learn of Kushida&rsquo;s true nature, then there is
            no knowing what would happen.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew it already, but I shudder to think what would have happened if
            Kushida-chan wasn&rsquo;t here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, Kushida has been very good at taking the lead of the group. Even the meeting
            to decide our free conduct would have taken a back-seat if there was no one to take initiative to lead the
            meeting.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can do nothing but be grateful to Kushida for working to avoid that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, I don&rsquo;t know if all of the problems are solved with this.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After all, the big problems will still be Ryuen and Kitou.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ever since they started moving together in group 6, they&rsquo;ve always been turning
            killer intent towards each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They have been checking and probing at each other, so the critical situation has been
            continuing.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tapping our slippers on the ground, we arrived at room 203.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I inserted the key, and opened the door leading into the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was reasonably spacious, a Japanese styled room with about 12 tatami mats in size,
            with a table and 4 tatami chairs.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, there was a mini-table and two single-person sofas.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have seen the same scene many times on television, this is quite the traditional
            ryokan.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After putting my luggage down in the Japanese-styled room, I checked the fridge right
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 15 - &#21644;&#23460; Wa Shitsu, Japanese Style Room. &nbsp;The word
            &#21644; is used for things that are traditional japanese style as opposed to western style.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Other than the free water, there was a small amount of soft drinks inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, the price per bottle is higher than the market price, so I don&rsquo;t see a
            reason to touch them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There seems to be a vending machine in the lobby, so if I needed something I could
            just buy it there.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After entering the room, Kitou silently sat in the corner and closed his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, he was sitting in a meditative stance.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Leaving Kitou alone, I opened a thick file with a guide written on it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It contained a map of the ryokan, the name and the password for its internet
            connection, a description of the day-trip bathing service, and a list of each of the sightseeing spots in
            the area were also written on it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There might be a chance to use it in the discussion with Kushida and the
            girls.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After taking a quick look, I decided finally to take a look at the toilet facilities
            and such as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I also learned that the rooms did not have baths, so we would have to bathe in the
            large bathhouse. I guess there is no particular problem with this point.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For me, rather than soaking in a small bathtub, I&rsquo;d like to enjoy the large
            bath if I have the chance to.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see...&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Dinner is served at 7 pm, so there is still some spare time.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I should probably go to the large bathhouse. There must be a lot of people going
            there already.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the bath.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, hey, hey! Wait a bit. I&rsquo;ll come along too!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who was sitting on a chair, stood up while almost falling down.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about you, Kitou?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. I&#39;ll leave one key here, then. When I meet Ryuen, I&rsquo;ll let
            him know, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If there is no one present when he comes back to the room, Ryuen will not be able to
            enter the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That would be trouble in itself, so we have to avoid that happening.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe started whispering as we closed the door and left out onto the
            corridor.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is worrying. We&rsquo;re going to sleep together with Kitou and Ryuen
            now, right? Will we still have a life in the morning?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an exaggeration.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s 4 nights, you know, 4 nights. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to
            think that some mistake could happen in that time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In which case, there would certainly be a lot of trouble.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, leaving Ryuen and Kitou aside, I&#39;m not used to sleeping together with
            other people.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the training camp last year, and my life with Kei, I have been increasingly
            sharing my bedtime with others, so maybe I will be able to easily accept it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since I have always slept alone from when I was a child, I am still confused with the
            change in my environment.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How do I say this... You&rsquo;re pretty easy to talk to,
            Ayanokoji.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so..? I don&rsquo;t really know about that myself,
            though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m happy to hear him say that, but I feel like he&rsquo;s only comparing me with
            those two.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I guess I can say that I get why Ichinose ended up falling in love with
            you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no!.. Please forget what I said just now!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He noticed his obvious slip of the tongue and corrected himself, but I already heard
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, nothing will change because I heard it, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From that expression, you already knew?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I didn&rsquo;t reply, Watanabe looked a little relieved.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...I heard about it. Girls talk about that kind of stuff. I think most of the
            boys still like Ichinose without knowing it, but... Aren&rsquo;t you dating Karuizawa from the same
            class?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was no point in denying this truth, so I nodded and replied.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it must be complicated for the boys who like Ichinose... No, I think
            most of them would actually be happy about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about you, Watanabe?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me? I... Well, it&rsquo;s a secret.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From how calm he looks, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like he holds any special feelings
            towards Ichinose.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know who, but it looks like he has feelings for another girl.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This school trip can be said to be a big event, right? I think there will be
            more than one or two people who confess to the people they like.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, Sudou also had decided on confessing to Horikita during the school
            trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is not unusual, but a rather important event for students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Me too ~... if I had a little more courage, I&#39;d think about it, y&#39;know,
            but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He seemed to imagine a variety of things, Shaking his head from side to side in
            frustration.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Anyway, at the moment I don&#39;t know anything about the creature called
            a girl. For the time being, I want to start practicing by raising my likability so that the girls in our
            group can like me. If I can be someone that leaves an impression, I can gain a lot of experience for the
            real thing. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s been less than half a day since I met Watanabe, but I haven&#39;t had any
            bad impressions. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&#39;s no doubt that he&#39;s basically a good guy. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He seems to get lost in the flow somewhat, and although he is the type that can&#39;t
            refuse anything, he can communicate well with both men and women. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both his academic and physical ability in the OAA is slightly higher than the average
            with C+. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Other items were C or higher in the same way. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, he has no shortcomings. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It depends on the opponent, but I would say there is a good enough possibility...
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Love has many intertwined elements, and mere appearance and ability do not determine
            the success or failure of a confession. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since it depends on the relationship that has been established between the two, you
            can&#39;t identify it in a relationship of about half a day. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.1y810tw"><span>Part </span><span class="c34">5</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">08:37 pm. Many of the students who finished their dinner went to the large bathhouse
            of the ryokan. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That was one of the things that all the students, including Horikita Suzune, were
            looking forward to.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita had finished the meal relatively sooner than the surrounding students, but
            she was surprised to notice that three students had already started to take off their clothes in the
            dressing room.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some of them are girls who don&#39;t like being seen naked, and want to finish their
            meals quickly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, for Horikita, there is no such thing as disgust or shame at being
            seen naked by the same sex. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">One of the reasons for this was that originally, she had a very faint presence in
            elementary and junior high school, and she didn&#39;t have any friends, so there was no one around who would
            pay any attention to the way she looked.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, she spread out her face towel in a certain manner and opened the
            sliding doors to the public baths while concealing her body.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A muddy heat rushed through, and a large bathing area came into view, larger than she
            had imagined. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There are two large indoor baths in the room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then there is one outdoor hot tub, but the large rock bath can be seen through the
            window. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After lightly rinsing off the dirt with hot water, Horikita decided to head for the
            rock bath immediately. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then she was able to recognize two unexpected visitors in the rock bath. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">One of them is a classmate, Kushida Kikyou. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, Horikita-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as she noticed the visitor, Kushida replied, waving lightly to welcome her.
            Of course, Horikita understands that this is not from the heart. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This was because Rokkaku Momoe, a class A student, was also present. Kushida
            won&#39;t show her true feelings in front of students from other classes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita answered with a gentle gaze, and went to the end of the bathtub without
            approaching Kushida. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She wanted to get to a place where no one could talk to her or bother her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After ignoring Kushida and Rokkaku, without speaking with anyone, she continued
            enjoying the hot springs for 5, 10 minutes. At some point, Rokkaku disappeared, and only Kushida
            remained.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There wasn&#39;t even a trace of the smile on her face left. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you leave with Rokkaku-san? Not Exciting Enough?&quot; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? I don&rsquo;t need a specific reason, do I? I just love the hot springs.
            Wait, did you think I wanted to talk to you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not thinking anything like that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Really? Didn&#39;t you ask that because you were aware of it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Those are some stabbing words.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Facing Kushida, who suddenly showed an aggressive approach , Horikita sighed with
            some regret. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You really have a wide range of friendships. I&#39;ve never even spoken to
            Rotsukaku-san before.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In an attempt to change the direction of the conversation, Horikita talks about
            Rotsukaku who left the open-air bath. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;She cried for me to come with her. She was embarrassed, or something. It&#39;s
            not surprising, since she has such a poor body. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even though she knew no one could hear, she was speaking quite harshly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot; As for you, Horikita-san&hellip; you look pretty good. Not that I&rsquo;m
            impressed, though. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After observing Horikita as if evaluating her, Kushida came a little closer to
            Horikita. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What? Do you want me to do something?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Nothing. But, isn&#39;t it a bit weird to be so far apart? You and I are
            classmates. It would be weird if I hadn&#39;t approached you and talked with you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If Rokkaku was there, it would not look strange for the two to be seperated. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, if they were far apart in this large open-air bath, new visitors may have
            questions. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;All I know is that your struggle is incalculable.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The best thing to do, would be to leave this place and go to the indoor
            bath.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll have to refuse that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You won&#39;t listen even if I ask you to quit the school... you&#39;re pretty
            stern, huh, Horikita-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita sighs again as she puts out the word of expulsion. Seeing this, Kushida
            smiles. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What an elegant smile.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course. We can be seen from the indoor bath, so I can&#39;t do anything
            clumsy here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Besides her voice, she&#39;s also considering the surrounding eyes. Students who
            don&#39;t know anything can only see from indoors that their classmates are friendly and laughing with each
            other. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In addition to a sense of distance, she always pays attention to the surroundings and
            does not leave gaps. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you can act that well, maybe you should have lived your school life without
            being revealed to Ayanokoji-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When I first enrolled in school, I wasn&#39;t stressed at all. I didn&#39;t
            think you would be there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sure that was unexpected, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The disappointment after she thought that she was completely cut off from the people
            in middle school is immeasurable. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Living on the premises alone to build new relationships. We have to diverge
            somehow, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As a result of that divergence, the tragedy began when she was found out by
            Ayanokoji.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&#39;re free to keep hating me. If you&#39;re going to contribute to the
            class, I don&#39;t have any complaints. Your contributions at the culture festival were impressive,
            Kushida-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, I can do that much without difficulty.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a weapon to protect herself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, Kushida sends a gaze to the sliding door that leads to the open-air bath and
            stops talking. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Immediately afterwards, Ibuki opened it with a face towel on her shoulder. Kushida,
            who was watching out for visitors, loosened her awareness... because Ibuki already has a good understanding
            of Kushida and Horikita&#39;s true natures. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Horikita!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps looking for Horikita, Ibuki raised her voice as she came into view. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;... Now you&#39;re here?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Approaching boldly and naked, she jumped into the open-air bath. Splashes of water
            swell up, and hot water splashes onto Horikita and Kushida. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s a massive violation of manners.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t care. More importantly, it&#39;s time for a match!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A match in a place like this? Are you saying we should play rock-paper-scissors
            or something?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? In such a large bath like this, there&#39;s only one thing to do, right? A
            match to see who swims fastest from one end to the other!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I could say swimming is more a violation of manners than jumping
            in.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Who cares? It&#39;s not like there are any regular customers, and no one&#39;s
            watching.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A match sounds good to me. I&#39;ll be an impartial observer, so why don&#39;t
            you do it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re talking now? In the first place, it&#39;s your role to stop things
            like this, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll consider this as something you and Ibuki-san started without listening
            to me, so it&#39;s okay. I can just make a concerned face and look worried to put on a show.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kushida says it&#39;s fine too. So, it&#39;s a match!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I won&#39;t do it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? But I came here because I thought I would have a chance to compete. How
            disappointing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She said so and quickly left the bathtub. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Did you really show your face here just for that? Do you like open-air
            baths?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t feel like getting along with you. Outside or inside, it&#39;s all
            the same hot spring, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying she has no intention of staying if there will not be a match, she quickly
            pulls out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That Ibuki-san... what an idiot.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After the sliding doors were strongly shut, Kushida laughed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;She&#39;s weirdly obsessed about having matches with me. You&#39;re also
            similar, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Again and again, Kushida tried to engage in a fight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida laughed after Horikita replied that she was similar to Ibuki. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t put me together with her.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida&#39;s words and expressions said different things, but Horikita ignored
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They expected new visitors so that further conversation would be unnecessary, but it
            is still meal time, so no other students showed up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Still, you were pretty lucky, huh, Horikita-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;And what would you be talking about?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m talking about Ayanokoji-kun being in the seat next to you right after
            you enrolled in the school. Thanks to that, you were able to get close with him, and you were able to
            secretly get a lot of help, right? &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida shouldn&#39;t know the details of how things have been up until now. However,
            she knows that Ayanokoji, in some capacity, was involved. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If it wasn&#39;t for Ayanokoji-kun, you might have been expelled by me now,
            Horikita-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It wasn&#39;t your own strength that let you make it this far. At that time, if she
            was told such a thing, </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita would have immediately objected. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But now, she can calmly see things and look back on them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I suppose I can&#39;t completely deny it. But, I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t good
            luck just for me, but for you</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">also. Without Ayanokoji-kun, the you who has exposed everything wouldn&#39;t be here
            now. You would have kept playing the good guy, and kept repeating the same mistakes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, she doesn&#39;t know the result. There is a good enough chance that
            Kushida would have gotten through her three years of school life under false pretences. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But it is a different matter whether she could keep doing that forever or not.
            Because, in truth, Kushida continued to feel constant pain each and every day. Now, she can disperse her
            stress by having two different sides to her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Perhaps.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The truth that she can be thrusted at by someone she doesn&#39;t like.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida nods, saying that although admission is usually nothing but humiliation,
            there are some things that must be admitted. And that, was only possible because she was pushed to the abyss
            of death in the unanimous special exam, and was able to come back to life.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For the first time in her life, a change came to her mindset and values. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you think about it, maybe you were even luckier than me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s annoying, to be honest. When you make a good come-back like that,
            Horikita-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With this, the two&#39;s words stop. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no particular reason for long baths between people who would not otherwise
            mesh with each other. As such, there was no clear answer as to why they were staying, but leaving first
            would mean losing. Such an atmosphere was the cause of this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Excuse me~&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was only a few minutes after Ibuki&#39;s departure that the two&#39;s time came to
            an end. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose Honami reservedly showed up at the open-air bath. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ichinose-san alone? That&#39;s kind of rare.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A-ha-ha... I guess so, huh.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida knew well that a large crowd of people were talking to her at dinner. From
            that too, it was clear that she showed up here because she wanted to be alone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess there are times when everyone wants to be alone. I&#39;ll go if
            it&#39;s a bother.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For Horikita, for whom the flames were starting to get a little hotter, it was
            decided that this was time for the conclusion. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This was her chance to touch batons with Ichinose and switch. Because after this, she
            estimated that Kushida would only chat about trifling things. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, no! It&#39;s not like that at all! Don&#39;t worry about it!&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose hurriedly stopped Horikita trying to get up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, adding onto this, Kushida turned a smile towards Horikita. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re already up, Horikita-san. Ichinose-san is also saying this, so why
            don&#39;t we chat together?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought we haven&#39;t talked enough yet. No good?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even though she didn&#39;t, Kushida spoke so, as if she meant it from the bottom of
            her heart. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose also gave a slightly uneasy expression, wondering if she had interrupted
            something by coming here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve decided we&#39;ve talked enough, but... fine. I&#39;ll hang out just a
            bit longer, then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, she stood up and sat down on a boulder to cool her body that was burning in the
            night wind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the snow, it was cold outside the bath, but it was actually pleasant. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, I had something to ask you, Ichinose-san. Is that okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hm? Whatever, ask me anything.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is there anyone you&#39;re dating?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm? Ah, huh!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose was in a great panic because a question that she hadn&#39;t even thought of
            came up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Recently, boys in various classes have asked if you&#39;re available, you
            know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida asked so, appearing to not know anything, but the truth was different.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In fact, Ichinose is currently available, and has a favourable attitude towards
            Ayanokoji. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The gathering of such information has been completed early on. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She was more familiar with the situation than anyone in the Ichinose class, but she
            wouldn&#39;t say that out loud. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, there&#39;s not, there&#39;s not!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. Then, is there anyone you like?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The reason that she was talking as if she didn&#39;t know anything was that Kushida
            wanted to learn more about Ayanokoji. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">To find out the reasons why Ichinose has feelings of affection towards Ayanokoji.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She took into account the possibility that it would eventually become her new
            weapon.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, there&#39;s not. Really, there&#39;s nothing like that for me.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, Ichinose refused to accept it, and sank her face in the bath. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s an action to hide her red embarrassed, awkward face. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she admits it here, she could talk about the matter of Karuizawa, or even deeper
            subjects, but that can&#39;t be done so simply. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, she purposefully decided to transfer the conversation onto Horikita. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What about you, Horikita-san? Don&#39;t you have anything to say about
            romance?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Less than even a second later, Horikita responds. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She has little interest in romance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. You seem like you&#39;d be very popular, though. Horikita-san. You seem
            to get along with Sudou-kun too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about that. What about you, actually? You seem close
            to the boys from other classes too. I wonder if Ichinose-san is also curious about that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Facing the dreary question, Horikita returned it as it is. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the aim of quickly removing herself from the conversation and letting the two
            talk. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, right. I get a lot of questions from boys about Kushida-san too, you
            know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While clicking her tongue at Horikita in her mind, Kushida shows a shy smile to
            Ichinose. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..? Really? I don&#39;t really know anything about romance either, so...
            However, I think it would be a waste to fall in love as a student.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Considering that this was an idle chat, Kushida made sure to spread the seeds here.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A waste?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mhm. I mean, I hear that student romances hardly ever come to fruition. About
            10%-30%, I think? When I think that it&#39;s not even half, I don&#39;t really feel like stepping into
            anything... That&#39;s why now I&#39;m conscious as to not fall in love.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She thought that by telling this to Ichinose, who has a wider circle of friends than
            even Kushida, she would be able to kick out the boys in advance who would confess to her with the resolve to
            get rejected.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since enrolling in this school, the number of confessions to Kushida made in the
            shadows has exceeded 10 from all classes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m glad people like me, but... at the same time, I&#39;m afraid of being
            hurt.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right... I think, I get it somehow...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nothing was more futile than a love affair as a student, that&#39;s what Kushida
            thinks. While listening to these two talk about romance, Horikita was about to get up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think I should go now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? You&#39;re leaving already?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about love.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. There&#39;s no helping it, then. But, isn&#39;t there another reason
            that you want to end this?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Forget it. I guess this is too hot for you. I did want to chat a bit more with
            you though, Horikita-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are... are you serious?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course. You think so too, right, Ichinose-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mhm. I still want to talk to Horikita-san too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In response to Kushida&#39;s provocative remarks and leading, Horikita sits back
            down. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s do that, then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As the class leader, her option of escaping Kushida&#39;s invitation
            disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re okay? It would be really bad if you got dizzy and
            collapsed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you for your concern. But, I&#39;m worried about you too, Kushida-san.
            Your face is all red too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe because I was talking about love.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s all? I hope you&#39;re not forcing yourself.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita&#39;s sharp gaze, and Kushida&#39;s smile collide into each other. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you two?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose felt the discomfort and slightly tilted her neck. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seeing that, Kushida completely eliminated the dislike she had left for Horikita.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, no, that&#39;s not true, is it? Right, Horikita-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...That&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no need to give Ichinose additional information, even though she is seen as
            trustworthy. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita also judged so, and followed along. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, for a while, the romance talk between Kushida and Ichinose continued, and
            it eventually turned into idle chatter. </span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 8/images/image4.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita listened on, enjoying the hot springs and the gentle snowfall. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, Ichinose was called back to the room by her friends who had finished
            their meals. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As yet another group of women came to the open-air bath, both Horikita and Kushida
            continued to endure and challenge each other&#39;s patience. And then, after about 10 minutes of
            this...</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe it&#39;s time for both of you to get up? You&#39;re completely red, you
            know?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seeing the two at their limits, Ichinose peeked out from inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right, Horikita-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No... you should listen to Ichinose-san&#39;s words too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They were both trying to cling on in this situation, but the other students who
            finished their meals began to appear in the open-air bath. After this, it became difficult to continue the
            match, so they both read the room and stood up at the same time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It was a nice bath, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It really was. Too much already, actually...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Did something happen between you two after all?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose once again felt a strange atmosphere, but the two left the bath as if
            nothing had happened. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.2p2csry"><span>Part </span><span class="c34">6</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before 10pm. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The guest room&#39;s door was gently knocked twice. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seeing that, Watanabe quickly stood up from the tatami mat, saying that he would
            respond. Did he take the initiative for us, or himself? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kept you waiting.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Together with such a voice, four women entered from the opened door, with Kushida at
            the lead. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;W-Welcome. You&#39;re late, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Must be nervousness and embarrassment. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe suddenly slowed down, and made way for them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry. We spent a little too long in the bath, that&#39;s why we&#39;re
            late.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida, who replied so, definitely had a slightly red face. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, her hair was all smooth. You don&#39;t get many chances to see girls right
            before bedtime. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s precisely why this is such a valuable experience for Watanabe. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the four women coming in, the indescribable fragrance spread to the room
            instantly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not like the gathering of boys stinks, but this is a completely different
            atmosphere. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I wonder why it smells so good now..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, that is a mystery, indeed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The large bathing area was stocked with a large bottle of soy milk shampoo and rinse
            for commercial use.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was no dissatisfaction, but the foaming was not particularly good, and it felt
            like it was relatively inexpensive. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Normally, I think the same thing is placed in the women&#39;s public baths too,
            but... The scent that drifts from them is obviously different from the same soy milk shampoo. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps they brought it in themselves. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, please ask them. How can they smell so good?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry, but I can&#39;t really ask that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if I lack common sense, I knew better than to ask. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I think that if I make such a statement, they&#39;ll definitely be creeped out.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When you think that this is the boys&#39; room, it&#39;s a bit exciting,
            huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amikura uncomfortably whispered so, to the other girls, looking around the room.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The floor plan of the room is the same, but it may look strangely different. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When the discussion is over, why don&#39;t we go to Honami and the others&#39;
            room later? I heard the girls are gathered all the way up until sleep time.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Really? Yeah, I&#39;m totally fine. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unlike Kushida, who pleasantly agreed, Nishino refused without showing interest.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll pass. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m good friends with them.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Following along, Yamamura also lowered her head and whispered. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Me too, I&#39;ll pass...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is that so? I think everyone would be welcome, but... Well, that&#39;s
            fine.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Knowing that the girls would disperse soon, Watanabe looked sad. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The lights out time seems to be a little late at 11pm, so there is still time to
            spare. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a special school trip, so everyone wants to avoid awkward situations.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So this is how it feels to have girls in your room...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In a daze because of the girls, Watanabe quietly whispered so.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Anyway, Watanabe. You&#39;d better start following up with the girls. Isn&#39;t
            this your chance to increase your likability?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Me, Ryuen, or even Kitou could invite them into the room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, he has to take a step forward to make an impression</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? Follow? Follow what?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Still in shock because of the girls&#39; appearance, it seems that Watanabe
            couldn&#39;t see the situation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The girls, coming to an away match in the boys&#39; room, were lost as to where they
            should gather.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[TL Note 16 - The word &quot;match&quot; isn&#39;t included but &quot;away&quot; is
            as it is in the original. It&#39;s a sports reference, when a team is having a match in another team&#39;s
            stadium it&#39;s an away match.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Um... where should we sit?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Japanese-style room already has four futons laid out by the staff with a little
            space between them, so you have to move to the edge of the tatami mats to sit on the floor. It&#39;s a show
            of skill whether to force them into a tight corner or to take other steps. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? Anywhere is fine, right? I&#39;m fine with sitting on a futon too, you
            know?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Waranabe didn&#39;t seem to understand things, so he took two futon blankets, and
            prepared a space. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The girls looked a little surprised, but there was no other suitable place, and
            Kushida showed agreement. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On two futons close to the entrance, each of the four sits down. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well then, the lights are almost out, so let&#39;s start right away. Wait,
            where&#39;s Ryuen-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Beyond the shoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 17 : &#38556;&#23376; Shoji, traditional paper sliding door]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The closed shoji opens up to a small table, two single person sofas, and a small
            refrigerator. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Amikura was scared of going to the shoji, her classmate Nishino vigorously opened
            the shoji on her behalf. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen seemed to be relaxed, sitting on the one person sofa while playing with his
            phone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You heard, right? Come on.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s fine here, isn&#39;t it? I can hear just fine.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That may be so, but I hope you can come over to everyone because this is also
            to increase the sense of unity of the group.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without fear, Kushida called out to Ryuen to tell him to come over. Perhaps annoyed
            by Kushida, Ryuen turned off his phone screen while laughing. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You seem to be getting ahead of yourself, but you know your position,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean, I wonder?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Just as I said. If you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t understand, then I can make
            you understand, you know?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The other students can&#39;t understand why Ryuen was saying this to her. Ryuen is
            the one person outside the class who knows Kushida best, so his words were heavy.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if taking this as a simple quarrel, Nishino approached Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Stop saying annoying things, and just come over here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nishino was not frightened or timid, and she was already grabbing his arm and pulling
            him up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Nishino. You&#39;ve been saying a lot too lately, haven&#39;t you?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve always been like this, though? I just didn&#39;t get involved more
            than I needed to.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She must mean that she&#39;s in a group now, so it can&#39;t be helped. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought that things would get even more tense from here, but Ryuen annoyedly got up
            and stepped towards the Japanese-style room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Kitou turned his gaze, the atmosphere instantly became tense.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Still, for the time being, it is true that eight people were now gathered in one room
            for the discussion. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you all really need to be here? We could do this on the phone.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou, who hadn&#39;t uttered a word since the girls arrived, asked so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, if we made a group on an app, it would be simple to talk with everyone.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like the other groups are meeting face-to-face and making up their
            minds as well.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wow, you know everything, Kushida-chan.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe sat between me and Yamamura with an exaggerated nod, impressed by the flow
            of information. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps alarmed by the unexpected sudden approach of a boy, Yamamura took a half step
            back to get away from Watanabe. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, sorry, Yamamura. Didn&#39;t see you there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No... please don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apart from such a trivial exchange, there was still a strong sense of tension because
            of the interaction with Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t care about other people. We can do things our way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It must be Ryuen that Kitou is worried about. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can clearly see that he is afraid it will not be a proper discussion. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s important to meet face to face, isn&#39;t it? I wanna hear
            everyone&#39;s true opinions, you know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida replies that there are things you can&#39;t understand with an app, and
            doesn&#39;t seem to be pulling back. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida probably didn&#39;t want to step on the landmine that is Ryuen either, but
            she has to protect her own position. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If Kushida decides not to back down here, I&#39;m sure he will just push forward.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well then, let&#39;s talk about the free time tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[TL Note 18 - There is a word used that is like &quot;after&quot; or &quot;from
            after&quot; but it doesn&#39;t work in english with this context so I left it out now.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;More importantly, you forgot about something we gotta decide
            first.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Looking over the Japanese-style room lined up with futons, Ryuen opened his mouth.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t want to sleep side by side with you bastards, but the space is
            limited, so... I&#39;ll be sleeping here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the end of his gaze, was the futon at the far end of the room. It is ideally
            positioned so that if someone wakes up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet or such, there would
            be no disturbance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, we haven&#39;t decided who will sleep where yet. No, but, do we have to
            decide that now?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I think it&#39;s better to make a decision after the girls go back, but... Is he
            simply unable to read the room, or has he spoken out now deliberately?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Considering how Ryuen has been so far, I can&#39;t help but feel that it is the
            latter. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, on the other hand, what about the people around? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Clearly, after that remark, everyone thought that he was being selfish and speaking
            out of place.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No objections, yeah?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He glanced at me and Watanabe for a moment and slightly strengthened his tone of
            voice. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I... Well, I&#39;m okay anywhere.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Like a frog against a snake, Watanabe accepted. Now, what would I say? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While I was thinking about it, Ryuen had already cut his gaze off from me. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yo, Kitou. If you have something to say, you can say it, you know?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that he thinks Kitou is the only one who would disagree. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I won&#39;t accept it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A rebuttal to symbolize it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He told Kitou he should speak, but Ryuen leaned his head, not liking the refusal.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I won&#39;t agree with something unfair like that. Besides, we shouldn&#39;t
            discuss it now. Don&#39;t you even get that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn. I don&#39;t remember giving you a right to refuse, you
            bastard.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m free to speak how I want, where I want.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou did not step back, rather, he entered a state of confrontation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Come on now, Kitou, calm down. It&#39;s just a sleeping place, why don&#39;t
            you let him have it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I refuse.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ugh...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who stood up and tried to stop this, sat back down after an intense glare.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In terms of the rage on his face, Kitou surpasses Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not gonna let this man get away with being irrational.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, come on, boys. We&#39;re not talking about that now, so you
            can...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amikura timidly tried to warn them, but Nishino pulled the sleeve of her yukata and
            stopped her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In that case, let&#39;s do this. Are you all gonna fight over it
            too?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll refrain from that... I said it before, but I&#39;m fine
            anywhere.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I personally prefer to be on the edge rather than being pinched between, I hate to be
            caught up in trouble. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether the winner is Ryuen or Kitou, when one of them takes the edge, the two will
            no longer sleep next to each other. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Rather, the possibility that I or Watanabe would be caught between them as cushioning
            is higher. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll pass too. Fight as you want and decide. However, if you two want that
            edge spot, Watanabe and I can take whichever one we want from the remaining three, alright?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you do not claim your natural rights, you will struggle again later. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They both want the same futon, so Watanabe and I should be free to choose from the
            free spots. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Also, Please don&#39;t decide this with violence.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I don&#39;t say this strongly, group 6 will stand out in a bad way.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I heard that the groups causing trouble will be relentlessly restricted. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a special school trip, so it would be a shame to not be able to leave the
            ryokan because things got a little out of hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I like fighting better since that&#39;s easy to understand for me, but I guess
            we can&#39;t do that, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For now, I&#39;m glad that they will refrain from using violence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thanks, Ayanokoji, for saying what I wanted to say.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, it&#39;s not like I said anything significant.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s not true, though. Actually, yeah. You can sleep on the
            edge.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Are the only fundamentally good people here from the Ichinose class? Even though I
            didn&#39;t ask for any help,</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He said so and gave me the edge spot. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With this, from the back, it&#39;s Ryuen or Kitou, and Watanabe by their side.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The loser of the match will get the third one. We agreed that I will sleep on the end
            closest to the entrance.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I gotta show a little endurance too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, one of the reasons for giving up was for personal reasons. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure being caught between Ryuen and Kitou would be too much of a thrill too.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When you say school trip, I guess this is all that comes to mind,
            huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before long, a pillow was clutched in Ryuen&#39;s hands. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a face to face match. I don&#39;t have to explain the rules, right?
            Kitou.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What is it? What are you going to do with that pillow?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not knowing what was waiting after this change, I tilted my neck. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When you combine a school trip and pillows, there&#39;s only one thing,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Only one thing?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t get it at all... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, the students other than me seem to understand and, and Kushida quickly gets
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, then, I&#39;ll be the referee, okay? I think that it would be best for
            someone to watch over this in an impartial way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida, who seems to regret being in such a ridiculous place, spoke out as such.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even at a time like this, you&#39;re so disciplined, huh,
            Kushida-chan?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I want to know the truth, but other than Watanabe, there are other girls around.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">More importantly, I&#39;m deeply interested in what they will use the pillow for.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll give you the first attack.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Nah, you don&#39;t wanna be defeated without firing a single shot, do you? Come
            at me with no regrets, Ryuen.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen laughed as he bounced the pillow over his hands. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In that case, I&#39;ll kill you without hesitation, Kitou!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, he swung his pillow and threw it like a ball. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The pillow stuffed with buckwheat chaff attacks Kitou at high speed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Though there is plenty of distance between the two, the throw is so strong that he
            could suddenly lose the match.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou calmly and surely caught the pillow. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll kill you!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This time, Kitou himself swung and threw the pillow back with the same force. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen on the other side, again, elegantly caught the pillow, and instantly shifted to
            a pitching stance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Not bad, Kitou! Looks like we can have a little fun, huh!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Again, the pillow is returned. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This is...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s pillow throwing. Haven&#39;t you done it before, Ayanokoji-kun? I
            thought that all the boys were doing it in school trips in elementary school and junior high school, and
            outdoor schools. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">First time I&#39;m hearing of it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 20 : Expression, &#21021;&#32819; Hatsumimi, lit. &quot;First
            Ear&quot;]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Last year&#39;s training camp didn&#39;t have anyone throwing pillows either. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Darkness Ball!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;My mad, raging serpent... devour him!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Darkness, serpent... that pillow is being turned into a lot of different things, huh.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, this is pillow throwing... right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A one-on-one match where outsiders aren&#39;t allowed to be tagged in... no, a pillow
            throwing match. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amikura muttered as pillows were being thrown left and right. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From then on, the deadly battle lasted for a few minutes with no signs of a
            conclusion. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both of them had no problem with draining their energy, and seemed like they would be
            able to continue fighting for longer. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Here, however, all of us except those two find ourselves in a tight spot.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That pillow, is it okay to keep throwing it strongly like that? It&#39;s
            already in tatters.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After Kushida&#39;s silently muttered remark, everyone&#39;s gazes were taken by the
            pillow. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no need to explain this to anyone, but pillows aren&#39;t tools to be used
            for throwing.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Leaving aside some light throwing, with a series of blazing fastballs and further
            being caught with no insignificant power, there is no way damage wouldn&#39;t accumulate. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;By the way, whose pillow is that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After Watanabe&#39;s remark, we quickly checked the futon laid on the ground. From
            the four futons, the pillow from the one on the edge that was given to me by Watanabe had disappeared.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Is that mine?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The pillow that should have been on my futon wasn&#39;t there. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">And now, Kitou seemed to be further putting the power of darkness into the pillow
            held in his hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I could tell the pillow was screaming.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you sleep on that pillow, you&#39;ll probably have nightmares.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No, in the first place, I&#39;m afraid that there is no guarantee the pillow will
            stay in shape. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter who wins, I want it to be returned safely.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmph!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A pillow, with an unprecedented, intense killer intent put into it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because of Kitou&#39;s thick fingers strongly digging into it, it burst the moment it
            left his hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The buckwheat that was clogged in the broken cloth was scattered in the room. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Along with the sound of it scattering around, everyone fell into silence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The pillow that was supposed to gently support my head, turned into an atrocious
            shape. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My pillow, I wished for it strongly, but it couldn&#39;t return to me safely...
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I would like to express my condolences to the victims that were cruelly scattered on
            the battlefield. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Boys are... they&#39;re such pure children, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Kushida muttered so in a way only I could hear, the scattered buckwheat chaff also
            became silent. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The two did not seem to care, and an index finger reached out to a nearby untouched
            pillow, but Nishino then sternly raised her voice. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Listen... We have things to do, so can&#39;t you finish this later? This is
            annoying.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ignoring that warning, Ryuen wanted to continue, but Kitou seemed to be different.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He silently sat on the spot, and decided to pause for a while. His hot thoughts
            cooled down, and I felt the discontent around me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can we say it&#39;s your loss, then? Kitou.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If she says this is a bother, then I have no intention of
            continuing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From the atmosphere he usually lets out, I could not imagine it, but he quickly
            pulled out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, if this was going to happen, I wish they hadn&#39;t done this from the start.
            At least the victims from the pillow which have been cruelly scattered around would have remained safe.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well then... let&#39;s start talking when we&#39;re done cleaning
            up.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the help of all the boys and girls except Ryuen, we successfully collected the
            remains of the pillow without spending too much time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ll have to get a new pillow from someone from the ryokan later. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Should I be honest, or should I lie? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The scattered buckwheat chaff, we put them in a clear plastic bag set in the trash
            can, and started our discussion.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;About the free conduct, we just have to return to the ryokan by the final
            dinner reception, 18:00, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As expected, Kushida first started speaking for the group. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mhm. That&#39;s why it really feels like a day of freedom.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amikura also immediately began talking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think we can gather on a train or a bus and depart that way, but what should
            we do? Is there some place you want to go to, Nishino-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess I wanna ski. All I&#39;ve done so far is practice, and I am in
            Hokkaidou, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I agree with Nishino&#39;s opinion.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Despite going to the trouble of learning how to ski, it would be a waste to end it
            after half a day. Silently, Kitou also lightly raised his hand and showed agreement. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There are quite a few people who want to ski, huh? Watanabe-kun, Yamamura-san,
            what about you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t think I have any objections either. We&#39;re going downtown on the
            third day, so why not?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m fine anywhere.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura, who still can&#39;t ski well, doesn&#39;t seem to particularly dislike the
            idea either. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Maybe she is just trying to match her surroundings, or perhaps she wants to get
            better at skiing.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t really see much emotion in that area, though. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm... I&#39;m not so good at skiing, so I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m happy about
            it, but... If everyone wants to ski, then that&#39;s fine with me. It&#39;s a group, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying so, she shows her concession. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida did not answer her own question, but looked at Ryuen sitting on the one man
            sofa. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What about you, Ryuen-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whatever.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without insisting on anything particular, he lightly relinquished his right to speak.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After Ryuen, the most troublesome member, made such a decision, an air of relief
            flowed through the group. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would be better to think that Ryuen is also aiming to enjoy skiing, rather than
            having no interest in going anywhere.</span></p>
