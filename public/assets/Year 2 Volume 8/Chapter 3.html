    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The morning of the second day of the school trip. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After having breakfast and getting dressed, we spent time relaxing in the room
            until
            the departure time of the bus to the ski resort. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe and I were casually watching TV. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Beyond the screen, entertainers are reading out all the news from this morning
            and
            responding with honest comments.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After a while, it broke into the kitten&#39;s feature corner and the atmosphere
            changed dramatically. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Ryuen in the same room is sitting on the one person sofa, as if it was
            his
            own sofa, and Kitou is looking at a stack of magazines that are available for free rental at the
            inn, one at
            a time.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that they are all fashion magazines. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He looks way too restless to be just reading a magazine... It looks like
            he&#39;s reading a murder manual.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I heard Watanabe say so. He probably whispered so that he couldn&#39;t be heard,
            but
            sharp eyes glanced at Watanabe in an instant. Perhaps scared by this, he hid in my shadow and
            blocked the
            gaze. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He&#39;s definitely done that to some people, right? Right?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My shoulders are being shaked, but I&#39;d like to be allowed to concentrate on
            the
            cat feature on the TV. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, Kitou. You&#39;re not satisfied with yesterday&#39;s pillow throwing,
            right? Have a match against me today.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if to bring a storm in on a peaceful morning, Ryuen said so and brought a
            suggestion to Kitou. It goes without saying that for me or Watanabe, it wasn&#39;t something to
            be welcomed.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Fool. Are you jumping into certain death yourself? If you want to regret
            it,
            then I won&#39;t stop you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He-he, try to make me regret it, then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What kind of match do you want?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re going to ski now, so it&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that he wants a simple &lsquo;time attack&rsquo; race about who finishes
            skiing first.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou is probably not a novice either, but at least it&#39;s clear from yesterday
            that Ryuen&#39;s skills are high. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no need to go out of your way to go along with a strategy that is meant
            to
            drag you into someone else&#39;s playing field. However, as expected, Kitou quickly closed the
            magazine.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You think you can win if it&#39;s skiing? I&#39;ll crush that idea of
            yours.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seeming to accept it, he doesn&#39;t show any attitude of trying to escape.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You shouldn&#39;t cause too many problems, you know? Hey, are you two
            listening?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t think he can hear that warning.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe&#39;s voice volume was so low that a child might say, &quot;An ant is
            talking!&quot;. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was sitting next to him and could only just barely make out what he was saying.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I can imagine how pathetic you&#39;ll look crawling on the
            slope.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ridiculous.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They&#39;re both heating up as they interact with each other. As Kitou stood up,
            he
            rolled up the borrowed magazine and approached Ryuen with it in his hand, sticking up the tip of
            the
            magazine like a sword. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When you lose, you&#39;ll be as quiet as a borrowed cat the whole
            trip.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if unknowingly inspired by the cat feature on television, he taunted him.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? If you ask me, I&#39;ve been quiet enough already.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a slap, he swiftly swiped off the magazine. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can we just leave it at that? I want to watch the cat feature.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I said so and urged the two to keep their distance from each other. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wow, that&#39;s some big talk, Ayanokoji. Aren&#39;t you afraid that
            they&#39;ll target you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t think so. There is no merit for those two to go after someone
            like
            me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unless I butt in too much, this will remain as Ryuen versus Kitou until the end.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Anyway, they seem to have gone quiet, so I&#39;ll continue watching
            the-&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just as I thought so, before I knew it, the cats had disappeared from the TV.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, it was not a very long special feature, and it was over in just a few
            minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;What a shame, Ayanokoji. You liked cats, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, not really.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t like them!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I just wanted to see them, it isn&#39;t as if I hold any particular love for the
            animal called cat.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I would have felt the same way if this was a dog feature, or even a hippo
            feature.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The program was cheerful for a while, but then, the breaking news came in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We will continue with the news, then. Former Secretary General Naoe passed
            away
            at a hospital in Tokyo after a long period of medical treatment. Comments from Prime Minister
            Kijima from
            his office:&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With numerous flashes, a stern-looking man begins to speak. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Try a horse by riding him, and judge a man by living with him. These are
            the
            words that Naoe Sensei told me, shortly after we met.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Prime Minister began to talk about the deceased, and then, poof, the screen
            blacked out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s time for the bus.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou, holding the remote control with his index finger on the power button,
            called
            out to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s go, Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I am a little concerned about the two of them, but I&#39;ll still enjoy skiing.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.1hmsyys"><span>Part </span><span class="c15">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We went outside, but there was a little trouble waiting for us. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, the bus was caught in traffic, and would arrive around 10 minutes
            late.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There are a lot of students waiting for a bus to go to the ski resort, and if you
            look back, there are people flooding back into the entrance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s cold, so it&#39;s hard to wait outside.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe looked up at the sky with melancholy, exhaling a white breath. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I regret that we got out a little earlier than the other students, but
            there&#39;s
            nothing to do about it now.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if we go back to our room, we can&#39;t relax with 5 minutes left. As group
            6,
            we decided to wait near the building for the bus to come.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, we&#39;re out here, so why don&#39;t we make a snowman?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to use this waiting time effectively, Amikura suggested so to the
            group.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That sounds like fun. Nishino-san, Yamamura-san, won&#39;t you join
            us?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;... well, okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was Nishino who I thought would refuse, but she replied lightly with an okay.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, I... I don&#39;t want to.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As expected, she said no, although it was somewhat modest. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The three girls moved to an unobstructed position and started piling up the
            snow.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Apparently, they&#39;re not going to make one of a small size, but rather a
            big
            one. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, Ryuen-kun, why don&#39;t you come over here and make a snowman with
            us? I
            think it&#39;s fun!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Knowing that he would never take her up on her proposal, Kushida, showing her
            good
            heart, invited Ryuen to join him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The students around the school were also watching the developments with concern,
            perhaps because they couldn&#39;t imagine Ryuen working to build a snowman. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This statement is definitely yesterday&#39;s revenge. Showing that if you make a
            careless statement, you will be resolutely challenged.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought it would be nice to keep a little restraint, but did I read
            things
            wrong?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen muttered, as if talking to himself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Certainly, if it was Kushida before her true nature was known to her classmates,
            she
            might have endured. She would have felt uncomfortable, but here he could not unravel the
            mystery. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because she can&#39;t give them information that the rest of the classes
            doesn&#39;t
            know, such as the exchange in the Unanimous Special Exam.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Needless to say, Kushida&#39;s invitation was not likely to be accepted by Ryuen.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without reacting to the snowman, he looked in another direction.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, some people continued to gaze quietly at the snowman which was
            being made. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was Yamamura who took a little distance from us before I noticed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Haa...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While watching the production of Kushida&rsquo;s snowman, she was exhaling
            coldly.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Haa..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida and the others making the snowman are naturally wearing gloves. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I looked around, other than Yamamura, there were no students outside with
            bare
            hands. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course. In this cold weather, unless there is a special reason, you can&#39;t
            stay
            with bare hands for long. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I remember Yamamura wearing gloves before taking the ski class yesterday. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if she can rent ski gloves, why didn&#39;t she take her gloves with her when
            going to a ski resort? If she&#39;s forgotten, she can just go back and get them, so maybe
            there&#39;s a
            reason. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She looks dizzy, staring outward as she exhales repeatedly. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although I was concerned about Yamamura, more and more students were beginning to
            come outside while waiting for the bus.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s snow all around, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The familiar voice belongs to Sakayanagi Arisu. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Someone from group 4. It should be Hondou and Onodera elected from the Horikita
            Class.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I remembered that, she kept standing there, as if waiting for an
            answer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi can&#39;t ski, so she&#39;ll probably go to sightseeing spots. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without really involving themselves with the members of group 6, Sakayanagi and
            the
            others had all gathered together.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Eventually, before the bus to the ski resort, the bus heading downtown
            arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the leading teacher instructed them to get in, the students began to embark
            one
            after the other.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi, walking along the unfamiliar snow trail with her cane. As I watched,
            I
            wondered if my prediction of the future had come true, and Sakayanagi slipped and fell lightly
            on her
            buttocks. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Fortunately, the snow cushion seems to have protected her from the impact and she
            is
            not in pain.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Are you alright..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 8/images/image6.webp" title=""></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Shortly after, a C-Class member of the same 4th group rushes over. He hesitated
            for a
            moment, but then reached out.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you very much, Tokitou-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While shyly thanking him, she grabbed the hand that she had been offered. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is easy to forcefully pull up the smaller Sakayanagi, but Tokitou did so
            carefully
            and slowly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Despite his stern face, he is a surprisingly sensitive and caring helper. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t force yourself. You&#39;ve got a bad leg, right..?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry. But fortunately, the snow was soft and it didn&#39;t hurt.
            &rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s not really the problem...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although Sakayanagi usually wields relentless strategies as the class leader,
            group
            members from other classes may feel that the impression is very different. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi, who stood up while grabbing her staff, thanked him again. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It was nothing... I&#39;m just glad it wasn&#39;t anything
            big.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Embarrassed, he let his gaze away, unable to look directly at Sakayanagi. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought you were a scary person, Tokitou-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? Me? ...no, well...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi stopped and started talking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s as if the exchange is a showcase of the changing nature of the
            relationship.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because you usually walk across the corridor with a scary look on your
            face.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, how do you even know that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Asked this question, Sakayanagi answered without pause and with a smile on her
            face.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re both second years. I know a lot about you,
            Tokitou-kun.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If they were an ordinary boy and girl in an ordinary high school, it would be a
            scene
            that would give rise to misunderstandings. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Behind that smile, however, there is always the possibility that Sakayanagi&#39;s
            wits and tricks are at play. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even falling down may have been a calculated event. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The only students present who were thinking about such a thing were probably me
            and
            Ryuen, who was ostensibly looking at them with disinterest. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi and Tokitou lined up and proceeded to the bus to board it, with
            Sakayanagi
            getting on first. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tokitou probably wanted to support her in case she fell behind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether or not there is another side to this, it is clear that those who normally
            have no contact with each other are gradually beginning to close the distance between them.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After a delay, the buses to the ski resort also arrived, replacing the buses to
            the
            city center.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.41mghml"><span>Part 2</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got off the direct bus that took us to the ski slopes, the eight of us
            decided not to go into the ski resort immediately but to take a stroll nearby. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was not planned, but since there were several souvenir shops around the area
            from
            the bus, it began with Amikura&#39;s offer after noticing them. It&#39;s not like the skis will
            run off
            after 20 or 30 minutes, so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whoah ~ It&#39;s so cold in the morning here. The inside of the car was
            warm,
            so I can feel the extra temperature difference.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying so, Kushida rubbed her gloves together and shook her body. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right. This cold at the end of November is very surprising. It
            also
            feels strange that there&#39;s snow.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you want to look around, just do it quickly. Though, I&#39;m sure
            everything
            is still closed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Having said that, Ryuen called out to the group that was stopping. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The time is still just after 9:15. The ski slopes open at 9:30, but the shops
            around
            them are still largely closed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for Ryuen, I guess he intends to just enjoy skiing for the day, and it looks
            like
            he will stay and wait for the slopes to open. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Among the few stores already open at this point in time is an unusual apparel
            store,
            and for some reason Kitou quickly approached it and started staring at the clothes
            inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A lot of flashy and unusual clothes are on display, but I guess he was wondering
            if
            there is anything he&#39;d like.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just as I thought so, he put back the clothes he had in his hand, and started
            searching for others.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Still, your feet are huge, Kitou. It&#39;s like the footprints of a
            snowman.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe was impressed to see the footprints of the snow that lasted up to the
            apparel store, and compared them to his size. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although Kitou is tall, even without taking this into account, it seems certain
            that
            the footprints are large. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s all go.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The one who came up with the idea, Amikura, said so, and walked off in a hurry.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida immediately took the invitation from Amikura, but it seems that Yamamura
            is
            going to refuse and stay here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that Watanabe and Nishino also decided to walk individually. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura-san? You&#39;re not going?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;... oh, I&#39;ll stay... Please don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Only me, Ryuen, and Yamamura remained.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I really wanted to look around with Amikura and the others, but I missed the wave
            because I didn&#39;t hear anything like &quot;would you like to come with me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now, what should I do? I could go around by myself like Watanabe and the
            others...
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After Yamamura refrained from the invite, she intends to stay here and wait for
            her
            companions to return. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I leave, she&#39;ll be left alone with Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would have been fine if these two got along, but they had almost never met
            each
            other before. I can&#39;t imagine them getting along with each other, so it would be cruel to
            leave. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Therefore, unless Yamamura or Ryuen begin to act alone, it would be correct to
            remain, although frustrating. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura shuddered as she looked at Amikura and the others, whose backs are
            getting
            smaller and smaller. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The cause, after all, is her hands hidden inside her coat. It is almost certain
            that
            she has come this far without gloves. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So, should I lend them to her?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, if she refuses to accept, it will be a little awkward. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou and the group 6 had already left, and the situation is quiet, with just the
            three of us. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura seemed to be trying to endure the cold as much as she could, but she
            still
            couldn&#39;t hide it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, Yamamura, take out your hands.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I continued to wonder whether I should call out to her, Ryuen instructed
            Yamamura
            in a tight tone, who was standing there with her hands in the inside pockets of her coat.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, Ryuen noticed the coldness of Yamamura and the unnaturalness of her
            keeping her hands in her coat. I thought that her cold hands would come out, &nbsp;but Yamamura
            averted her
            gaze, and... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although it was a quiet voice, she turned him down completely. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t want to take them out. Because it&#39;s cold.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She did not mention whether or not she is wearing gloves, but stated a reason.
            You
            can feel the cool breeze even through the gloves in Hokkaido. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So it is certain that if you put your hands inside your coat, they will be
            warmer.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought this was the end of it, but Ryuen stepped on the snow path and came
            over to
            Yamamura. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he grabbed her right arm and forced it out of her pocket. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah~&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Confirmed that she was not wearing gloves, Yamamura rushed to hide her hands in
            her
            coat when Ryuen let go of her arm. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That must be cold. What happened to your gloves?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen confirmed that she is bare-handed, but Yamamura did not answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Turning her back, as if saying to leave her alone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re not even good at this, and you want to hurt yourself by
            paralyzing
            your hands?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen made a valid point. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;As a beginner, Yamamura must not even be satisfied with her skiing yet.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In such a situation, if your hands are useless due to the cold, you will not be
            able
            to make progress. On the contrary, it only increases the risk of falling.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you get seriously injured and make a fuss, my skiing will be cancelled.
            Can
            you take that responsibility?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Emphasising his own skiing, it sounded like a mixture of Ryuen-like egotism and
            clumsy kindness. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, that&#39;s...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura seemed unable to talk back on an issue that was not merely a matter of
            emotion. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So... Gloves?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I forgot them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ha, who would be so stupid?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Under this cold weather, no one will forget their gloves. Laughing with his nose,
            Ryuen lowered his gaze to his own gloves. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No way, does he intend to lend his gloves to Yamamura?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yo, Ayanokoji. Give her your damn gloves.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Come on, me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He didn&#39;t just show such gentle development and threw the whole thing over to
            me.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But I&#39;m a novice skier too?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re injured, it&#39;s no problem.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t quite understand what the rationale is, but... Unfortunately, the
            store
            that sells gloves around here doesn&#39;t seem to be open. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In that case, I&#39;ll have to lend these to Yamamura. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There may be special gloves in the ski resort, but even 10 or 15 minutes of
            warmth
            would make some difference. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m fine, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura is already exhaling as she distanced herself by saying so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;d suggest you stop. Cold causes vasoconstriction. Your body is
            shaking
            because your muscles are reacting to raise your body temperature. It might be dangerous to start
            skiing in
            that condition. Wouldn&#39;t it be most frustrating if things turn out like Ryuen said they
            would?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I hal forced the gloves I removed onto Yamamura. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But... what about you, Ayanokoji-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s most important that you don&#39;t do anything to
            injure
            yourself while skiing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They don&#39;t have a special resistance to cold, but as Ryuen says, if you
            control
            it with technique, it won&#39;t be a problem. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...sorry about this...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With gratitude, Yamamura put on the pair of large gloves, her hands trembling
            slightly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, she put her hands inside her coat again. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They will remain cold for a while, but after a few minutes it will improve.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Later, you&#39;ll need to buy a new pair of gloves of your
            size.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Okay. Um, when we get to the ski resort, please let me pay for your gloves,
            Ayanokoji-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Pay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve already worn them, so it would be rude to return them now.
            They&#39;re
            dirty.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;d get dirty. No, you don&#39;t have to worry
            about
            falling down and dirtying them, just return them to me as they are.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That isn&#39;t what I mean. When I put things on, they get dirty,
            so...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Does she have a germophobic way of thinking? No, but Yamamura wore the gloves
            without
            resistance, albeit reservedly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t understand her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I want you to let me pay for them, after all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When it came to reimbursement for the gloves, I don&#39;t think she would
            blatantly
            choose the cheapest ones and return them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would be too high an expense for actions for which reimbursement is
            unnecessary.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;ll just be a waste of private points. There is no need to do
            something
            like that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Won&#39;t you be disgusted by the gloves?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Again, I don&#39;t understand what she is saying. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Why would the gloves end up becoming disgusting, just because Yamamura wore them?
            Even if this was not Yamamura, I would have felt the same way. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s okay. It would be worse to make a weird fuss about it and pay for
            it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I expressed myself firmly to show that I would be uncomfortable if she
            paid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then, let me at least give you a different kind of thanks.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&#39;t think a thank you was necessary, but maybe I should do something to
            make
            the Yamamura feel better. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she is going to be so stubborn, should I provide her with a path that is
            acceptable to her? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then, in exchange for a thank you, can I ask you a question?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Yes?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is there a reason that you weren&#39;t wearing gloves since the time we
            were
            waiting for the bus in the morning?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I just forgot.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I know that she didn&#39;t leave her hands bare on purpose. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You had as much time as you needed to go back to get them. Did you forget
            that
            too?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took another step and asked what I was curious about. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;... because it wasn&#39;t that kind of atmosphere...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Atmosphere?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It felt like it would be hard to come back.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is true that there were a lot of students in the lobby, but I doubt it would
            be
            that hard to come back. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No, that&#39;s just how I feel, and I have to look at it differently from how
            Yamamura feels. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was only a few minutes of interaction, but I could understand a little bit of
            the
            student called Yamamura. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, I was interested. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura, who do you hang out with the most?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">What kind of students do these types of students make friends with? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Are they the same quiet kids or are they in a circle of popular people like
            Kushida
            who welcomes everyone? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Or are they the type of people who avoid others?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura, however, did not answer the question immediately. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her expression didn&#39;t change much, but she narrowed her eyes slightly
            awkwardly.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No one in particular. I spend most of my time alone. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;By yourself? I don&#39;t think they&#39;d leave anyone alone in
            A-Class.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have a faint presence, so... they don&#39;t even notice that I am by
            myself.
            It&#39;s an everyday occurrence, so I&#39;m not particularly concerned about it.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is true that there are those with a faint presence who are overshadowed by
            others.
            If asked which one I am, I would be classified as that type too. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the case of me and Yamamura, however, we are likely to have completely
            different
            characters. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Thinking about it, if Kushida noticed that Yamamura was cold, there was no way
            she
            would ignore it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even Kushida, who is always concerned about the reactions of others, seems to
            have
            become desensitized to Yamamura&#39;s shadowy presence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, if she in fact has such a faint presence, I don&#39;t think anyone would
            have
            paid much attention to her going back to her gloves. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The faintness of her presence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I analyze it objectively, I can see some of her true character too. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura, do you like yourself?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t like myself at all. It&#39;s impossible. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura answered honestly, maybe because of the weakness of having to borrow
            gloves.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the thing you want to hide is yourself, that is one of the causes for you
            having
            a faint presence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you don&#39;t want to let people see you or to show yourself, you will
            inevitably
            act inconspicuously. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She hides behind someone in a conversation so they don&#39;t see her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s like wearing black clothes in the middle of the night and not knowing
            why
            you don&#39;t stand out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Also, because she does not make unnecessary movements, there are fewer chances
            for
            her to be seen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her presence is as faint as possible. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Moreover, Yamamura seems to be twice as vigilant towards people. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, she is afraid of the other party and has saved their
            assertiveness as
            long as possible.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The combination of these factors has resulted in the creation of a student called
            Yamamura who is not easily recognized because of her faint presence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The problem is that even if the cause is known, it cannot be solved immediately.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura would only become more vigilant if I said something like this, which you
            would not usually say to someone you have nothing to do with.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Words coming from someone closer to you are easier to accept. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After all, our conversation ended here, and we went silent. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, about 10 minutes later, everyone came back just before the opening. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So, how do we divide? We don&#39;t all have to ski together,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Group conduct is required, but we don&#39;t have to match every detail with each
            other. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is a mix of beginner and advanced skiers, and it&#39;s hard, or even rude
            for
            everyone to fit in with everyone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The important thing is balance. Whether it can be judged as reasonable when the
            surroundings see it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We&#39;ll probably have to think about splitting up the team, starting with the
            least
            skilled of the eight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura and I are set for the beginner course, but what should we do?
            Should
            we go together?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">First of all, there is a gentle course for beginners underneath the ski slope, so
            it
            is definitely necessary for the two of us to ski there. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura also immediately agreed to Watanabe&#39;s offer. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think it would be good for someone who can ski to follow along with
            Yamamura
            and Watanabe. I could do it, if you want.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, it&#39;s okay, Kushida-san. I&#39;ll do it at the beginners&#39; place.
            &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? You sure?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can ski without worrying about it. I know I can ski, but the advanced
            course is still a little scary for me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nishino was able to ski normally, but said that and offered to follow
            Yamamura.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not sure about the advanced course either...alright, let&#39;s do
            that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps Amikura had intended to do so from the beginning, but as soon as Nishino
            answered, she told so to everyone around her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unexpectedly, we agreed to split into groups of four people each and ski in
            different
            courses. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you feel like skiing on a course above intermediate level, you can
            always
            say so. I&#39;ll be around to support you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In case Nishino and Amikura were holding themselves back from saying anything,
            Kushida added so.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, lunch is at noon. Let&#39;s all meet at the restaurant.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the group began to move to the entrance of the ski slopes... I thought I
            heard
            the unfamiliar sound of horses&#39; hooves, and then I saw Kouenji riding a horse galloping past
            us, kicking
            up snow. The students in the other class looked deeply surprised, and Kitou seemed to pull back
            a
            little.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For students who were not used to Kouenji, this was not an unreasonable
            reaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mr. Customer, that is not the course!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Immediately after that, several staff who were fumbling from a distance screamed
            and
            chased after him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What was that..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Amazing, huh...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In a daze, Nishino and Yamamura stared at Kouenji, who became smaller like a bean
            grain. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I wonder. It&#39;s a sight I&#39;ve never seen before, but I&#39;m not that
            surprised.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida said so in a way that I could only hear her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;As his classmate, I&#39;m used to Kouenji&#39;s unusual behaviour,
            so...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Strangely, I feel that it is not surprising at all for something like this to
            happen
            with Kouenji. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">To be blunt, I&#39;m just used to it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.2grqrue"><span>Part 3</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We split up to get dressed, got ready, and gathered at the rendezvous point.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I, Kushida, Ryuen and Kitou moved to the lift. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We decided to board the two-person lift with a combination of me and Ryuen, and
            then
            Kushida and Kitou. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because we decided that there would be less trouble this way. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just in case, I sent Kushida and Kitou first, and boarded after a few others.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In doing so, I also intended to avoid clashes on the lift. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can&#39;t you get along a little better with Kitou?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s impossible. If Kitou was the one asking, then that would be a
            different story.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Staring at the snowy mountains, Ryuen replied so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s no chance, huh? Well, it&#39;s no use in that case, but this is
            a
            good chance. Kitou seemed to have gained some trust from Sakayanagi as well. I thought you would
            have the
            idea to use this as an opportunity. Depending on the case, you could even make him an
            ally.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen sitting beside me thinks that this school trip is mainly about gathering
            information, but that&#39;s not a mistake. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In fact, it can be seen that Sakayanagi is doing similar things. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kitou doesn&#39;t look completely human, but it seems like he&#39;s very
            loyal,
            at least. Besides, Sakayanagi was on the alert when he formed a group with me. She must have
            been worried
            for what we&#39;d talk about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s quite realistic, huh.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&#39;t have much contact with Kitou, and I still don&#39;t know anything
            about
            him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, despite the attitude of thoroughly disliking Ryuen, there is a strong
            sense
            of willingness to protect Class A together with Sakayanagi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">And I&#39;ve never heard of any problematic behaviour from Kitou alone. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I carelessly tried to negotiate to bring him into my side, he will think that
            I am
            asking him to reveal information.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Besides, the talent I needed from the A-class was just Katsuragi. Both
            Kitou
            and Hashimoto were good soldiers, but not enough to add to my handpieces. It&#39;s out of
            proportion to the
            risk.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seemed like that was the reason why he continued to be hostile without
            friendly
            contact with Kitou. Even after evaluating Kitou, he seemed to recognize Katsuragi in a different
            way. The
            lift arrived, and we landed on the advanced course. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou, who had been waiting for us, called Ryuen to the starting point. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that they won&#39;t do anything lukewarm like slowly enjoying the course
            first... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, give the signal.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen gave Kushida such an instruction and ordered her to &nbsp;start the
            countdown.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Both of you, be careful skiing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida raised her hand and started counting down the start.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They open up a few meters between each other and prepare to slide out. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Who will be the winner?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Start!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The moment Kushida put her hand down, they both got off to a good start almost
            simultaneously.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s go after them, too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Eh, are you sure? I&#39;m not sure I can catch up, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then come slowly after me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying that, Kushida and I also started skiing a few seconds later. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen and Kitou were on the move as they battled their way back and forth.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They&#39;re skiing down at high speed in beautiful arcs to the right and
            left.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My technique, which was still incomplete yesterday, began to be elevated by
            getting a
            role model before my eyes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A long advanced course will allow me to learn deeper and more closely.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apart from that, the battle between Ryuen and Kitou was still the same. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought one of them would surpass the other soon, but it&#39;s pretty
            equal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As far as I can see, there is no big difference in skill, and their desire to win
            is
            the same. Even after the middle of the course, it didn&#39;t look to be settling. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As the race was coming to an end, the distance between the two were gradually
            getting
            closer. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">An unexpected accident?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have a bad feeling about this.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If this situation continued, there was a risk of collision due to overlap in
            their
            positioning in the skiing course. No, this is not an accident or such for both sides. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They should consider this a dangerous sign of the opponent winning by
            tackling.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I copied their movements and learned from their technique as I
            accelerated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Die, Kitou!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Piss off, Ryuen!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After hearing them, suddenly, I forced my body into the slight gap between them.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The two scattered in a panic due to the sudden entrance of a third party. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both sides were staring at me, but I succeeded in forcing them to keep their
            distance.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I finished the advanced course, and Ryuen and Kitou stopped slightly behind
            me.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, and Kitou who was in front of him, quickly turned around and approached me
            walking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Why did you get in the way?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou, in an angry tone of voice, came at me with such force that it seemed as if
            he
            was about to grab me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I decided it was dangerous. Things got too intense and you were trying to
            win
            by doing something improper.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No matter in what form, a match is a match. Ryuen knew that
            too.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if the other person understands or not. I can&#39;t
            call
            that a skiing match.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying his grievances, Kitou glanced at Ryuen and skiied away. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I could feel that they were not going to have one more match.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;At that time, Kushida also skiied down and arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;The three of you were too fast, but Ayanokoji-kun, I didn&#39;t
            expect
            that..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While stepping on the snow, Ryuen approached me with an unhappy face. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t look like a fucking beginner. Were you
            pretending?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Pretend? No, it&#39;s the first time I skied yesterday. &rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But Ryuen didn&#39;t believe me, spitting in the air, he headed for the lift.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For the time being, it&#39;s good to have peace of mind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Probably. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I understand that he&#39;s angry, your skiing was amazing. You were like
            the
            protagonist of a manga that would do everything perfectly with talent, even if you didn&#39;t
            try. Ryuen
            said it too, but is it really the second day since you started?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, I am not the hero of such a manga. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the years I&#39;ve lived, countless experiences have accumulated in my body.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if it is the first time skiing itself, sports in general are shallow and
            broadly
            connected by lines. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I just connected them together, connected the verbal and visual information, and
            tried sliding. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can&#39;t you believe it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s not it. But if I hadn&#39;t seen the move that got Amasawa, I
            might
            not have believed it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At that time, even if for a moment, I showed Kushida the battle between White
            Room
            students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Did that doubt and apprehension make my progress on these skis more truthful?
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Amazing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I am once again praised, but I somehow can&#39;t accept it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That is not true.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This again?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She thinks I am just being humble, but I can&#39;t help that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, Ryuen&#39;s and Kushida&#39;s skiing was that of experts, and was truly
            a
            model for me to follow. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They may not have accumulated a vast amount of experience like I have. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In that sense, they have much more sense than I do.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s go to the lift, too. I&#39;m out of trouble, and I want to enjoy
            skiing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right. It might be a hard time for those who can&#39;t
            ski,
            though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I suppose that is true for any activity. It would be nice if everyone could enjoy
            it
            even if they were bad at it, but that&#39;s not the case.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether it&#39;s video games or sports, it&#39;s often not fun for those who
            aren&#39;t good at them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.vx1227"><span>Part 4</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At noon, everyone from group 6 gathered at the restaurant attached to the ski
            resort.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because it was in food court format, I ordered what I liked and returned to my
            seat.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was handed a one-touch call marked number 3 and told to come get the food I
            ordered
            as soon as it rang when it was ready. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What about you guys, Watanabe-kun?&quot; Did you get better at
            skiing?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida asked about the four who went to the beginners&#39; course, as they had
            been
            on the advanced course all along. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I got pretty good at skiing. Not as good as Nishino or Amikura,
            though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe&#39;s humble yet slightly growing self-confidence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, Yamamura, whose name is not mentioned, has a dark expression
            (as
            always) and lacks spirit. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;As for Yamamura...well, she&#39;s not there just yet.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Talking only to me, he reported that she wasn&#39;t getting any better. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The person in question didn&#39;t look like she wanted to be spoken to, so I
            didn&#39;t say anything. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the one-touch call rang, so I went to get my meal. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took the hot soup curry on a tray to our table. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, the eight of us started our lunch together. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, who had chosen a light hamburger, was the first to finish his meal and
            pushed
            the wrapper and tray to Watanabe. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe, with a bitter laugh, placed the empty tray on top of his own. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Lend me a hand, Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Um...but I&#39;m still eating?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">About a third of the soup curry is left. As time passes, the hotness will be
            ruined.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe took pity on me and sent me off without a word. As for Kitou...he never
            looked at me in the first place. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Come with me for a bit,Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Um...but I&#39;m still eating?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Make it quick.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m gonna step out for a little.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mhm. We&#39;ll be waiting for you while we eat.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I left Kushida here, and I walked through the food court with Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, he finally stopped around the edge of the food court and took out his
            phone.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he unlocked it with his fingertip and stared at the screen for a while.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course. That Sakayanagi, it seems that she&#39;s using her men to gather
            information. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, his classmate came up with a report confirming that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Just like you, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m not asking directly, but I believe that Ryuen is giving the same
            instructions. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess. This school trip is not for friendship. In order to crush the
            head, it
            is important to rip off the limbs first. Sakayanagi seems to know that very well,
            too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both Sakayanagi and Ryuen could not have a class fight as individuals. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">How do you beat your opponent in a class team fight? Upgrading your allies&#39;
            abilities is important, but so is reducing your foe&#39;s fighting strength. Sakayanagi&#39;s
            legs are
            particularly bad, and her usual range of movement is very narrow. It&#39;s mostly Kamuro or
            Hashimoto
            covering for this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If these two were to be seen to have a weakness that would make them succumb to
            Ryuen, Sakayanagi would lose a valuable leg. Her ability to gather information will be reduced
            at once.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Shall I ask you why you bothered to call me? You&#39;re not here to report
            a
            scouting battle, are you?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;From here, I will instruct the guys in the class and start preparing for
            total
            resistance against Sakayanagi. Whether the final test is a written test, or whatever else, I
            will crush her
            by any means necessary.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I heard something similar on the bus. That the battle has already
            begun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah. But before I get started, there is something I need to double check
            with
            you. &quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Ryuen said so, my phone vibrated once. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I told him to wait and checked the screen, I saw a short message from
            Kushida.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura-san is on her way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Is she wondering how I&#39;m doing after being called out by Ryuen? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura is most likely moving under directions from Sakayanagi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is now possible that Yamamura is eavesdropping nearby, but I can&#39;t tell
            Ryuen.
            This is also a part of the battle between Sakayanagi and Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I did anything, it would be against Sakayanagi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, it seemed that someone else had contacted Ryuen and he was
            staring
            at the screen again. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen put his phone into his pocket without changing his expression and began to
            talk. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You remember the 800,000,000 points I told you about a year ago,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s feasible.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right. After this, I&#39;m sure the class will react in the same way
            too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you going to tell them?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki should be the only one in the Ryuen class who knows about the strategy to
            accumulate 800,000,000 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even Ibuki probably only learned of it by coincidence and didn&#39;t know the
            specifics. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It would take a shit load of money. That&#39;s not the kind of money I can
            get
            when I keep it a secret, is it? There&#39;s only a year left, and it&#39;s almost a little too
            late to make
            a move.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Certainly, the cooperation of your classmates is essential if you are serious
            about
            improving the accuracy of your strategy. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just as Ichinose gradually pooled the private points of everyone with trust,
            Ryuen
            was also aiming for the target amount together with his classmates.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you want to confirm that I will cooperate for the 800,000,000
            points?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve been very considerate to your class until now, you know? The
            sports
            festival, the culture festival. &nbsp;And then, at the end of the term test, I helped your plan
            to fight
            with Sakayanagi. You have no complaints, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, since that time last year when we discussed with Ryuen, the Horikita
            class
            has been able to move so freely that we almost forgot about Ryuen&#39;s presence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If Ryuen had remained as militant as he was in year one, things wouldn&#39;t have
            gone so smoothly until now. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You seem to get along great with Kushida too. Even though you were working
            so
            hard to expel her.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry. Sometimes, we have to change our policy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps amused by the words, or caught by them, Ryuen laughed and clapped his
            hands
            many times. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I can easily crush Kushida if I feel like it. You know that,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen is one of the few students outside the class to know the true nature of
            Kushida.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The fact that he could have challenged her any time but did not choose to do so,
            must
            also be the result of the promise. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So you want me to keep my promise?&quot; You&#39;re even threatening me for
            it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not forcing you or anything. Will you do it? Or not?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a verbal promise at the time, but Ryuen had said he would show no mercy if
            I
            went against it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Before I reply, let me ask you, what happens after you defeat
            Sakayanagi?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;After we defeat Class A at the end of the school year, it will certainly be
            a
            one-on-one battle between my class and your class, right? In my mind, it&#39;s all part of the
            story of me
            defeating you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That is what he thinks after all. Looking at things thus far, there is no
            doubt.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s a little too convenient. At that time, you got off the stage
            once.
            And you should have only been laying the groundwork for Kaneda and Hiyori. But now, you&#39;re
            back on the
            stage. If &nbsp;you want me to make good on my promise, you should back off. If I am in Class A
            and you are
            in Class B, it is inevitable that you will give up the win, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Only then can we create a situation where we can talk about my cooperation for
            the
            800,000,000 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course. If Horikita and you, and both the classes really clash with each
            other, and you win and move up to A class, only my side will be the fools. Or, if the
            800,000,000 points
            plan works well, can you promise that you&#39;ll take the students from the Horikita class into
            A
            Class?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The smile disappeared from Ryuen&#39;s face, and his sharp sideways glance turned
            to
            me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s impossible. The extra private points are of course
            ours.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s money that lives on after graduation, and no one is going to spend it to
            save unrelated students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you lose, we save you, and if you win, you will abandon us, huh..?
            It&#39;s
            completely unthinkable. Therefore, I cannot cooperate with the plan to save 800,000,000 points.
            But from now
            on, no matter what class you attack, you&#39;re free; I have no right to stop you.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess you aren&#39;t such a naive bastard after all,
            Ayanokoji.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This isn&#39;t only about me, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess it can&#39;t be helped, then. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t stand up
            for
            what you said.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He backed downed easier than I expected. It seemed like he knew he was going to
            be
            turned down. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you still intend to accumulate 800,000,000 points, even after the
            negotiation breaks down?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not going to change my strategy now. The main objective is to
            accumulate 800,000,000. Moreover, I&#39;ll beat both Sakayanagi and you. If I become an A Class
            without
            spending money, I can graduate with a lot of money. Right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although it was already a dream, the plan has been replaced by complete
            imagination.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, from here, Ryuen said that he would accumulate 800,000,000 points.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So far, I&#39;ve used money pulling in Katsuragi and employing the guys
            from
            year one, but it&#39;s time to begin my turn to collect. I will switch to a completely private
            points
            doctrine.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If he is that frantic to collect private points, then there will be risks
            involved.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen&#39;s odd thoughts and attitude here left a strange influence on my
            thoughts.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t look at me like it&#39;s too strange for me to press for my plan
            without making any concessions.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m right, though. I can&#39;t see the essence of this
            conversation.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s simple. It means that I already knew you&#39;d break the contract.
            I
            can&#39;t crush you if I&#39;m halfway connected to you. But, it&#39;s a different matter if you
            break your
            promise like this. Because now, we can fight properly.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, he is choosing a revived obsession with victory over an alignment
            of
            interests. A similar thing was said on the bus, but the war was declared again. Still, I
            wasn&#39;t
            completely convinced. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is some intention in the flow of this talk. But I won&#39;t get an answer
            if I
            pursue it here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s okay to look ahead, but you should only think about our rematch
            after
            you beat Sakayanagi.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hah. I know that woman&#39;s got a sharp head. But, that&#39;s all there is
            to
            it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying so, he is showing that he is absolutely confident for the end of year
            test.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, you were defeated, but were able to come back. I will admit that your
            talent
            exceeded even my expectations. You certainly are continuing on the road to success.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether or not it can cross the barrier at the end,is a different matter. I
            wonder if
            this gap, not recognizing obstacles as obstacles, might eventually resonate in the arena of
            battle. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, depending also on how Sakayanagi perceives Ryuen, the signs and hints
            will
            change. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Go back first, Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, Ryuen walked towards the toilet. From a seat somewhat far away,
            Hiyori, who was looking at us, noticed me and waved her hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems Hiyori&#39;s group came to ski too.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I lightly raised my hand at Hiyori and replied, and returned to the group table.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura has already returned and is silently touching her phone with an angry
            face.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Where&#39;s Ryuen?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think he&#39;ll come back after going to the toilet.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Are you okay? He didn&#39;t hit you or anything, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe looked worried and checked the details of my body.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t worry. We just chatted a little.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I hope so, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura, who had been slowly eating here finished her meal, and Nishino followed
            along with her, taking her tray. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;l... go put my tray away.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The two of them came from the same stall, so they seemed to be going back
            together.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ayanokoji, if he has you by the short hairs, don&#39;t hesitate to talk to
            me.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou muttered so with a deep look in his eyes, perhaps thinking that
            Watanabe&#39;s
            way of asking was too naive. I wish he had said these words before I was called.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When Ryuen returned before long, Kitou took his gaze off of me. </span></p>

            bastards and the A Class down too. I&#39;ll show you that, after all, Sakayanagi is just a
            passing point for
            me, and nothing else.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can&#39;t defeat the A Class, you bastard.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen looked calm, or rather he was putting on a performance to look that way. He
            may
            be saying that he really believes he can win, but in truth there is nothing to back that up.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, he might have information that I don&#39;t know, but, simply comparing
            abilities, Sakayanagi is superior. </span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After being called a dog, Kitou stood up with his large hands on the table.

            happen.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can&#39;t give him that advice in time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seeing the vain movement of his opponent, Ryuen grabbed the man&#39;s shoulders
            and
            slammed an intense knee kick into his abdomen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some students from the other school are on the ground, fainted from fear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Looks like some interesting events happen even in a boring school trip like
            this.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen began to find joy in the situation that was meant to occur. To think that
            my
            first contact event in my life with another school, would turn out to be a disturbingly violent
            affair...</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">One of the men swung with a left and right punch with a strong grip. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was no intention of a one on one fight, and the other side seemed to be
            trying
            to win with numbers. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, Kitou showed himself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The other men were flustered by his expression and sense of intimidation, which
            were
            clearly not that of a high school student. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He&#39;s... he&#39;s going to help us, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While grabbing Yamamura&#39;s shoulders and protecting her, Nishino walked over
            and
            muttered so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura is Kitou&#39;s classmate. When he noticed her in a pinch, it&#39;s
            only natural he won&#39;t just ignore her.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Fortunately, they seemed to understand that it wasn&#39;t a good idea to keep
            fighting in the food court, so Ryuen and the others all walked outdoors.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we call an adult?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No one can stop them now. So, it&#39;s better to avoid strangers&#39; eyes
            and
            just engage with each other.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We were outnumbered, but the guys from the other side didn&#39;t look like much.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If Ryuen and Kitou team up, it shouldn&#39;t take long to finish them off.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It took about 10 minutes for Ryuen and Kitou to return. While pulling the guys
            they
            beat up behind them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then Ryuen and Kitou made them sit down before Yamamura and Nishino, and made
            them
            beg for forgiveness. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that Ryuen and Kitou thoroughly inflicted pain until their rebellious
            hearts
            broke... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is a problem when seen in this way, but it may also be necessary for
            Yamamura
            and Nishino. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The men promised not to show themselves before the two again, and were set
            free.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This group&#39;s definitely not boring, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I could only agree after hearing Kushida&#39;s words.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12 c20" id="h.3fwokq0"><span class="c26"></span></h3>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.2u6wntf"><span>Part 5</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Skiing as time permitted, we returned to the ryokan before 19:00. I still want to
            ski
            some more, but I think this should be just enough. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The second day is coming to an end, and the night is gradually passing by.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was invited by Sudou at dinner, so we went to the public bath together. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After washing my body, I gave myself up to the hot spring. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kaah! So good!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou, who has been sweating every day in the basketball court, might be able to
            get
            some benefits from this. I repeatedly rinsed my face with hot water with both hands, and it blew
            away my
            fatigue.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;Yo.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After a while, Hashimoto of Class A entered the bath next to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I raised my hand and replied, Sudou also followed along and raised his hand.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wow... I&#39;m so tired today.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a very tired look, he stretched his shoulders and sighed deeply.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Did something happen?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whether something happens or not, I&#39;m always worried about the problem
            children in my group.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Inwardly, I have always been curious about Hashimoto&#39;s group. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s because of Kouenji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. You&#39;re supposed to be together with everyone during
            free
            conduct, right? Normally, if he had any sense, we&#39;d be discussing things together, but
            I&#39;m being
            made to go with him wherever he wants to go.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is obvious that Kouenji is not normally the type to obey, but it seems that it
            is
            still the same even in the environment of the group including all classes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like you were at a ranch where you could experience horseback
            riding
            today, but was it Kouenji&#39;s wish?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Why do you..? Well, it&#39;s no wonder you saw that commotion.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hashimoto, holding his head, dunked the lower half of his face into the
            bath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I just saw him rush through, but did Kouenji come back properly after
            that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He submerged for about ten seconds, then Hashimoto shrugged his shoulders and
            surfaced. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;After about an hour. &nbsp;We just had to wait in vain, because we
            didn&#39;t
            have the mental leeway to experience horseback riding.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, we talked about what they did for their free conduct.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if this hell had continued since the start, Sudou put his hands together and
            muttered with sorrow. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So, I had planned to have lunch at a famous place I saw on television, but
            that
            Kouenji guy had the nerve to say he wanted to go skiing. He went straight to the ski slopes
            before we could
            argue. After that, I couldn&#39;t enjoy myself any more. This is the end of our second
            day.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If he ignored Kouenji and went to that famous restaurant or whatever, then it
            would
            be a violation of the group&#39;s rules. What a sad, sad story. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re his classmate, so I was wondering if you knew of a way to deal
            with
            him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The school trip is just over the tipping point, with only two days remaining. At
            the
            very least, the group will want to make their own choice for the fourth day of free conduct.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He&#39;s out of hand, man. We can&#39;t do anything about him, can
            we?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou honestly spoke his thoughts. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He seems cold, but after a long time together, he&#39;s simply already given up.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How about you, Ayanokoji?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not realistic to convince Kouenji. Honestly, there&#39;s nothing I
            can
            do about it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...it&#39;s a cruel reality.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, there may be one way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What is it? Tell me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Glad to have any little hope, Hashimoto wants to know how to free himself from
            the
            current situation. There is one way to guarantee free conduct, if he is willing to tolerate the
            demerits.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I finished telling him about it, Hashimoto nodded with conviction. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, I guess that&#39;s the only thing left to do.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You should discuss what to do with the group.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I will, I&#39;m seriously considering it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As he thought about it, Hashimoto disappeared into the bath again.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12 c20" id="h.19c6y18"><span class="c26"></span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.3l18frh"><span>Part 6</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After enjoying the large bath for about an hour and putting on yukatas, Sudou and
            I
            each took a bottle of free mineral water from the refrigerated case in the changing room and
            poured it down
            our throats with our hands on our hips.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The cool water is sending shivers through my warmed up body. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright, I&#39;m ready to do this, Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s about time, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because of the long bath, his face is a bit red. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Or maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s nervous, imagining what&#39;s coming.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s time to formally tell Horikita how he feels. Sudou drank up about half
            of
            the remaining water all at once.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Puh! Time to go, then!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if going to a basketball match after this, he slapped his cheeks and fired
            himself
            up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So? What exactly are you going to do?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The time is just past 9:30 pm. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t think she&#39;s sleeping yet, but I&#39;m sure many students are
            currently spending time in their rooms with their friends.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t see her having fun or making noise, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised
            if
            Horikita is keeping a warm eye on the others. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In the meantime, that&#39;s right... I&#39;ll call her on my
            phone.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Holding his cell phone, he walked through the curtain, and exited the men&#39;s
            bath... then, he immediately started the phone call.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;...oh, right, it&#39;s me. Where are you now?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The call was quickly answered, so he hurriedly asked so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In the lobby? Okay, just wait there for a second. Um, I&#39;ll be right
            there,
            so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou, who hung up the call, had roughly breathed and looked at me as he walked
            out.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s a corner in the lobby of the ryokan selling small souvenirs,
            right?
            She seems to be there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t confess right away, okay? There will be a lot of eyes in the
            lobby.
            Horikita will be troubled, too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I-I know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Confession is a major event that must take into account not only the confessing
            side,
            but also the side being confessed to.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But where should I confess..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The corridor leading to the backyard, no one&#39;s coming there at this
            hour,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is a little wooden deck where you can enjoy the view from the backyard up
            the
            stairs leading to the elevated terrace. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, we can&#39;t &nbsp;go out to the backyard after 9pm, so it shouldn&#39;t
            be
            crowded any more. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thanks, Ayanokoji, you&#39;re a good friend to have.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He gave me a thumbs up, saying &quot;nice&quot;, and laughed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a very nervous smile, though. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When Sudou arrived at the lobby in a restless manner, it seemed that Horikita had
            stopped to see the souvenirs and waited nearby. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, I stopped at a blind spot at a distance. In the lobby, one employee
            and
            several students seem to be looking at souvenirs and sitting in a chair and laughing, and it is
            again clear
            that it is not a suitable place for confessions. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Somehow, after making a few gestures, Sudou seemed to have succeeded in summoning
            her
            to the corridor leading to the backyard, and the two of them headed there side by side. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Normally, it would be best to stop going after them here, but it would be
            annoying if
            Sudou got mad at me. Making my footsteps as quiet as possible, I followed them in order to see
            his
            &quot;impressive appearance&quot;.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span>[TL Note 24 : I put &quot;impressive appearance&quot; in quotes because it&#39;s a very
            exaggerated expression so I think he </span><span class="c50">might</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;say it
            sarcastically, which the quotes will imply it to be.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Shortly thereafter, the signs of other people disappeared as expected, and they
            stopped in the middle of the empty hallway. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita looked back, wondering. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I wonder if she bathed in the same way as we were just a while ago. Her hair
            glowed
            glossy enough to be seen in the dim lighting. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s okay here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou, whose imposing demeanor is his main selling point, is perhaps too nervous
            to
            speak loudly in front of the girl he likes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At night, ryokan only have modest and gentle BGM and quiet talking voices, so he
            wants to avoid unexpected loud noises, even if there is no one around.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s just about right. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I am... I...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita leaned with curiosity at Sudou&#39;s hesitant attitude. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t see any particularly irritating or hasty attitudes at the moment.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps, this is also an indication of the relationship of trust that Horikita
            and
            Sudou have built up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we first met, Horikita would have rushed him to tell him what&#39;s on his
            mind.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, my phone vibrated. Even though it&#39;s in silent mode, it may still be
            heard
            in this silence.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 25 : &#12510;&#12490;&#12540;&#12514;&#12540;&#12489;, literally
            &quot;Manner Mode&quot;, means silent mode.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Therefore, I immediately powered it off without even looking at the screen.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It doesn&#39;t seem like I was noticed. I&#39;m safe, for now. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, Suzune. Am I...unusual?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought he was going to make the confession right away, but Sudou asked that,
            as if
            trying to squeeze it out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I wonder how different I am from when I met you...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you still worried about the people around?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There is that, too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He&#39;s talking while trying to build up the courage to confess to her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the same time, Sudou himself seems to have been aware of this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right. Looking at it objectively, you&#39;ve changed more than any one. Not
            in
            a bad way, but in a good way. I&#39;ve been watching from the side for a long time, so I can be
            the one to
            guarantee that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Those are Horikita&#39;s true feelings. No, not just Horikita&#39;s; I&#39;m sure
            most people living in the school hold the same opinion. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I, I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, don&#39;t be too proud. If I am to speak without hesitation, compared
            to
            your surroundings, you started out as a minus in the first place. Just because you gained a plus
            after that,
            don&#39;t think that you&#39;ve become a better person than other people.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">One&#39;s surroundings are misled and give high praise after the recoil from
            being a
            minus.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, as Horikita said, the accumulated negative is not gone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right. No, you&#39;re definitely right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou was in low spirits after the harsh words, but he accepted them and firmly
            nodded. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s so embarrassing. All the stupid things that I&#39;ve
            done.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Lateness, absences, written test results that were at the bottom of the class,
            verbal
            abuse and careless violence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter how many times he looks back, the past will not change, and he will
            always
            be ashamed of the path he has taken. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You seem to have a very humble heart, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nodding, Horikita gently narrowed her eyes and smiled. I don&#39;t think she
            realizes
            this herself, but Horikita has also changed a lot. The magnitude of this change is not as great
            as
            Sudou&#39;s, of course. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t hurt or embarrass others for no reason any more. It&#39;s
            okay.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, Horikita interpreted this as Sudou being unsure about his own growth
            and
            past, and asking her for advice. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I guess this was passed on to Sudou, who shook his head in a hurry. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, that ain&#39;t it, Suzune.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I...I...umm...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if recalling what he had declared to me, Sudou put out his right hand. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But the words didn&#39;t follow the motion, and only the stretched out hand kept
            in
            front of her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What? What&#39;s going o-&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita, who couldn&#39;t understand, tried to question the meaning of his right
            hand. Then... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I like you! Please date me!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was able to free himself from the embarrassment of suppressing his words, and
            was
            able to clearly say so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was too loud, but... all he can do now is to ignore that. In case anyone heard
            him, I can just stay here and protect him.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita, who did not think even a little bit that she would be confessed to, is
            frozen in bewilderment. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re going to date me, I want you to hold my right hand
            back!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait a bit... are, are you serious..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was Horikita who was about to ask back, but she quickly retracted her
            words.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;This is some kind of joke, right?&rsquo; She knew it was rude to say such
            a
            thing, as she could tell that Sudou&#39;s passion, motivation, and feelings were true. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita closed her lips while staring at Sudou&#39;s right hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I expected an immediate response, but Horikita looked at his right hand and fell
            silent. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that confession, the longer the silence continues, the more Sudou&#39;s
            heart
            rate will rise. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure it will be a painful time, not a pleasant one. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, Horikita also deserves to be given some time to think. A confession does not
            consist of only one side&#39;s thoughts. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Um...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Eventually, things were sorted out in Horikita&#39;s mind, and she spoke slowly
            as if
            she had chosen a word to say. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;ve never thought I&#39;d get a confession from
            someone.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Receiving Sudou&#39;s passionate feelings, how will Horikita respond? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Will she accept, or refuse? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Or will she defer it for later? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As the silence dragged on, Sudou&#39;s right arm began to tremble little by
            little.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not because of his arm getting numb, but because of nerves and fear. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The frustration of not getting a response, whether it will be accepted or not.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Still believing that the hand he offered would be gripped back, Sudou kept his
            head
            down. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sudou-kun. Thank you for liking someone like me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She expressed her gratitude. However, Horikita did not show a movement of
            gripping
            his right hand back. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, I&#39;m sorry. I... I cannot answer your feelings.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That was the conclusion that Horikita came up with. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, I see... if it&#39;s okay... could you tell me the reason?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not able to raise his face, Sudou said so while keeping his right hand stiff.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The reason... yes. It&#39;s not that I am dissatisfied with you or
            anything-&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She started speaking, then stopped. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;To be honest, I&#39;ve never been in love with anyone before. I still
            don&#39;t
            have that feeling, and I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like. If I go out with you, after you told
            me that you
            like me, it&#39;s possible that I will like you with time, that&#39;s what I thought. But... I
            think I&#39;m
            waiting for the moment when I might fall in love with someone out of instinct, without planning
            for
            it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if confirming her own feelings, Horikita said so to Sudou. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That is the reason for the refusal. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She wishes to keep waiting for her first love. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a hidden sentiment that no one else has to hear about.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see... thanks. Thanks for telling me that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps because he was so firmly informed, Sudou did not persist. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Your courage and feelings. You&#39;ve firmly conveyed them.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying so, Horikita hurriedly grabbed his right hand, which was almost losing its
            strength. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have truly received your feelings. Thank you for liking someone like
            me.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou&#39;s trembling right hand tells the whole story. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Thinking that it was about time, I decided to turn back. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to wait for them to come back after calming down, I&#39;ll look around
            in
            the souvenir corner.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Various Hokkaido souvenirs are displayed in the souvenir corner, which I
            hadn&#39;t
            stopped by yet. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Speaking of which, Nanase said something about chocolate-coated potatoes,
            huh...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I tried to find out what it was, but it seems that they are not sold at a ryokan
            so I
            could not find it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I&#39;ll have to look for it either during the sightseeing tour tomorrow, or
            during our free time on the last day. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I should check my phone to find a store that sells them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oops...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I turned on my cell phone with that in mind, there were a large number of
            messages and past calls. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From Kei, of course. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Where are you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I couldn&#39;t see you at all today.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you busy with something?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I miss you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I miss you!!!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">...and so on. When I opened the app, all the messages were marked as read in a
            few
            seconds. Right after, my phone rang.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Uuuh!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would be appropriate to describe the sound as a cat&#39;s growl. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you angry?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not angry, but, you know..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see, it is at least clear that she is extremely angry. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Why can&#39;t you just be with me for a little while!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry. We&#39;re on a school trip, so there&#39;s a lot I have to
            do.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That may be true too, but..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I received information from Kushida about group 1, so I already know that
            you&#39;ve been conducting yourself skilfully. That&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t worried about
            you.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmmm? You&#39;re having a lot of fun with Kushida-san, huh!? She is cute,
            after
            all! Cheater!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re in the same group, it can&#39;t be helped. Besides, you already
            know
            what kind of person Kushida is, don&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That has nothing to do with it. Her breasts are big too... you&#39;re...
            aah!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I get it, I get it. I have the time now, so let&#39;s meet
            somewhere.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Really? Let&#39;s hang out, then!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After the calculated act, she suddenly replied with a cheerful voice. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe that&#39;s not a good idea. Ryuen is in my room too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah... right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Where are you now?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m in the room, but I think the other 3 girls are still in the bath. I
            was
            with them until just now. But I came back first because I wanted to contact you.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kei was always deeply concerned about the wounds on her body, but it looks like
            she&#39;s completely past it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have the key to the room, so I&#39;ll go back to the room first. I&#39;ll
            call you after, so please wait.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yep!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ve been waiting for Sudou at the souvenir corner for a little less than 5
            minutes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since there was no sign of his return, I got curious and decided to check the
            corridor leading to the backyard. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, I saw Sudou standing alone in the same position as when he
            confessed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I can&#39;t see Horikita, so she must have already left. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sudou?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I felt bad since Kei was waiting for me, but I approached and called out to him.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, damn it!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As far as I could tell, he looked frustrated.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I knew it wouldn&#39;t work..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was regret in Sudou&#39;s face as he looked back at me, but he also had a
            bright appearance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry. I couldn&#39;t forget how Suzune&#39;s hand felt, so I&#39;ve been
            standing here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Did you watch? It was quite the failure.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even so, it was an honorable defeat.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was shown a brave, manly confession.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I had no intention of giving up even if she refused my confession. I
            thought
            that next year, I will show how I&#39;ve become even bigger, and confess again. But that&#39;s
            no good. At
            the very least, I now know that I cannot reach her.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou seemed to sense something that I could not when watching from a distance.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not about giving up or not giving up. I still like her, but I feel
            like she&#39;s a lovely flower that I cannot reach.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He couldn&#39;t seem to put it together well, but he said so and laughed a
            little.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What about Onodera?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How would I know? Even you don&#39;t know how she really feels,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, it&#39;ll turn out the way it should. Onodera is a good person, and
            our
            hobbies are the same. Now that my wicked thoughts about Suzune have disappeared, I feel like I
            can be with
            Onodera more fairly.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether or not it develops into love is a secondary matter. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m telling you, I&#39;m going to keep working really hard from now on
            too.
            It was for someone else until now, but from today on, I&#39;ll go all out for myself. My
            immediate objective
            is to surpass Hirata.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s quite the declaration, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If he crosses that wall, he will finally be dealing with only the top tier of the
            school year, such as Horikita and Keisei. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that without being shaken or depressed, he can look to a higher
            goal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.4k668n3"><span>Part 8</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I came back to the guest room by walking quickly, Horikita was standing in
            front
            of the room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I was waiting for you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had a bad feeling about this, so I played dumb, but Horikita had a stiff
            expression. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re very mean, Ayanokoji-kun. You were watching, right?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You were at the souvenir corner earlier, right? Normally, I&#39;d think you
            were just nearby by accident, but in your case, I wouldn&#39;t think of it as a
            coincidence.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">What a high-handed way of thinking. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She is right, but still. If I have to take similar measures against Horikita in
            the
            future, I have to make sure that I am not discovered. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I know, you&#39;re thinking that you should make sure you&#39;re not seen
            next
            time, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;... Impressive.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I earnestly clapped, and praised her perceptive insight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sudou asked me to do it. He said he wanted me to see him
            confess.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even so, don&#39;t you think it lacks consideration for the female side,
            me?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sudou-kun still has a long way to go, I see. I&#39;ll take points off for
            him
            asking you to watch over him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She was taken by surprise, but did not seem that angry. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So? Did you come all the way here to complain to me, a
            spectator?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She&#39;s speaking plainly without hesitation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, that&#39;s a joke. There&#39;s actually something I want to talk
            about.
            But you really look like you want to enter your room.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s not really true, but... If possible, can we do this
            tomorrow?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span>&quot;I&#39;m being pressed by </span><span class="c51">someone else</span><span class="c1">.
            She&#39;s upset because I haven&#39;t been with her at all for these two days.&quot;</span></p>
