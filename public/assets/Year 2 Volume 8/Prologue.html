        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">A wise man keeps away from danger.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Ever since I was little, I&rsquo;ve always kept my distance from people.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Why did I make such a choice?</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It was easier that way, and, most importantly, it stopped me from getting wrapped
                        up
                        in trouble.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">No making friends, no making enemies.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It was simpler to maintain neutral relationships.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, one day, I was wrapped up in a non-sensical fight between some
                        children.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The only reason being that I was close by.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Three out of the four people there excluding me were relentlessly attacking one
                        person.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The three&rsquo;s attitude in particular was arrogant, but they weren&rsquo;t
                        that
                        unreasonable, and it had all started with a lie.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The child that was being attacked was clearly upset towards the three, and had
                        lied
                        to them.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It should really have been a trivial thing.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I think it was about whether he received a sign from a famous person or
                        not.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It was the three&rsquo;s wish that he admit his lie and apologize to
                        everyone.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">On one side, a lone person insisting that he isn&rsquo;t lying and refusing to
                        apologize.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I coincidentally encountered them on the spot and analysed the situation as an
                        observer, and encouraged the lying kid to admit that he was lying, but in the end, he wanted to
                        keep the lie
                        up.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">A flimsy lie. He was pointlessly stubborn.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I thought that things might escalate and he might be harmed, but I didn&rsquo;t
                        do
                        anything.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s his fault for telling a useless lie in the first place.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I don&rsquo;t know if he wanted to show off or what, but it really was
                        foolish.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s no need to save him or anything.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It has nothing to do with me.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I sincerely thought so.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">No, I actually even thought that he should get hit once and learn his
                        lesson.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However&hellip; Things ended without getting too serious for the kid.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">A third party suddenly appeared in this predicament and used his quick wits to
                        save
                        the kid.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Just because they were friends, he protected him without blaming him for the
                        lie.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I didn&rsquo;t get it. That&rsquo;s not justice.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The three who had not lied should have been in the right.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">My uncertain heart wasn&rsquo;t clear.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Who&rsquo;s in the right?</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The three who had not lied but had used violence, or the one who stuck to his
                        lie?</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Was it the third party who protected his friend while knowing that it was a
                        lie?</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There was one adult who watched the trouble unfold from the start until the
                        end.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">That person put his hand on my head, and said :</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have the strength to save him, you can just ignore him
                        running away. Having the strength and not using it, now that&rsquo;s something a fool would
                        do.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I didn&rsquo;t understand it back then.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I thought that he was telling me to save that liar.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, as I started growing into an adult, I understood.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The word &ldquo;save&rdquo;, there was no reason that it had to be about the kid
                        who
                        had lied.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I think he meant that if you have the strength to dominate the scene, I could
                        have
                        brought the situation to a finish, no matter what point of view I stood on.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It was the moment that something in me came alive, something I didn&rsquo;t know
                        I
                        had; something passionate, intense.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I still can&rsquo;t forget the words of that person whom I had met for the first
                        time.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After I enrolled in the Advanced Nurturing High School, I reluctantly chose to
                        socialize with people.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If there was someone in trouble, I remembered to help them, even if only a

        <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I wanted to keep being supported by Ichinose&rsquo;s side, who had been confirmed

        <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
