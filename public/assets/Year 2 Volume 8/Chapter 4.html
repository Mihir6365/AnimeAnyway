    <h2 class="c14 c12" id="h.1egqt2p"><span>School Trip, Day </span><span class="c10">3</span></h2>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c35"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.3ygebqi"><span class="c26">Intro</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">About 30 minutes after the bus left the ryokan at 9 am in the morning. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The bus stopped near Sapporo Station and arrived at the destination that will be
            the
            starting point today. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is also a clock tower in Sapporo City, which is a famous spot for
            sightseeing.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We are moving as groups today too, but there is one different point compared to
            yesterday. A little test imposed by the school. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We will visit a total of 6 spots from 15 pre-determined destinations in any
            combination within a time limit (until 5 p.m.). </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A group is considered to have toured one location when they reach the designated
            photo location for each spot and take a commemorative photo with the entire group. We will
            simply repeat
            this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The system is designed so that groups that intentionally break up their members
            to
            collect points in an underhanded manner, or groups with students who fail to act in solidarity
            and act
            selfishly, cannot succeed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The only condition for disqualification is failure to complete six or more spots
            within the time limit.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In that case, the free conduct on the fourth day of the school trip will be taken
            away, and a study session will be held in the ryokan until 4 pm. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Each spot also has its own set score, and any group that can obtain a total of 20
            points or more at six spots will be rewarded with 30,000 private points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, since the size of the score does not affect disqualification, it is up
            to
            each group to judge whether or not they should aim for the reward.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Also, if the photo is not clear and the person cannot be identified, etc., it
            will
            not be counted. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Aside from the question of whether to aim for a reward, if they want to enjoy
            tomorrow&#39;s free conduct, students need to go around the spots earnestly and cooperatively.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In addition, although there is no limit on the number of times public
            transportation
            can be used, it is prohibited to travel by taxi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s also necessary to keep a record of how you got around the spots.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure students would have preferred to move freely on this third day too,
            but,
            for me, it is not a bad idea to walk around Hokkaido based on the conditions given by the school
            in this way
            either.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If we&#39;re only given free movement, we&#39;ll end our school trip with a
            limited
            tour of sightseeing spots and skiing. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I am genuinely looking forward to seeing around Hokkadio, even if I am being
            compelled to do so.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We were given a brochure when we got off the bus. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that the school&#39;s own brochure describes the places to visit around
            here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Sapporo City Clock Tower, the Sapporo TV Tower, and the Hokkaido Museum of
            Modern
            Art are all 1 point. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nakajima Park and the Hokkaido Imperial Shrine are 2 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sapporo Maruyama Zoo, the Hokkaido Museum, and the Sapporo Central Wholesale
            Market
            Outside Market are 3 points.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Moerenuma Park and Shiroikoibito Park are 4 points.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[TL Note 27 : Shiroikoibito Park - White Lovers Park]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Moiwa Mountain is 5 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sunpiazza Aquarium is 6 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jouzankei Hot Springs is 7 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, Lake Shikotsu and Lake Utonai are 8 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s important to note that we&#39;re not finished when we get to the spot.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the Maruyama Zoo in Sapporo City, a photograph with a polar bear or in the
            polar
            bear hall in the back is a prerequisite for completing a spotting tour. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This is kind of surprising. I would expect it from this school,
            but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida, who got off the bus, spoke out. For some reason, she was looking
            elsewhere.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m over here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I had no idea~&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It can&#39;t be, but no, she isn&#39;t even looking over here while saying that.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps she was keenly aware of how strange this was, and she turned her head
            around
            and smiled. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It would really hurt to lose a whole day to a study session if we don&#39;t
            do
            this well. &nbsp;I guess the reason they let us have a whole day of free time yesterday without
            any
            restrictions had something to do with this spotting tour.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That may be the case.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now, the question is, what choice will our group 6 make?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The spot visit had been explained to us before the school trip, but we had just
            been
            told on the bus that it was a bit like a test, with free conduct at stake and private point
            rewards. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, the group&#39;s policy has not been determined at this
            time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Groups moving towards a private point reward may not be able to meet the time
            limit,
            and risks are inevitable. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While some groups seemed to stay on the spot and have discussions, most walked in
            the
            same direction. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like there are many groups headed to the Sapporo City Clock Tower
            after all, since it&#39;s just a stone&#39;s throw away from here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is also a strategy to aim for high-scoring lakes such as Shikotsu and
            Utonai,
            but the risk is high. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It would be more efficient to have a discussion while walking.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Kushida says, the first safe route would be to go from Sapporo Station to the
            clock tower, take pictures at the designated spot, and then head to the TV Tower after going to
            Oodoori
            Park. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In a short amount of time and with little money, we can tour two spots. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, it is unclear at the moment whether it is ideal in the process of aiming
            for
            more than 20 points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, all 8 members of our group 6 got off the bus. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just did a quick search on the map app, and even if we could use a taxi,
            it
            would take us a few hours to get around the 6 high-scoring locations.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The calculations made by Amikura must not have taken into account the time it
            takes
            to get to the location of the shooting. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if we make full use of public transportation, it is unlikely that we will
            &nbsp;be able to score high within time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is anyone here familiar with Hokkaido?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe asked the members of group 6, but there was no good response. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Like the other students, I have no knowledge of how to get around in Hokkaido or
            the
            most efficient means of getting around, so we have to do some research to figure out where to go
            and how to
            get around efficiently. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm~. Even if I want to make a route with the map app, I don&#39;t know
            what&#39;s where so the order gets all messed up.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seemed that Amikura was fighting with the map app to get the right
            destination.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since the spots are scattered east, west, south, north, &nbsp;from the current
            location, one would have to start by understanding their current location.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Moreover, there is no guarantee that public transportation will be available in
            the
            spots, and the list in the brochure does not necessarily indicate that the school has prepared
            reasonable
            spots. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even if we can receive private points, it&#39;s 30,000. Why don&#39;t we
            forget
            about the rewards and have some fun exploring around?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe&#39;s suggestion is one of the right answers. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If we only focus on scoring 20 points within the time limit, our fun will be
            diminished. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We won&#39;t have time to relax and enjoy the local scenery.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So, I think we shouldn&#39;t force ourselves too much.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Me too, I think we should just go wherever we want. I want to go to the
            zoo.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Students who usually live in school don&#39;t have the opportunity to go to a zoo
            or
            an aquarium. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is only natural that they do not want to waste this opportunity. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s listen to everyone&#39;s wishes first, and build up from
            there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amikura proposed that we ignore the scores, and first ask everyone where they
            want to
            go. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, six of us, including me, agreed to ignore the scores and leisurely visit
            the
            minimum number of spots. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, this needs to be discussed and decided by the whole group. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen and Kitou still had not agreed or told us their opinions. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kitou?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe asked Kitou, who had remained silent until now. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No disagreements here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because he responded favourably, Watanabe and the others were relieved for the
            time
            being. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s seven people. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, the last one, didn&#39;t reply. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah...well...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe hesitated to ask, so I decided to ask and confirm the answer. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Everyone has agreed. Can I count your silence as consent?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But it was Ryuen who had declared that he would accumulate 800,000,000 points.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can see the answer myself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m going for the scores.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He gave us a simple response, that he will stand against the other 7. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, it is up to the individual to think about this tour of the spots.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some groups will prioritize the spots for private points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, additional discussions will inevitably occur when opinions break up in
            this
            way. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe was so frightened that I decided to ask Ryuen about it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can I ask why?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s obvious, right? I want the private points. I don&#39;t think of it
            as
            &quot;just 30,000&quot; points.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Each class can earn 60,000 points with two people in total. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is only grains of dust compared to 800,000,000, but it is also a steady
            step.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s no reason not to pick up the money that&#39;s dropping in front
            of
            you. So just shut up and listen to me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although there is a risk of running out of time or not scoring enough points due
            to
            mismanagement, there are basically no disadvantages to this spot tour. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you comply with the rules and achieve your goals, you will receive private
            points
            from the school. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, there is only a positive element. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is true that not getting what you could get is a loss. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, of course, Kitou was not going to stay silent about Ryuen ignoring the other
            7&#39;s opinions with his bullish attitude.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You telling everyone to go along with what you want?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah. Got a problem?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s a disregard for democracy. In this case, I think it is a question
            to
            be decided by majority vote.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Who gives a shit? When did this group become a democracy or
            whatever?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not convinced that you&#39;re obsessed with a small sum of money in
            the
            first place. There&#39;s no way I can believe that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What the fuck do you think it is, then?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I already lost count of how many times this has happened. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Kitou and Ryuen collided, no one could speak out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You didn&#39;t like that the group agreed, so you spoke up in order to stir
            things up.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see, that may actually be true. It&#39;s not a bad thing to see your
            discontent expression.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If we let these two continue to talk, things will soon be heading in a dangerous
            direction.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We need some private points to use public transport. If you subtract that,
            you
            won&#39;t end up with 30,000 private points per person, will you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know the exact amount at this time, but we&#39;ll have to spend some
            money. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even then. Even if the reward drops to nearly 20,000, I&#39;m not going to
            give
            up going for it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I noticed that only our group was left around the bus. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In the meantime, your precious time is being wasted. You know that,
            don&#39;t
            you, Kitou?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just agree and find the proper route. That&#39;s what Ryuen is pressuring us to
            do.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, this comment, which seems to add fuel to the fire, is not going to
            make
            Kitou quiet. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I refuse. If you&#39;re going to stick to your private points and ignore
            other
            opinions, I&#39;m not going to help you around the spots. In other words, rather than gaining
            private
            points, it is tomorrow&#39;s deprivation of free time that is inevitable.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that Kitou intends on fully striking back, and he assured Ryuen that he
            would not agree. So, he strongly protested again.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Heh-heh, you&#39;re the one that&#39;ll be in the minority, Kitou. After
            all,
            over time, these people will have no choice but to obey me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Does he intend to start a patience contest that will be of no benefit to any one?
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The easiest way to move the unyielding Ryuen is to turn the rudder in the
            direction
            of collecting private points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even for the six of us, the 30,000 income is not a bad story, and has advantages
            too.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Besides, if we are guaranteed free time tomorrow, we can make up for the
            sightseeing
            we can&#39;t do today. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the six members, excluding Kitou, lean toward Ryuen, that will be the majority
            opinion. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even if everyone is forced to obey you, I will not.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In that case, Kitou would be turned into a villain in a seven-to-one fashion.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re saying that you&#39;ll destroy the group all by yourself,
            maybe
            that would be worth me giving up the money, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;d welcome that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou showed no signs of faltering, as if saying that he was used to being the
            villain. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, calm down, Kitou. If it&#39;s going to cost us our free time,
            then..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who had been timid up until now, had no choice but to interrupt them.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then you have to talk Ryuen out of it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ugh...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe is very troubled. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right, Nishino. You&#39;re Ryuen&#39;s classmate, try to
            convince
            him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s easy to talk to him, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll change
            his
            mind, right? I won&#39;t do anything useless.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure Nishino, who has known him for a long time, will see the results
            ahead.
            She was already in the mood to give up because she knew there was nothing to do. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...hey, listen for a second. What do you think I should do in this
            situation?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida pulled my arm and asked so at after going a little distance away. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought following Ryuen&#39;s lead would be the best choice, but now
            Kitou is
            making trouble too. Yet, if we go with Kitou, then Ryuen won&#39;t move. They&#39;re always
            trying to get
            their own way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Showing their bad sides, both of them were being called out.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not like there is no solution.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...is that so?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it if I don&#39;t have to.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can you at least tell me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What Ryuen wants are private points, so sightseeing is not necessary.
            Meanwhile, what the seven of us want is to go wherever we want and enjoy sightseeing. Kitou has
            a similiar
            opinion, too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mhm. It&#39;s a conflict, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then the seven of us can use our own money. Well, Kitou will oppose, so I
            guess
            it would be six of us in actuality. If we generate 5,000 private points per person and give them
            to Ryuen,
            he won&#39;t have any complaints, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, I see, so there is such a solution...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, it&#39;s Ryuen. He might not be convinced just by us personally paying him
            30,000. I kept listening to Kushida and talking about the risks. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When this group receives the reward, each class will receive 60,000 private
            points.
            In other words, he would demand to, at least collect 30,000 for Nishino from the same class too.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if Nishino declined, Ryuen would eventually demand it to put them into his
            own
            pocket. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That would cost 60,000 private points total for five people, with 12,000 private
            points per person.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There will also be a resistance to paying that much just to enjoy sightseeing.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s...definitely not cheap.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s supposed to be a sightseeing tour where we would only win, but it&#39;s
            turning into a loss. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, I doubt we can earnestly enjoy the sightseeing. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Also, the majority&#39;s succumbing to the minority&#39;s imposing stance only
            creates a bad example as a group. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;And, worst of all, we have to think about the risk of him asking for
            more.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? That&#39;s so ridiculous...but he might...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I understand what you&#39;re trying to say, Ayanokoji-kun. That&#39;s why
            you
            don&#39;t recommend it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s best to put it all together without any cheap tricks.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not easy to have a peaceful conversation. Impossible, even,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, it is hard to imagine Ryuen or Kitou breaking easily, and it is
            inevitable
            that we will be stranded. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes. Why don&#39;t we just test their patience? We have to work hard to
            collect
            more than 20 points, right? If we wait here for 30 minutes, or an hour, it will be very
            difficult.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A strategy to let them use up the time they would need to score on the spots?
            However, this choice also contains various issues. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even if Ryuen decides that there is not enough time, there is no guarantee
            that
            we will enjoy sightseeing by visiting the spots quietly afterwards. In the end, it collapses.
            Tomorrow&#39;s
            free time will definitely be gone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah...right. It would be really obvious, too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There are not many options available here. We have to be prepared to take a few
            risks
            and try to summarize the situation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t want to throw away my precious day either. We have to bear with
            some pain in order to move here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...What will you do?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I drew one conclusion, but I noticed something important before that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if it was to avoid being overheard by others, I&#39;ve been close to Kushida
            for
            too long. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Clearly, the picture of only Kushida and I having a confidential conversation is
            blatantly highlighted. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You... you&#39;re dating Karuizawa, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe said so with a little squinting.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amikura doesn&#39;t have a good face either. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s a strategy meeting. Isn&#39;t that right, Kushida?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course. I just came to an agreement with Ayanokoji-kun.
            Right?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, Kushida suddenly separated from me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Looking like trying to get away from a disgusting person, it wasn&#39;t a very
            pleasant reaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, it seems that Watanabe and the others were convinced by this, so it must
            be
            the right move. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She recovered her mind and approached Kitou, who was constantly glancing at us,
            and
            Ryuen, who was looking at his phone unwittingly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, I turned my back to the two and faced the five other members. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There was something I wanted to check again with all the members except for
            Ryuen and Kitou. I would like to take a recount of what the opinions are at this stage. Whether
            to
            prioritize sightseeing, or private points. I would like you to raise your hand if there is
            someone who has
            changed their opinion to the latter. You don&#39;t have to pay attention to the atmosphere, just
            show me
            what you want.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe and the others looked at each other, but no one raised their hands.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Looking at the attitudes, it&#39;s clear that no one is lying. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, no one agrees with the policy of aiming for high scores instead
            of
            sightseeing. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So what? No matter what you say, I won&#39;t change my mind,
            Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I know that you don&#39;t care, even if you don&#39;t have allies to help you.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I want to talk to the other five now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After looking back once, I immediately cut my gaze from Ryuen and continued
            talking
            to the five of them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Now that we&#39;re in this situation, I concluded that there was no way all
            eight of us could come together, and that it would be a waste of time to try to come to an
            agreement.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So what are you going to do? Go along with Ryuen?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As one of those who wants to go sightseeing, Nishino did not hide her discontent.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, that&#39;s not happening. Individual opinions should be respected to
            the
            greatest extent possible, but as a group, he is only one in eight. It must be that way.
            Kitou&#39;s
            opposition against Ryuen, that is also one in eight. Even without my input, the five people here
            have a say
            of five out of eight, more than half.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I know that. But, the problem is that we can&#39;t come to an agreement,
            right?
            One out of eight or five out of eight, we all have to make the same choice to move
            forwards.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right. However, it is undoubtedly the five people who have the
            right
            to decide what to do in this situation. If you cannot agree with Ryuen&#39;s methods and way of
            thinking,
            then you don&#39;t have to obey him. In other words, you can make him let go of his choice to
            earn private
            points. We can all drop the idea of visiting the spots right now and just do our own sightseeing
            at our
            leisure.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...do you mean to throw away tomorrow&#39;s free conduct?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. Even if you act as Ryuen has planned, I can&#39;t
            guarantee
            that tomorrow&#39;s free movement will get you where you want to go. If someone says that they
            won&#39;t
            leave the ryokan, at that point the group won&#39;t even be able to go outside. On the other
            hand,
            today&#39;s freedom is guaranteed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Only until 5 o&#39;clock though, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s not true. Until 5 pm, the group is going to go around the spots
            and
            think about free movement until tomorrow. We have a right to come back to the ryokan at any time
            we want
            until 9 pm. Moreover, you can act on your own free will. We can even split into groups of good
            friends. The
            school can&#39;t criticize us for that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Abandoning Day 4 and turning Day 3 into complete freedom of movement that no one
            can
            imitate. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is the absolute authority that only the five are allowed to exercise.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not Ryuen or Kitou who will decide what to do, I want you to think
            well about that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...that&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida looks into the eyes of the members without unnecessary conversation and
            is
            convinced that their opinions are united as one. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ryuen, we are not after all aiming to earn private points. Today we want to
            talk about where we want to go, and have an enjoyable day. If you can&#39;t obey, then we&#39;ll
            probably
            end up dispersing from here. What happens after that is exactly as Ayanokoji said. Maybe we can
            all get
            along for a day of study tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nishino laughed at the words, and Amikura, Watanabe, and Yamamura nodded to
            prepare
            themselves. Kitou slightly raised the corner of his lips in response. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s good advice. I&#39;ll go along with that, too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou, who was simply opposing Ryuen until now, went to the side of the five.
            With
            everyone having come to a conclusion, the ball is effectively passed to Ryuen for the first
            time. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In accordance with the opinions of Kushida and the others, he will either give up
            his
            &nbsp;private points, or rebel and disperse.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Either way, he won&#39;t get the private points he wants. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In fact, he will even have to be in the study session tomorrow. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Now you&#39;ve done it, huh, Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He expressed his dissatisfaction in words, but did not appear to be truly
            dissatisfied. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure the people around me just see this as a show of strength, though.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, I&#39;d hate to come all the way here on a trip just to study.
            I&#39;ll
            go along with you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought there might still be some resistance, but Ryuen backed down. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If he could get private points by dispersing, he would have done so without
            hesitation, but he avoided trouble when he knew that there was nothing to gain. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, we, group 6, followed the school&#39;s instructions and went on a
            fitting
            trip, visiting spots around the city centre and visiting the zoo that we wanted to go to.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As a result, the score collected was less than 20 points, but it was a meaningful
            and
            satisfying way to pass the time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.2dlolyb"><span>Part </span><span class="c15">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Day 3, dinner. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The previous two days, breakfast and dinner were Japanese-style course meals, but
            from this evening and until breakfast the day after tomorrow, when we will return home, the menu
            will be
            changed to an all-you-can-eat buffet format. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, this is my first experience with an all-you-can-eat. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for the meals, just like up until yesterday, we could freely eat at any table
            we
            wanted without worrying about group movement. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Many students were already crowded together and walking around with their
            trays.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My girlfriend Kei is also together with the girls today, and I can hear her
            laughter
            even from afar. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now that I&#39;m on my own without any interruptions, I&#39;m watching the other
            students around me and learning how this works.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that the customers take a tray from the stack, freely combine the dishes
            in
            the tray, and pick up the dishes one after the other along a predetermined route. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">First, I&#39;ll take a salad bowl and put in it lettuce, tomatoes, onions,
            pickles
            and such. You can choose from five different types of dressings, so I chose onion dressing.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...This is interesting.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unlike predetermined meals, making detailed choices on your own gives you a
            strong
            sense of individuality. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without realizing, you end up making a nutritionally balanced meal. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, the surrounding students varied in their patterns, with some
            taking the same kind of food as the members they&#39;re eating with, and others preparing many
            kinds at once
            in small quantities. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, as I lined up in the vegetable row, students began to gather behind me.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought there would not be many students here for an early dinner, but it is
            rather
            the opposite. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that many of the students were aiming for the opening time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even though Japanese cuisine is the main thing,, there are also steaks, shumai,
            corn
            soup, and such.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yo, Ayanokoji. Are you actually going to eat alone?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I was trying to find a seat after putting everything in order, Ishizaki, who
            was
            empty handed, called out to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I am.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Eat with me, then. I just called Nishino too, since she was alone. It&#39;s
            lonely to eat by yourself, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No...well, that&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since there is no real reason to refuse, I should go along with Ishizaki&#39;s
            kindness here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nishino raised her hand slightly as I followed Ishizaki to our seats. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, Albert seemed to be there too, and I felt him look at me through his
            sunglasses. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I sat down next to a tray with a large amount of food that seems to belong to
            Ishizaki. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, I still have something I gotta go grab. You can start eating
            first.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the reason that he was empty handed when he called out to me, is that he was
            going
            to get something. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ishizaki returned to the place lined with food while singing a song.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re here because of Ishizaki&#39;s meddling too, huh?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I refused, but he was persistent.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He&#39;s not the type to leave his friends alone.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess. He was a lot more gloomy and sharp when he first enrolled in the
            school.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Certainly, he has very bright image these days, but it may not be the same as
            when he
            first enrolled. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ve had almost no contact with him, so it&#39;s only natural that he
            hasn&#39;t
            left an impression on me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He didn&#39;t seem to like Ryuen at first, so maybe it&#39;s that his
            rebellious spirit is strong.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps I didn&#39;t see it because he was being suppressed, but this must be
            Ishizaki as he is supposed to be. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Albert, however, who is eating alone in silence, is the one person that
            hasn&#39;t
            changed a bit. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He&#39;s skilfully using the chopsticks with his big hands. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright! I brought crabs! So many crabs!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When Ishizaki came back, he put a large plate on the tray, and there was only a
            large
            amount of crabs piled up there. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the momentum of putting them on the table, the crab legs fell into the
            tray.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 8/images/image10.jpg" title=""></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...There&#39;s so much.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re in Hokkaido, you eat crabs, right? I&#39;ve always been after
            these guys, so I rushed to grab them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re really vulgar, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Indeed, among the colourful menu, the crabs attracted many students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&#39;t want to be part of the herd, so I gave up trying to get one on the
            first
            lap. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean vulgar? This is viking time, you know! I&#39;ll take all I
            want!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ishizaki&#39;s theory is that if you don&#39;t take it, you lose it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;First of all, can you stop saying viking? It&#39;s really
            lame.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? What else should I call it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s buffet. Buffet!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[TL Note 28 : Ishizaki calls the buffet &quot;viking&quot; in the above exchange.
            Since buffets were popularized in Sweden, he jokingly uses the word &quot;viking&quot; to
            reference this.
            The usage of the word &quot;viking&quot; to mean &quot;buffet&quot; also appears in Japanese
            dictionaries.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Buffet? No, isn&#39;t that way worse? What the hell&#39;s
            that?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I think that they have different rules for what to call it, but what Nishino
            cares
            more about than that is the pile of crabs on the plate.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...that doesn&#39;t matter. I was looking forward to the viking,
            so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...what about the other people? Crab is one of the main
            dishes.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? If I thought about other people, then they would take it from me.
            Besides,
            this is an all you can eat, so they must have plenty prepared for everyone.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, that does make sense too, in its own way. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Ishizaki pointed out, the chef was leisurely replenishing the boiled crabs.
            Worst
            case, if he says that he can eat it all, then we have no right to stop him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, no way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying so, Nishino turned her gaze away from Ishizaki and scooped the chawanmushi
            and
            brought it to her mouth with a spoon.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 29 : &#33590;&#30871;&#33976;&#12375; Chawanmushi; savoury steamed egg
            custard with chicken, mushrooms, etc.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for Albert eating in silence next to us... His chosen line up included boiled
            eggplant, spinach with sesame paste, various kinds of sashimi, miso soup, rice, and such.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter how you look at it, it is all Japanese food. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You like Japanese food, don&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I said that, Albert placed his chopsticks carefully side by side and, raised
            his
            thumb silently. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he returned to eating right away. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The way he eats is also very polite, more so than Ishizaki, who eats in a gulping
            manner. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, Ayanokoji. You&#39;re in a group with Ryuen, right? Are you handling it
            well?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not doing anything special. The other group members are very
            supportive, so we&#39;re doing reasonably well together.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re talking like you don&#39;t know that there was a fight at the
            ski
            resort.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As one of the parties involved, Nishino reminded me of what happened. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Did they have a fight with someone from another school? Shit, I wish I was
            there too!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It would have been even worse with you there. Why are men so hot
            blooded?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That being said, Nishino looked pretty brave too. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to become a shield for Yamamura who got in trouble, Nishino talked back
            without fear.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re a hot-blooded woman too, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ishizaki cackled as he stuffed his cheeks with crab. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Shut up. Also, stop spitting out food scraps everywhere, it&#39;s
            dirty.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You aren&#39;t bothering Ryuen-san either, right? Listen well to his
            orders,
            okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can be as loyal as you want, but why should I have to follow him
            too?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She&#39;s still playing catch, even while arguing with Ishizaki.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[TL Note 30 - The word in the original is literally &quot;catch ball&quot; as it

            between
            them.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I guess they are classmates who know each other thoroughly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, from what I can see, although Nishino doesn&#39;t speak much, she does
            not
            seem to cause any trouble, and she also has a kind-hearted side, showing concern for Yamamura.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve been wondering, Nishino, but aren&#39;t you afraid of
            Ryuen?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, when he gets serious, it feels really dangerous, but, you know...
            &nbsp;My idiot brother was a delinquent too, so maybe I have a little resistance.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So there is a similar type in her family. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then I can see why she is so confident in talking back in fights. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It was obvious he would struggle if he didn&#39;t take school seriously.
            Despite that, my stupid brother dropped out of high school, couldn&#39;t find a job, and had a
            really hard
            time.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if it was unpleasant to remember, she sighed a few times as she spoke. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What happened to him?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The local construction company picked him up and he works hard at the site
            every day. For a very low salary, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is precisely because she has seen the reality, that she can only sigh when she
            thinks about Ryuen or Ishizaki&#39;s futures. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Doing whatever you want now will cause you trouble later. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This should be common sense through all of society, whether you&#39;re a
            delinquent
            or not. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The higher education you have, the better it is for you, except in the
            entertainment
            and creative industries, where talent is important, and in the sports industry, where physical
            ability is
            important.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The more you work hard and add on to your studies, the more likely you are to
            start
            from an easier position later. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Despite how you look, you&#39;re pretty smart, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You didn&#39;t need to say &quot;despite how you look&quot;. Besides,
            anyone
            would look smart from your point of view.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A-ha-ha! Maybe you&#39;re right!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From Ishizaki&#39;s perspective, almost any student would be an honour student.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I finished my meal and was about to leave the venue, a man, Katsuragi, came
            into
            my sight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He is eating alone at a table in the corner, silently bringing food to his mouth
            by
            himself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was worried about his appearance, so I observed a little, and I saw a strange
            scene
            from there. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When Oda from the Ryuen class spotted Katsuragi and was about to call out to him,
            Matoba from A Class stopped Oda, said something, then Oda headed towards a different student
            while keeping
            eyes on Katsuragi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was as if her coming into contact with Katsuragi was obstructed on
            purpose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This happened not just once, but continued on for a second and third time. Matoba
            is
            a member of group 2, like Katsuragi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he should have been at the table with Katsuragi, but he was doing the exact
            opposite. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Among A Class, there seems to be people doing some very shady things. I could
            have
            left it alone, but I decided to try to contact Katsuragi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, as soon as he sensed that I was approaching, he approached me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m in a bit of a group event with Katsuragi right now. Could you leave
            him
            alone?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see. If he says that it is an issue of group 2 alone, then I have no choice but
            to
            pull back, even if we are classmates. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s why Oda quickly understood and left too. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Is this the consensus of A Class, or is this an arbitrary act of Matoba alone?
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I wondered if there was any intention to defeat the Ryuen Class behind it.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Either way, as a third party, this behaviour can&#39;t be seen as anything but
            malicious bullying.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A new visitor appeared near Matoba who was giving me a warning. Matoba turned his
            body around to stop them, but his thoughts quickly changed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ugh...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He gulped, and, as if he had never made an obstruction in the first place, turned
            his
            back. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, Katsuragi. You&#39;re eating with a very gloomy face,
            huh?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is not surprising that Matoba could not say anything, as the visitor was
            Ryuen.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He clicked his tongue and immediately ran away at the unexpected appearance of
            the
            big shot.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 31 - The word used for Ryuen here is &#22823;&#29289; Oomono, meaning -

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without even a glance at Matoba&#39;s back, he sat down in the seat in front of
            Katsuragi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m eating. You want something?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I wanted to get closer to see that wretched look on your face
            better.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He-he. That&#39;s what it&#39;s like to betray your class. It&#39;s too
            late
            for regrets now, Katsuragi.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t regret anything. I don&#39;t know what to do with a leader that
            can&#39;t be restraint, but I&#39;m ready to commit a double suicide with my current
            class.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether he was trying to hide his embarrassment or not, it was a roundabout way
            of
            saying it, but, it is clear that he has the resolve as a member of the Ryuen Class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen, sitting there, pulled out a chair and slid an empty glass in front of me.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Bring me some water, Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Dealing with you in public, I don&#39;t have to be afraid of you in the
            slightest. This is too easy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;From the moment that the group was formed, I knew you were going to be
            rough
            with me, but... good grief.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll go.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unable to ignore this, Katsuragi offered so, but I gently stopped him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m thirsty, so it&#39;s fine.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I also caught a glimpse of Ryuen&#39;s concern for Katsuragi, who was eating
            alone.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I&#39;ll agree for now. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.sqyw64"><span>Part </span><span class="c15">2</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen and I remained until Katsuragi finished his meal, then we left the dining
            hall.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can see Kushida sitting down in a chair near the entrance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida stood up after seeing us, and approached without hesitation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ryuen-kun, can I talk to you for a second?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, she was waiting for Ryuen to come out here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With how quickly we ate, it was hard to think that Kushida, a girl, had finished
            her
            meal before us.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems safe to assume that she had something she wanted to talk to Ryuen about,
            and
            prepared so in advance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Katsuragi read the air, and quickly went back to the room alone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? What do you want?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Not here... I want to go somewhere else, if that&#39;s okay?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because of the eyes around, Kushida was in her usual public mode, but she seemed
            a
            bit strange. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry, but I ain&#39;t interested in you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A-ha-ha, that&#39;s not it, though. So, don&#39;t worry. I also feel the
            same
            way about you, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida, while keeping a watchful eye on the surroundings, directed her sparkling
            killing intent toward Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, whatever, I&#39;ll listen to what you have to say. We can get rid of
            the
            troublemaker, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for the troublemaker, it is of course me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida also followed along and apologized, so I should pull back here. The two
            walked side by side towards an uncrowded direction. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I leave them like this, things are going to fall in the wrong direction. I
            decided
            to hide myself, and follow the two of them. Exercising extreme caution, however. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was right to be cautious, as Ryuen seemed to be keeping an eye behind
            him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So? What are you going to tell me now that you&#39;re alone with
            me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s about the relationship between me and you. Even when we were
            moving as
            a group, you sometimes said things that were unnecessary. I&#39;d like you to stop doing
            that.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As far as I could see, Ryuen hinted at revealing Kushida&#39;s secret twice
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is only natural that she is not pleased about that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you want with me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do I want? I&#39;m not going to do anything right now.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...So, you mean you&#39;ll do something someday?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From what I can hear, there is a slight lack of composure in Kushida&#39;s voice.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You sold your soul to the devil because you wanted to get rid of Suzune,
            didn&#39;t you? Naturally, there is a risk involved with that. &nbsp;We can&#39;t just forget
            about the past
            now, you know?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right. I think that&#39;s true.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even so, your appearance has changed a lot, Kikyou. &nbsp;The old you
            wouldn&#39;t have thought of pressing me here even if I had provoked you. Isn&#39;t that
            right?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen sensed that something was strange. He shouldn&#39;t know anything about the
            unanimous special exam, but he does have a keen sense of smell, so I guess he can feel
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Perhaps someone came along who accepts your true nature?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can speculate all you want, but that&#39;s not it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Heh-heh. Either way, for me, you&#39;re one of the necessary keys for my
            class
            strategy. When I have to deal with the Suzune class, I will use this weapon without
            mercy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So far, he has intentionally not mentioned the case of Kushida. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that he will leave it as one of the measures to effectively cause damage
            in
            more important situations in the future. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is an obstacle for Kushida, who has recovered and decided to serve the class
            for
            herself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It cannot be easily removed and she will continue to be made to suffer. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you going to do? Will you get on your knees and beg me not to tell
            anyone? Or will you get rid of me and expel me? Both seem difficult.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida cannot be allowed to choose either of those options. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if a third option were to emerge, it is the same. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry, Ryuen, but you have to stand down on the Kushida
            matter.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I stopped hiding and decided to expose myself to the two of them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Tch. So you did follow us?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, Ayanokoji-kun!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I already considered that you would be on guard.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whatever. So? What do you mean stand down on the case of
            Kikyou?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It means it as it is. I know you intend to reveal Kushida&#39;s secret, but
            I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d stop.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Upon receiving the warning, Ryuen laughed and clapped in amusement. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ha-ha-ha! What the hell Ayanokoji, you&#39;re involved in this shit too
            after
            all? And the fact that you say that, it means that she&#39;s no longer the cancer of the class
            like
            before.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Getting the answer that cleared his doubts, Ryuen pleasantly laughed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right. Kushida is now taking a new step as Horikita&#39;s classmate.
            I&#39;m
            not going to let you ruin that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but things are going to get even more interesting. Let&#39;s
            take our interests out of the equation and get things going now, shall we?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No one will believe what you say, Ryuen-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida, not being able to stand it here, opposed Ryuen, but he won&#39;t stop
            with
            such words. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How about it? You never know until you try with these things.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">What is needed now is not a half-hearted verbal deterrent, but a complete
            containment
            of his movements. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you decide to expose her, no one can stop you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida could not hide her anxiety and humiliation, so I tapped her on the
            shoulder
            and told her not to worry. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But if you do that, you won&#39;t be able to achieve your goal of fighting
            Sakayanagi in the final exams of the school year.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? Why is that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll deal with it in a way you wouldn&#39;t want.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if in response to my words, Ryuen&#39;s smile instantly turned
            suspicious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just like when he had fearlessly abducted Kei in the past, or even more
            so.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hah. Look at that, you haven&#39;t shown me that expression in quite a
            while.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I came between Ryuen and Kushida and moved closer to Ryuen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Now, even if I choose silence here, there&#39;s no guarantee that I
            won&#39;t
            expose her, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen showed a strong appearance, but he finally raised his hands lightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about this. In the first place, I don&#39;t want
            to
            attack your class with Kikyou&#39;s story. No, I should say I&#39;m not feeling like that any
            more.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If it wasn&#39;t for Ayanokoji&#39;s entanglement, this wouldn&#39;t have
            become a weapon.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Im sure you don&#39;t know, Kikyou, but this guy told me yesterday that he
            doesn&#39;t want to expel you from the school any more. So if I used this information, it
            wouldn&#39;t
            affect you, right, Ayanokoji?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve already thought about countermeasures.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It makes no sense to hit you with a strategy that won&#39;t get through and
            then get reversed back at me. Right? I&#39;ve already learned that I can&#39;t defeat you with
            half-measures.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without being mean, I am sure that he will challenge Horikita&#39;s class in a
            way
            and with a plan that I can&#39;t even think of. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m going to go back to my room now. Bye, Kushida, enjoy the rest of
            your
            school life.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Don&#39;t stop me any more. With that implication, Ryuen returned to the guest
            room.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He changed from calling her Kikyou to calling her Kushida. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Is that the flip side of the complete loss of interest from Ryuen? Only me and
            Kushida were left here, and silence came. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Why... did you come to my rescue? It has no merit for you, does
            it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There is a merit. You&#39;re an indispensable resource for the class. Even
            if I
            hadn&#39;t come here, Ryuen wouldn&#39;t have been willing to expose you, but I didn&#39;t know
            how you
            would act. You were wondering if you could do something to close his mouth first,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Well, yes...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ryuen is not an enemy you can reach. It would be troublesome if you were to
            blow yourself up in a battle that you didn&#39;t have to fight. That&#39;s why I decided to show
            myself.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So you&#39;re saying that you could help me out, Ayanokoji-kun? Actually...
            I
            guess you already did, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;At least at this stage, I don&#39;t think we should recognize Ryuen as a
            strong
            enemy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Huh? What do you mean..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Anyway, you don&#39;t have to cross the dangerous bridge any more. Just
            take
            care of yourself for now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Such pompous words. Do you need my strength for the class that
            much?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s also true.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Also?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I feel like I can work well with you now that we can talk
            frankly.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My ability to see into her secret side has increased the number of factors that
            make
            it easier to infer what she is thinking. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Stop it. People who know my true nature can&#39;t really think that
            way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure she&#39;s most acutely aware of the fact that she has a personality
            that&#39;s not well-liked. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s not true. I honestly have good feelings towards
            you.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What...do you really mean that? I don&#39;t trust you, Ayanokoji-kun,
            so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The usual Kushida would reply with a smile, but her expression was stiff. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This is the truth. Some people in the world find your true nature more
            comfortable.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I said something like that, Kushida looked at me, opened her mouth wide, and
            stopped moving. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then she suddenly walked towards the wall.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...what?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Immediately after that, she spread her arms out, put her palms out, and then
            fully
            put her hands on the wall. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She muttered so, and stopped moving. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I watched to see what was going on, Kushida, who had regained control of her
            breathing, looked back at me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I feel a little dizzy, but I&#39;m okay now!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida raised her voice in an odd way, appealing to me not to worry. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Are you really okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida showed her usual front face, even though she did not appear to be in very
            good condition. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mhm. I&#39;m good!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I... I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In Kushida&#39;s case, it&#39;s really hard to read her emotions. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Somehow, I was saved by you, Ayanokoji-kun. ...thanks.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I feel like you&#39;ve been thanking me more these days.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That might me so... Yeah, from now on, I&#39;ll leave Ryuen-kun
            alone.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That would be good.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll go back to my room now. See you tomorrow, okay?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kushida walked down the hallway with a completely restored expression. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, she stumbled on the way and fell down again, and one of her clogs
            magnificently flew off.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you alright?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m fine! So! Okay!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She brushed me off with her hand, telling me not to approach her, then staggered
            to
            her feet and put her clog back on. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since I had a meeting with Horikita, I waited in the hallway from the guest room
            with
            my back against the wall. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m a little late.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although Horikita showed up while apologizing, there was no problem because she
            was
            not really late. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You were fast, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you intend on talking here?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Students are constantly entering and leaving this room near the guest room.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s one of the least suitable places to talk about things you don&#39;t want
            to
            hear. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s definitely not a good place to talk. Yes, that&#39;s right. I
            think we
            should go to the vending machine and have a drink. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to talk while
            walking?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That would be fine, I don&#39;t have any particular objection. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Standing-up conversations attract a lot of attention, but if you chat while
            walking,
            you don&#39;t have to worry about it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The vending machine in front of the bathhouse was selling fruit milk. It
            was
            delicious.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was told that it was something to drink after going to the bath, and I really
            thought that was true.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thanks for the childish comment. But it&#39;s not something you drink in
            the
            middle of the night, is it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Is it a time issue? No, from a girl&#39;s point of view, that might be especially
            true. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But the vending machine at the public bath would put us farther away from
            here,
            so let&#39;s go over there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita&#39;s steps are slow, and she moves in a way that prioritizes talking
            first.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s about that day at the culture festival. I&#39;ve been meaning to
            ask
            you, but I never had the opportunity to do so. It&#39;s stuck with me for a long time, since I
            couldn&#39;t
            find the right timing until today.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You must have been tired at that time, you seemed to have exposed your
            sleeping
            face unprotected.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...want me to kick you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I immediately raised my white flag as I was shown her eager upper body stance.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Forgive me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s such a blunder. To show a boy my sleeping face. You&#39;ve
            disgraced
            me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is it really something to worry about that much?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course it is... just forget about that now. I want to ask about that
            day.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita brushed her embarrassment away with her hand, and her face turned
            serious.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What happened in the student council room that day, didn&#39;t you have
            something to do with it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The festival, that day, the student council room, there is only one event that
            these
            can lead to. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Did you expel Yagami-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Why do you think that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m not dodging the question, I was just interested in the reason why she
            came up
            with that answer. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know if you knew, but it&#39;s possible that Yagami-kun was
            trying
            to expel you. In fact, his behaviour in the student council room was enough to support
            that.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita, in her own way, seems to have a few pieces that I don&#39;t know about.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Using these pieces, it&#39;s no surprise that what happened was seen by her.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I didn&#39;t know about Yagami, but I guess that shouldn&#39;t come as a
            surprise. &nbsp;You knew first hand that Housen was trying to get me expelled, didn&#39;t
            you?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s the 20,000,000 private points reward.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yagami was in on it, and he was waiting for an opportunity,
            right?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought about that, too. But, there are too many strange points. Above
            all,
            he wasn&#39;t trying to get close to you for money.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that Horikita, who was present at that scene, knows more about it.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;All of the possible answers weigh on my mind. But that&#39;s not what I
            want to
            know the most.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then what do you want to know?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Your true identity. I can&#39;t think of you as an ordinary student like
            any
            other.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s a troubling question. If I am not normal, then what kind of
            student
            would I be?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not about being superior or not. I just
            can&#39;t
            imagine what kind of person you are. I don&#39;t understand.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">What kind of person is Kiyokata Ayanokoji? Is that what she wants to know?
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&#39;s nothing special to talk about. In fact, I don&#39;t have
            enough to
            actually talk about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then, can you answer my questions if I ask? Your birthplace, graduated
            elementary school, junior high school. Have you been to any competitions in the past? Did you
            study on your
            own, or with a private tutor, or cram school?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I bet they don&#39;t ask so many questions even on a blind date. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know what you&#39;re trying to say, but I don&#39;t feel like receiving
            so
            many troublesome questions.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita&#39;s lips are knotted and she showed blatantly her
            dissatisfaction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to disclose some information.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...What kind of information?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;For example, right. The fact that I was involved in the Yagami case, just
            as
            you had been suspecting.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re not joking, right? Because Yagami-kun was trying to expel
            you?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I didn&#39;t know for certain that it was Yagami. It is more correct to say
            that I set up a trap for the student who was trying to expel me, and Yagami got caught in it.
            Student
            Council President Nagumo, Ryuen and the others were also there... I set all of that up. I
            enclosed them, so
            that they could not make half-hearted excuses.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Until now, I didn&#39;t see any meaning in telling this to Horikita. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, I can give her the data by indirectly showing what kind of person I
            am.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For when we eventually come into conflict, I will make sure to create a
            possibility
            to put this to good use.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Incidentally, there is no connection between the student council president
            and
            Ryuen. I only talked to them both separately.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That discomfort I felt that day... I think I get it now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;By the way, we&#39;re almost at our destination.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We took the stairs up to the second floor where the large bathing area is
            located,
            and arrived at the resting area where the vending machine is. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, there were two female teachers who had monopolized two massage chairs. They
            were very relaxed, giving themselves over to the massage, and did not notice us.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 8/images/image8.jpg" title=""></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita and I looked at each other once. We could ignore them, but Horikita
            chose to
            speak up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like you are very comfortable here, you two.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...eh? Ah, it&#39;s Horikita-san~&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hoshinomiya-sensei replied, raising only her wrist and flapping her hand. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Isn&#39;t it about to be bed time for the students, and time for the
            teachers
            to be working?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How unfortunate~. It&#39;s like a half day for us today, so~. Right?
            Sae-chan.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Leaving herself to the rattling massage chair, Chabashira-sensei closed her eyes
            comfortably. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That thing, does it feel that good?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was interested in using it, but I couldn&#39;t because of the eyes of students
            who
            frequently came and went because it was adjacent to the large bathroom. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Massage becomes indispensable when you get older. We do a lot of hard work
            that
            you young people don&#39;t know about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that with physical decline comes the need for equipment to support it.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Especially in Sae-chan&#39;s case, her shoulders are very
            stiff.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You didn&#39;t need to say that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For a moment, the teacher&#39;s sharp gazes interleaved with each other. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even so, Horikita-san, you&#39;ve completely become a leader. Asking as the
            former B Class home room teacher, do you feel comfortable in B class?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Not really. What I am aiming for is &nbsp;A Class. This is just a crossing
            point now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see what you&#39;re saying.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ignoring the conversation, I picked up the remote control connected to
            Chabashira-sensei&#39;s massage machine. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There seem to be five levels of strength, and now it is working with level 3.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, the stronger it is, the more effective it will be. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For some reason, I was curious about how the strength of the fifth level would
            feel,
            so I changed it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Nn, ah, nnh!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Chabashira-sensei jumped with surprise, the machine started making a strong
            grating sound. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought it would be about a 40% increase in functionality, but it may be more
            than
            that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A, Ayanokoji, wha-what are you doing, nnh! Turn, turn it back!&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She reached for the remote control in clear panic. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She pulled the cord by force, and the remote control fell from my hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ugh, uugh! Hyah, ha-ha, quickly, get it!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Please don&#39;t pull it then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I picked up the remote control and went from five to three levels of strength.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hah, hah... hah, hah... what the hell are you doing!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, I was just curious. I wondered if the stronger it was, the better it
            would
            be.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course not! It has the right strength for each person!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She looked at me angrily, with a bright red face, the most devilish expression I
            have
            ever seen from her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, it was more stimulating than I expected. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you trying to do?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The noisy exchange also attracted attention from Horikita. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We interrupted you during your break. Let&#39;s go,
            Ayanokoji-kun&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you two going to take a bath? You can&#39;t go in
            together.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ignoring the foolish thing Hoshinomiya-sensei said, Horikita turned around.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait, Horikita-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hoshinomiya had been joking around until just before, but I noticed that her face
            had
            changed to a serious one. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Indeed, I think your class has grown remarkably, Horikita-san. Class B must
            aim
            for Class A at the crossing point. I know it&#39;s obvious, but I still think that&#39;s lovely,
            and very
            admirable of you too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It sounded like a compliment, but it had a different meaning. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Chie, don&#39;t say too much.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Isn&#39;t it fine? I&#39;m just trying to say what I think.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but you&#39;re not free to
            say
            what you think.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Please say it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita urged her to say so, as if she was curious about
            Hoshinomiya-sensei&#39;s
            previous words. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I won&#39;t hesitate, then. You see, as a home room teacher with a class, I
            have always been thinking about something. Teachers from A class to D class compete in the same
            way. If I
            had to use an analogy, you could think of it as the teachers as millionaires playing cards with
            each
            other.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Millionaires... huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know the rules, don&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, well...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;With the cards handed out, we fight for three years to determine the
            highest
            and lowest positions from 1 to 4, but millionaires will play with cards with numbers from 1 to
            13, right? If
            we leave aside the local rules and special rules this time, then basically the big number card
            is stronger,
            and the small number card is weaker, right? If a student with only 3 numbers and a student with
            6 numbers
            bump into each other, of course, the student with 6 wins. Mashima&#39;s A Class has a certain
            amount of
            hands, and there are a lot of cards like 10 or 11. On the other hand, the more you go towards D
            Class, the
            more cards there are such as 3 or 4. Well, it&#39;s kind of the school tradition so
            far.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Having said that, Hoshinomiya-sensei took the remote control of the massage
            machine
            and raised the strength of rubbing by one level. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s barely three levels, so I should remember again how strong the fifth
            level
            is.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course, the students change every day. I think a child who was a 3 or a
            4
            could grow up to be a 12 or a 13, or in rare instances, the strongest number of 2. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s why there are fluctuations in the classes, and sometimes the D class
            goes
            up to the B class. Well, it&#39;s extremely rare, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Horikita class has come to an unprecedented place. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, it&#39;s important to fight on an equal footing. That any class is
            always
            fighting within the numbers 1 to 13. If there is injustice or cheating in a certain class, it
            would be no
            good, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, you know..? Don&#39;t you think there&#39;s one card in your class
            that
            shouldn&#39;t be mixed in, Horikita-san?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A card that shouldn&#39;t be mixed in..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hoshinomiya-sensei laughed, and turned her gaze to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, it&#39;s cheating. Sae-chan&#39;s class is the only one in possession
            of a
            joker.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita also noticed the stare, which was as if pointing at a name. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Chie. Enough already.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I can have a couple complaints, right? &nbsp;Even if we are fighting with
            all
            our might, a single joker can turn the situation upside down. No, it is much worse than playing
            with
            millionaires and the like. Because, unlike a card that is gone from your hand after you use it
            once, you can
            use the joker again and again and again. There&#39;s no way I can win.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As a home room teacher, her words could be taken as a declaration of defeat for
            her
            own class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Regardless of the merits of your statement, what will you do if a student
            from
            the D class hears it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A statement acknowledging defeat. Shock is inevitable if students in the Ichinose
            class hear it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...That&#39;s right. Sorry, sorry. Maybe the alcohol is getting to me now
            because of the massage.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She said so, and turned it off. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The joker came into your hands because of the luck of Sae-san and
            Horikita-san.
            If you reach A class with it, it&#39;s not cheating, is it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was obvious to everyone here that it was sarcasm.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s enough already, Chie.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A voice close to intimidation that I&#39;ve never heard up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, Hoshinomiya-sensei&#39;s drunkenness cooled down for a moment, and she
            jumped
            up in a hurry. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m going back to my room! Farewell!!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Slightly peeved, Hoshinomiya-sensei waved her hand and walked down the hallway
            with
            big steps. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sorry for all that. She said it herself, but it must have been the
            alcohol circulating because of the massage.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if defending Hoshinomiya-sensei, Chabashira-sensei replied so while getting up
            from the massage machine.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll just ignore it as drunken non-sense.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita replied with a single, harsh comment, and Chabashira-sensei coughed
            once, a
            little disturbed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re pretty harsh, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You seem a little concerned about what I said earlier,
            teacher.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t have anything to think about, to be honest.
            It&#39;s too different from the class I took three years ago.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is true that there are powerful cards in the Horikita class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know if Ayanokoji-kun is a joker or not, but there is no
            denying
            that he is a powerful classmate. But, I don&#39;t want to hold back because of
            that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without even looking at me, Horikita spoke her mind towards
            Chabashira-sensei.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I will fight with all my might using it, since it is a card that was dealt
            to
            your class, Chabashira-sensei. Because I&#39;m aiming for A class.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right. Of course, that is my intention.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, I am sure that Chabashira-sensei herself thinks that she is not prepared
            enough.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The A class led by Sakayanagi is also packed with solid cards. You may win one
            game,
            but you never know what will happen if you play 10 or 20 games. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well... I&#39;ll go after Chie, then. If I leave her like that, she might
            drink
            too much until the morning.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She couldn&#39;t seem to abandon her friend and old classmate, so she followed
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s it for today, Horikita.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s still so much I want to ask you, though?
            Joker-san.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve come all this way, so I want to take a bath again. Besides, there
            are
            more people here now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Students trying to enjoy a bath before going to bed were beginning to show up.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;ll tell me later. Can I think that way?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I nodded and went straight through the curtain leading to the men&#39;s bath.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was close to 11 pm, so it was about time to turn off the lights. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou stood up silently and headed down the hallway, grabbing several magazines
            he
            had borrowed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&#39;s been reading magazines for a long time while he&#39;s in the
            room,
            huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I guess he likes to read. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unlike me and Hiyori, he doesn&#39;t seem to be the type to read books from the
            library. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A new magazine is held in the hands of Kitou who returned a few minutes later.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He must want to read it immediately when he wakes up in the morning.
            &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The magazines Kitou reads strongly reflect his personal tastes, and most of them
            are
            what one would call fashion magazines.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Will you let me read it a little bit?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought he would just tell me to go get one myself, but Kitou silently put the
            magazine on the table. Does this mean that I can read it as I please? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I decided to read the magazine for a little more than 10 minutes before the
            lights
            went out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It features fashionable clothes, accessories, and more. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Honestly, I don&#39;t understand much of the significance of the magazine&#39;s
            photos or the content of its articles. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, I only knew that Kitou had strong feelings for the magazine.
            &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou&#39;s outfit, which may seem eccentric in its fashion, was a reflection of
            his
            own sense of style and thought. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would have been expected if Ryuen, who often fights with Kitou, would have
            said
            that the topic was boring, but no such words of criticism were exchanged. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Soon it was lights out, and we darkened the room and went to bed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For a while, I looked up at the ceiling quietly, and my sight gradually became
            accustomed to the darkness. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t think everyone is asleep yet, but I wonder what they are thinking.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, Watanabe started talking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;ll be in our third year of high school in half a year, right? Even
            as we
            compete for the A class, we still have to think about the future and think about going to
            school, getting a
            job, etc. I still can&#39;t imagine myself after high school. I don&#39;t want to do anything in
            particular
            either. What about you, Ayanokoji-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;University, I suppose. However, I haven&#39;t decided on a specific
            university
            yet.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ll talk about the goals that would be the safest to let them know of.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kitou?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe was not confident that he would get an answer, but he did not hesitate
            to
            ask.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I&#39;m going to be a fashion designer&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe was doubly surprised as he did not expect to be answered and by the
            content
            of the answer. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Surprised, right? I know that. I can&#39;t imagine it looking from the
            outside.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, no, well... that&#39;s hard to say, but yes...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, it is easy to understand when you think about Kitou&#39;s sense of
            personal
            clothing and the contents of the magazines he reads.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Heh-heh, I think Watanabe would have been more convinced if Kitou said that
            he
            wanted to become a killer.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was worried that Kitou might get angry again at Ryuen for his interruption, but
            no
            action was taken. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Kitou. Ryuen always says things like that,
            so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe tried to follow up, but Kitou really didn&#39;t look like he cared.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m used to it. Most people are surprised and not convinced when I
            tell
            them my dreams. Even if I aim for that path, I don&#39;t think it will be accepted.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There should be no prejudice, but it does exist in this world. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For the tough looking Kitou, the hurdle to pursue some professions may be
            naturally
            high.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But it doesn&#39;t matter if I graduate in A class. I can dive into the
            world
            without question. &nbsp;Once I dive in, all I have to do is silence those around me with my
            skills.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that breaking through the first entrance would be the most difficult
            thing
            for Kitou to do. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re really thinking about the future, huh... No, it&#39;s great, you
            have a proper dream.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe was surprised, but he was inspired and praised Kitou who had firmer
            thinking
            than himself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Children grow old whether they like it or not, and have to become a part of
            society.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s the same for Watanabe, who doesn&#39;t have a goal, and Ryuen, who
            doesn&#39;t talk about it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Umm, I don&#39;t know why I asked, but... I don&#39;t know what to say now
            that
            I know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe muttered in a bitter voice as he turned to the ceiling. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re all in different classes here, aren&#39;t we? So, normally, only
            one
            out of four students can graduate in A class. I&#39;m assuming you have a dream you want to
            achieve, but if
            you take that seat, someone else can&#39;t... it&#39;s complicated.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Classmates can share their dreams with each other. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But you can&#39;t share your dreams with your rivals. That&#39;s how this school
            works. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some laugh, others weep. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I wonder if spending an evening with other students of the same age would lead to
            this kind of conversation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a night that reminded me of the time I spent talking with Keisei and the
            others at last year&#39;s training camp.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c11"><span class="c1"></span></p>
