    <h3>Part 4</h3><p>
In the end, I returned to my dorm that day without buying a cake. 

</p><p>After that, I went online to study about the New Year’s celebration to clear my mind because I didn’t think too much about it last year, and I still have some regrets. 

</p><p>It might be nice to do something like that at the beginning of the New Year. 

</p><p>I didn’t even get a rice cake to celebrate the New Year when I was in the White Room. 

</p><p>It was around 8 p.m. when I finished dinner while doing research.

</p><p>I was thinking about taking a bath when I received a phone call.

</p><p>“Good evening, Ayanokouji-kun.”

</p><p>“I didn’t expect to get a call from you at this kind of hour, Sakayanagi.”

</p><p>“I just wanted to check in with you.”

</p><p>“Just so you know, I haven’t become an unfortunate person.”

</p><p>I replied in a preemptive manner as a joke.

</p><p>“Hehe, I bet. You’re definitely not an unfortunate person.” 

</p><p>Judging from her reaction, however, was that actually her aim as well?

</p><p>“I’ll save it for next year.”

</p><p>I’m not a sore loser, so I honestly conveyed my positive attitude.

</p><p>“I see.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi laughed with joy on the other side of the phone.

</p><p>“I’m going to change the subject, but has Karuizawa-san’s condition gotten any better?”

</p><p>“It looks like her fever has gone down. She just needs to be patient for two more days.”

</p><p>Even if her fever has gone down, the rule is that she has to stay in her room for two more days after that.

</p><p>“I see, that’s convenient for me. Can we make an appointment from now, then?”

</p><p>“From now? It’s not really a problem, but what is it about?”

</p><p>“I’ll save that for when we meet. May I visit you in your room?”

</p><p>“You want to come to my room?”

</p><p>“Is it too sudden?”

</p><p>“No, not really.”

</p><p>“I’ll come over, then.”

</p><p>She immediately hung up the phone after that answer.

</p><p>The call ended rather chaotically before I had any time to think, and I heard a gentle knock at the door.

</p><p>“I see.”

</p><p>I got up and went to the front door, and found the caller, Sakayanagi.

</p><p>“Did you go somewhere?”

</p><p>She looks very well dressed for someone who just came from her own room. 

</p><p>She was wearing a hat with a little bit of snow on it. 

</p><p>“Merry Christmas. Here’s Santa.” 

</p><p>When we met eyes, she held out a small box in one hand and held it up in front of me. 

</p><p>I accepted the box and nodded in satisfaction.

</p><p>But, calling herself Santa is a bit…

“It’s already the night of the 26th. This is a pretty late entrance for Santa Claus.” 

</p><p>“The model for Santa Claus is St. Nicholas. It is said that he used to live in the region on the southern coast of Turkey. I rode on a sleigh to Japan after I finished distributing presents, so it’s no wonder I’m a little late.”

</p><p>I’m not sure if she’s being stupidly serious, or joking around in contrast, but that was her reply.

</p><p>“I think you can tell already, but I brought you a christmas cake. I’m calling myself Santa, so I just want you to accept the present.” 

</p><p>“Well, I thought that’s what it was from looking at the box, but I feel a strong sense of déja-vu.” 

</p><p>Could it be that Sakayanagi was planning for this moment again from that time?

</p><p>“Yes, that’s precisely the reason. I promised that I’d bring you a different cake, did I not?” 

</p><p>It’s true, she saw that I didn’t show much liking for the mont blanc, and said that she would make up for it later…

“It’s not a coincidence that it’s today, is it?”

</p><p>“Of course not. You wanted to eat a cake, so I thought this was a great opportunity. It’s also why I didn’t recommend you to get a cake from a convenience store.”

</p><p>“So that’s why you forced me away from that.”

</p><p>“Yes. Everything’s gone according to my strategy.”

</p><p>If I had stopped by a convenience store and decided to eat a cake, I doubt I would be able to enjoy the one Sakayanagi brought to me.

</p><p>“It seems you had to spend Christmmas alone, so I came to rescue you.”

</p><p>“Are you sure it’s okay for the leader of A Class to roll into a boy’s room in the middle of the night like this?”

</p><p>“You’re the one that’s going to be in trouble if it gets out, so I don’t mind.”

</p><p>I can’t deny that. I would be the one showered in criticism if I said that Sakayanagi barged in uninvited.

</p><p>“Also, it’s only 8:00 p.m., which isn’t a surprising hour during the winter vacation, is it?”

</p><p>“I guess not.”

</p><p>“I see you’re using your room as neatly as ever. I’m impressed. I’ve visited several girls’ rooms, but I’ve never seen anyone who keeps it this clean.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi asked me for permission after praising me and sat down on the bed.

</p><p>Then, she took off her coat.

</p><p>“What were you going to do if you couldn’t see me today?” 

</p><p>I could have been sleeping, out somewhere, or many other things. 

</p><p>“I was going to intrude at a time unrelated to Christmas.” 

</p><p>So it’s just a coincidence that she did it today?

</p><p>She also seems to have thought about Karuizawa.

</p><p>“I think you can tell already, but I’ve provided two cakes.”

</p><p>The box indeed didn’t feel like just one cake when I received it.

</p><p>She seems to be planning to eat it here with me before leaving.

</p><p>“I’ll get you something to drink, then. Same as last time?”

</p><p>“I’ll be waiting, thank you.”

</p><p>I went to the kitchen to prepare the coffee I brewed beforehand.

</p><p>“You’re starting to look better and better in the kitchen.”

</p><p>“I’ve been having a lot more chances to cook since I started living in a dorm.”

</p><p>“It all depends on your attitude, doesn’t it? You can eat from convenience stores or the school cafeteria, even if you don’t have money.”

</p><p>“...Maybe. I guess it’s just that I simply want to cook.”

</p><p>“It would be unthinkable in the White Room, right? It’s sad, though. Even if you become a pro-class cook, you’re not gonna have any chances to utilize that after graduation.” 

</p><p>It was the same in Keyaki Mall too, but she’s talking a lot about that subject today.

</p><p>“Are you trying to look into me? I don’t think you know all of the circumstances of the White Room. It’s hard to believe that even Chairman Sakayanagi would reveal such things to his daughter.”

</p><p>I can’t see Sakayanagi’s expression since I have my back turned to her, but I’m sure she’s smiling.

</p><p>“It’s true that what I’m saying is only in the realm of imagination. As you say, I don’t know the details about the White Room. Still, I make some pretty good guesses about it, don’t I?”

</p><p>“Yeah. After I graduate, or get expelled, I’m probably going to be brought back to the White Room and put in a leadership position and train others until I am no longer needed.”

</p><p>Just a while ago, there would have been no doubt about that.

</p><p>Now, however, I have some doubts, even if slight ones, about what’s going to happen.

</p><p>There are advantages and disadvantages to being sent to this school for three years. 

</p><p>There is inevitably an irrational aspect when you weigh them. 

</p><p>Of course, I don’t know what’s going on outside. 

</p><p>That man says the White Room is active again, but since I don’t know what the real situation is, there is no way for me to confirm whether this is true or not.

</p><p>I brought two thin plates along with the coffee for the cakes.

</p><p>“By the way, should I be getting excited about the cake?”

</p><p>“I don’t know what you like, so if this one is no good, then I’ll just have to try again next time. In fact, that may actually be the better outcome, since I can make up for it later.”

</p><p>I didn’t expect her to say that she’d be happy even if I didn’t like the cake.

</p><p>I might need to tell her that I like it, even if I have to lie.

</p><p>“I’m confident that I can see through you if you try to act.”

</p><p>“Stop reading me.”

</p><p>“I like that your daily thought process is easy to understand. It’s very simple and clear.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi knows that this is only my second year as an ordinary student here, and that I’m still inexperienced.  

</p><p>She seems to have calculated and taken into account the influence I’m receiving from my school life and other external factors.

</p><p>I opened the box to find two shortcakes side by side.

</p><p>“Where did you get these? You didn’t prepare them in advance, did you?”

</p><p>The box also has something that looks like a manufacturer’s logo on it.

</p><p>It’s not something that you would normally find in a convenience store or a supermarket.

</p><p>“There’s somewhat of a unique story behind this. I was going to buy some sweets from a convenience store and visit you after, but I saw my classmate Sawada-san on the way, who was returning from Keyaki Mall. She told me that the cakes she ordered from a famous cake store were delayed because of the snow and just arrived today. It looks like Sawada gave up and just ate a bunch of cakes during Christmas, though, and was wondering what to do while bringing them home.”

</p><p>“You’re saying you stole some delicious cake from Sawada?”

</p><p>Still, I guess a coincidence like that could happen.

</p><p>No, this is Sakayanagi. 

</p><p>It’s possible that she may have known this information in advance.

</p><p>It would be pointless to pursue this point, though.

</p><p>“I did pay with private points, so don’t worry. I don’t know whether Sawakawa-san was going to eat these two cakes alone or with someone in particular, though.” 

</p><p>There’s probably a lot more students than we know who are secretly harbouring love for someone.

</p><p>Then, I decided to eat the cake I got from Sakayanagi.

</p><p>I’ve had shortcake several times, but this was claimed to be from a famous store, and I can sense the difference from the cream. It’s much tastier than the mont blanc from last time.

</p><p>“Looks like you like it.”

</p><p>“I haven’t said anything yet.”

</p><p>I feel that I’ve been exposed, but I took a second bite with my unstoppable hand.

</p><p>“You don’t have to say anything. It’s not something I chose, though, so I do have mixed feelings about this.” 

</p><p>Sakayanagi then put some cake into her mouth and nodded with satisfaction.

</p><p>“The taste certainly is outstanding, though.”

</p><p>Sakayanagi seemed happy after showing acceptance of what she had to accept.

</p><p>We finished eating our cakes without any further talking and caught our breaths.

</p><p>It was almost 9 o’clock when she then made the following request :

</p><p>“Shall we take just a little walk outside now?”

</p><p>“Outside?”

</p><p>I can say no, but all I’m going to do after this is take a bath and go to sleep.

</p><p>Before that, a walk on a snowy road, which is something I’ve had limited opportunity to experience, isn’t such a bad idea.

</p><p>“It might be nice.”

</p><p>There’s no particular reason to refuse, so I decided to accept her proposal.

</p><p>“I’ll be waiting for you at the lobby, then.” 

</p><p>Taking into consideration that I would need to change clothes, Sakayanagi stood up with her cane. 

</p><p>I should get ready and go after her, then.
