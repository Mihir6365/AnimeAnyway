    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>

        The snowfall has started slowing down, and the snow on the ground is melting while leaving behind patterns.

    </p>
    <p>Some snow still remains in the shade, but it's only a matter of time now until it's all gone.

    </p>
    <p>Still, a call from Ryuen, at the end of the year? We had some strategic interactions at the school festival, and
        we happened to be in the same group on the school trip, but we had no particular involvement with each other
        after that.

    </p>
    <p>It’s unlikely he wants to talk about anything related to the tests, as we’re currently in winter break.

    </p>
    <p>I arrived at the north entrance of Keyaki Mall at almost exactly the appointed time, not even knowing what kind
        of business he had with me.

    </p>
    <p>It wasn’t Ryuen there, but instead someone else waiting with their back towards me and crossed arms.

    </p>
    <p>“Katsuragi? I guess this isn’t a coincidence, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Keyaki Mall isn’t open yet.

    </p>
    <p>There’s no reason for someone to try and get into a store first right now, so I don’t know why he would be here
        at this time.

    </p>
    <p>“Ryuen called you here, didn’t you? Same thing here.”

    </p>
    <p>If he called Katsuragi as well, then it doesn’t sound like this is going to be simple chit-chat.

    </p>
    <p>“He always calls people suddenly like this. It’s a bad habit of his.”

    </p>
    <p>Since he moved from A Class to Ryuen class, Katsuragi has been working with Ryuen in many scenarios.

    </p>
    <p>“You're a great adviser. It looks like Ryuen also has a lot of confidence in you, Katsuragi.”

    </p>
    <p>“I hope so.”

    </p>
    <p>He didn’t react in a happy way, but he doesn’t seem all too dissatisfied to hear that.

    </p>
    <p>“So, what’s the reason for the call?”

    </p>
    <p>“Who knows? Ask that directly to Ryuen.”

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi, who must have been called in the same way as I was, was apparently not told why Ryuen called us here.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s gotta be some wicked plan. I’m sure you can guess that much, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I know that this has the potential of being troublesome.”

    </p>
    <p>“Why didn’t you just ignore him, then?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’d be a lot more annoying for me later, wouldn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s only for normal students. He mentions your name from time to time, but only in remarks with great
        compliments. It's proof that he understands he’s currently no match for you.”

    </p>
    <p>“Compliments..? I can’t even imagine that.”

    </p>
    <p>“ ‘I’ll make him disappear.’ ‘I’ll crush him.’ ‘I’ll kill him.’ All impressive compliments, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Those aren’t compliments, they’re tragedies.”

    </p>
    <p>Maybe he was messing with me a little, as the corners of his mouth are turning up slightly.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no one outside the class with whom he can talk on an equal or greater level, or honestly. In that sense,
        your presence is very important for that man.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi would be fine in terms of someone being more than equal with him, but I’m the enemy right before his
        eyes.

    </p>
    <p>It has nothing to do with talking to each other honestly.

    </p>
    <p>“Still, the special test did have some beneficial elements for you, but I’m surprised you defeated Sakayanagi. I
        hope this breaks up the calculations a little bit.”

    </p>
    <p>“Sakayanagi did everything she could, so the impact of her defeat should be limited. We also won simply because a
        lot of various things aligned for us and we just went with the flow.”

    </p>
    <p>“Went with the flow, huh? It was still a special test where you couldn’t ever win if you didn’t have the true
        ability, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi commended me, saying that the reason for our victory is beyond doubt the class’ ability.

    </p>
    <p>“You created quite the gap between the Ichinose Class and yours, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“That class is very positive about all the special tests, and they’re very faithful to the basics. Besides, the
        class’ command is in trouble.”

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi analyzed that this is not an opponent who can be easily defeated.

    </p>
    <p>“Our class’ problem is obvious. We are far behind the other classes in academic ability. I’m sure we will have to
        fight a lot more battles against the odds if we don’t do something about it.”

    </p>
    <p>The issues are obvious, but fixing them will be extremely difficult.

    </p>
    <p>Academic ability is not something you can acquire in one night and morning.

    </p>
    <p>“In the earlier special test, I told Ryuen to give up on quick gain and raise the academic level of the entire
        class, but he seemed unwilling to listen to me.”

    </p>
    <p>If one can’t win by a frontal attack, they have a tendency to resort to subterfuge and surprise attacks.

    </p>
    <p>“However, this isn’t going to lead to a solution if the situation is left unresolved. Humans are interesting;
        they're unconsciously selective in who they associate with. Ryuen uses everyone in the class as his hands and
        feet, but there are still inevitably some students who are useful, and some that he will rarely use.”

    </p>
    <p>“It's not just a matter of difference in abilities?”

    </p>
    <p>If there are students like Ishizaki and Albert, who are obedient and relatively capable of doing bad deeds, it is
        only natural that Ryuen would inevitably favour them over students who are rebellious and dislike doing bad
        things.

    </p>
    <p>“Yes. You can tell the difference even without regard to their abilities. Isn't it strange?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah.”

    </p>
    <p>“So, when I have extra time, I’m teaching the relatively underutilized students how to think, and how to study
        proactively. In secret to him, of course.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen would probably scold Katsuragi for doing such unnecessary things if he heard about this.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t think he will actually stop Katsuragi, though, even if he appears angry on the surface.

    </p>
    <p>After all, the Ryuen who has grown up to this point would decide that this is a necessary measure.

    </p>
    <p>He spent a lot of money bringing in Katsuragi to find methods that he cannot do himself, after all.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you sure it’s okay to let me hear about such important things?”

    </p>
    <p>“This is strange too, but sometimes, it’s easier on your mind to tell your secrets to someone.”

    </p>
    <p>“What if I told Ryuen about it?”

    </p>
    <p>“If you’re that kind of person, I’d just reconsider my choices for miscalculating your character.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s a roundabout way of saying he trusts me.

    </p>
    <p>I’m under a lot of pressure not to betray him now.

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi then interrupted our conversation and looked behind me.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s the impudent man. He doesn’t seem to be sorry for being late.”

    </p>
    <p>I followed Katsuragi’s gaze, who took his back off the wall with dismay, and saw Ryuen walking towards us.

    </p>
    <p>I suppose he stopped by a convenience store, as there is a plastic bag wrapped around his left wrist.

    </p>
    <p>“Looks like you’re both here.”

    </p>
    <p>“I think you should give an apology to Ayanokoji, no?”

    </p>
    <p>“Who gives a shit? Just be grateful I didn’t call you on New Year’s Day.”

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi encouraged Ryuen to apologize, and he obviously ignored it.

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi and I looked at each other for a moment, telling each other not to bother.

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen then took out a hamburger from the bag and put the empty bag into his pocket.
    </p>

<p>
Perhaps not having eaten breakfast, he ripped the wrapping paper open and started eating. 

</p><p>Katsuragi looked at him with a dumbfounded look, wondering why he didn’t eat before coming here. 

</p><p>“Let’s hear why you called me and Ayanokoji here.” 

</p><p>He asked in a strong tone of voice, but Ryuen continued chewing without a reply. 

</p><p>He continued this for a while, and started speaking when his stomach was satisfied.

</p><p>“I heard an interesting story from the third years, and I thought I’d share it with you. Apparently, there’s a big mountain we’re going to crash into in the same year in the third term.”

</p><p>“A big mountain? You mean the final tests, right? That’s nothing surprising.” 

</p><p>The fact that the final tests will be extremely tough has already been confirmed in several ways. 

</p><p>I don’t think Ryuen called us here to tell us such an obvious thing. 

</p><p>“Maybe it’s not limited to just the final test?”

</p><p>After a moment, I stepped in after Katsuragi’s reply.

</p><p>“We’re focusing on the third term’s end, but that may not be the right thing to do.” 

</p><p>“Ayanokoji. Did you hear something too, you bastard?”

</p><p>“I heard there may be a special test at the beginning of the third semester, which could result in some students being expelled. I’m not sure how reliable it is, though.”

</p><p>Ryuen, perhaps having heard the same thing too, smiled.

</p><p>“By the way, when did you hear about it?” 

</p><p>“Three days ago, on December 25. I heard it from Kiryuuin of Year Three B Class.” 

</p><p>“Same day as me. I heard it from some guy called Momiyama from Year Three D Class.”

</p><p>“If it really is a risky test, and both Ryuen and you heard about it at pretty much the same time… Why?” 

</p><p>“It could just be a coincidence, or…”

</p><p>“Maybe the school is intentionally controlling things in order to leak information at this time.” 

</p><p>Ryuen bit down on his hamburger as he seemed to be more and more convinced. Horikita B Class heard it from Kiryuuin B Class. 

</p><p>Ryuen D Class heard it from Momiyama D Class. It’s interesting that the class rankings of the sources are the same. 

</p><p>If Sakayanagi heard it from A Class, and Ichinose heard it from C Class, then my insight is correct. 

</p><p>“However, can we really be so sure? Maybe someone is working with the Year Three students to spread rumours? After all, we’re right in the middle of winter break right now.”

</p><p>“Heh. That’s why it’s so credible.”

</p><p>We are in the middle of our vacation, so there is of course not much tension among the students. 

</p><p>They’re having a good time in a relaxed mood. If this is a false rumor, it will make the students get ready for war earlier, but it won’t have much of an effect other than that. I can’t expect it to cause much psychological anxiety.

</p><p>“It’s a warning to get ready for a shock. It’s more natural to think of it that way.”

</p><p>Katsuragi calmly analyzed the situation which Ryuen and I both had an understanding of.

</p><p>The message has a clean flow if it was from a third year student.

</p><p>“Has anyone else heard something similar?”

</p><p>I turned my head to the left and right in response to Katsuragi’s question, and Ryuen didn’t give an answer, but I suppose that was his reply.

</p><p>Ishizaki and the others would have immediately reported it to Ryuen if they had heard about it. 

</p><p>“One representative from each class has been notified… I think.”

</p><p>“I suppose we can’t get any conclusive evidence, but I think it’s probably reached Sakayanagi or Ichinose too. No matter how indirect the information is, no one would be stupid enough to miss it.” 

</p><p>“In that case though, there’s a question on my mind. Why did they choose you from Year Two B Class, Ayanokoji? If we think in order, shouldn’t it have been Horikita? Maybe Ryuen was chosen just by coincidence, and Sakayanaki or Ichinose was also… No, that’s hard to believe.” 

</p><p>Katsuragi was about to come up with a new hypothesis, but he dismissed it on the way.

</p><p>“The school is neutral to the end. If they’re going to give warnings, they would have made sure that only the leaders can get prepared beforehand. At the very least, they have to choose someone who can receive and understand a warning from a Year Three student.” 

</p><p>“Suzune is pretty strong too, but it’s not hard to believe that the school or the Year Three guys consider Ayanokoji as the leader. It’s nothing really to be surprised about.”

</p><p>Indeed, I’ve had many opportunities recently to talk with both Nagumo and Kiriyama up close, even in relation to the student council. 

</p><p>However, Kiriyama would still firmly choose Horikita. 

</p><p>Above all, this doesn’t help solve the question of Kiryuuin’s contact with me. 

</p><p>If I was forced to make an explanation, I would say that the Year Three leaders were instructed by the school to deliver a message to the Year Two leaders. 

</p><p>Kiriyama intended to tell Horikita, but Kiryuuin overheard it and contacted me on her own.

</p><p>I don’t know whether this interpretation is correct or not, but since I know the contents of the message, it has become necessary and obligatory for me to notify Horikita.

</p><p>“If I assume that the same thing happened last year too, then it’s possible the special test suggested here could be held around the mixed training camp.”

</p><p>Katsuragi put his scattered words together again and organized them.

</p><p>“There will be two special tests held in the third semester from early January to Late January, and one in early March when the special tests are voted on by the class. After that, it would be the fourth and final test.”

</p><p>So, in addition to the three tests in the first year, there will be 4 in total in the second year.

</p><p>However, we shouldn’t forget that this is all speculation. 

</p><p>The in-class vote was apparently an unscheduled event that doesn’t happen every year. 

</p><p>If it isn’t going to happen, then there would be a total of three special tests in the third term. 

</p><p>After all, last year is last year. 

</p><p>With exaggeration, it is possible that there won’t actually be any special tests until the end of the year except the written test, and there is also no guarantee that there won’t be a large number of special tests, like five or six instead of four.

</p><p>“In-class voting, huh? Sakayanagi made you expel Totsuka, right?” 

</p><p>“Yeah.”

</p><p>Remembering last year’s bitter events, Katsuragi’s expression clouded a little.

</p><p>Ryuen finished eating his hamburger and gleefully continued after Katsuragi. 

</p><p>“Depending on the situation, it may not end with just one or two expulsions.” 

</p><p>We should consider that this is actually a reasonable risk. 

</p><p>“Expulsions, huh? I’d like to avoid that if possible.” 

</p><p>“Heheh, don’t be so soft. There’s still way too many students in our year. It’s not gonna be any fun without a special test that can cull 5 or even 10 students, right?” 

</p><p>Katsuragi is concerned about his classmates, but Ryuen has the opposite thought. 

</p><p>“Don’t forget that there’s a risk of you becoming a target too, Ryuen.” 

</p><p>“Bring it. Whether it’s Sakayanagi, or Ichinose, I’m just gonna smash anyone who messes with me.” 

</p><p>“That’s if you know who your enemy is. There may be someone from the inside who tries to kick you down.” 

</p><p>The inside, in other words, the class he is based in. 

</p><p>Ryuen always creates enemies, so I’m sure he has a lot of them.

</p><p>Well, he’s not the kind of man who would be worried about that.

</p><p>“It’s gonna be pretty simple if we don’t have to choose who to cut.” 

</p><p>“Come on… Let me say this, I’m gonna oppose you if you try to abandon your allies.” 

</p><p>“Whatever.”

</p><p>I don’t expect Ryuen to show any mercy if Katsuragi gets in his way, but Katsuragi will still function as a stopper to some extent. 

</p><p>However, there’s still an unanswered point.

</p><p>Katsuragi’s expression is very stiff while walking next to me, so he must have the same feeling.

</p><p>If the only purpose of this meeting is to discuss the hard special test that seems to be approaching us, there would be no need for the three of us to gather like this to talk about it. 

</p><p>“The next special test. Supposing that the rules let us fight one on one, I’m going to eat Sakayanagi alive.” 

</p><p>He must be hiding the real issue at hand.

</p><p>Ryuen talked as if he was seeing through our thoughts.

</p><p>“What are you trying to do here ,Ryuen? Isn’t a direct confrontation at the final test enough for you?”

</p><p>“It ain’t. I wanna see that girl’s face painted in disgrace as many times as I can.”

</p><p>He’s saying that I shouldn’t mess with them if we can pick who we fight.

</p><p>“I doubt Horikita would voluntarily want to confront the Sakayanagi Class, so you don’t need to warn her. As things currently are, unless it’s a special test with a heavy emphasis on teamwork, there’s no advantage for her to fight the Sakayanagi Class, which is above hers in total power.” 

</p><p>If she had to compare the Sakayanagi class and the class which is currently in the bottom, she would probably choose Ichinose.

</p><p>“I can’t say that it’s a good idea to choose the A Class as your opponent at this point. They might be the strongest enemy there is if the special test is based on academic ability like last time.” 

</p><p>Indeed, there’s certainly no need to go out of one’s way to choose them at this stage.

</p><p>However, Ryuen seemed to be willing to take the risk and fight.

</p><p>“I’m sure Sakayanagi thinks I’m someone who she can beat any time. I’m gonna knock that naive idea out of her.” 

</p><p>“...I don’t want to endorse this.” 

</p><p>“Do you want to choose Ichinose then, Katsuragi? Ichinose would be a pretty troubling foe.” 

</p><p>It looks like Ryuen has also noticed that Ichinose has started changing in a big way. 

</p><p>Katsuragi also needs to recognize this point again, but he still disapproves of naming Sakayanagi.

</p><p>“It’s okay to evaluate Ichinose as troubling. However, the overall advantage still goes to Sakayanagi. Even if she were to overturn our previous evaluations, I don’t think Ichinose can be above Sakayanagi. For now, we should just enter the third term and wait for the information to be publicized.”

</p><p>Katsuragi isn’t looking down on Ichinose, but he proposed that they should wait until they know the contents of the special test to choose their foe. 

</p><p>“It doesn’t matter why, does it? I’m sure Ryuen just wants to fight Sakayanagi.” 

</p><p>“That’s why I’m worried. A leader should at least choose the path that has a higher chance of victory. Deciding to fight the stronger enemy is the same as abandoning our own victory.”

</p><p>We continued walking around Keyaki Mall without stopping while talking to each other.

</p><p>It doesn’t look like I’m going to be released for a while.
