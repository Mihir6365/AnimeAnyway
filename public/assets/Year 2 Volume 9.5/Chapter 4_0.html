    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
    <h2>Quiet Stirrings</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        The morning of December 28 as the new year approaches.

    </p>
    <p>I looked at my phone by my pillow and I saw that I had received a message around 7:00, about 30 minutes before
        now.

    </p>
    <p>It was a reserved message from Kei telling me that she was feeling better.

    </p>
    <p>I was lying back looking at my phone, then I turned around and laid face-down looking at my phone.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you awake?”

    </p>
    <p>I sent her this message, and it was read in less than three seconds.

    </p>
    <p>She was holding her phone and waiting for my reply.

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm, I’m awake.”

    </p>
    <p>I have contacted her a few times to check on her condition since she had influenza, but that’s it.

    </p>
    <p>I’m not sure if it’s because she was just sick, or if it’s because of the distance between us, but her text
        messages aren’t excited like always and she isn’t sending any stamps.

    </p>
    <p>“What are your plans for today?”

    </p>
    <p>I replied to her.

    </p>
    <p>I was going to ask her out if she answered that she was free, but…
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sorry. I’m gonna hang out with Maya-chan after this to thank her for all the support she’s given me. Is that a
        problem?”
    </p>
    <p>Of course not. It’s a very important thing that should be prioritized.

    </p>
    <p>If she puts me first and disrespects Satou, there will never be a true friendship established between them.

    </p>
    <p>Naturally, I won’t do anything to put a damper on this matter. That’s not what I want.

    </p>
    <p>“Okay. Can I call you tonight then? Around 9:00? I want to talk about what we’re going to do tomorrow and after.”

    </p>
    <p>Like Christmas, which we had planned on spending together, or the distance that’s been opening between us
        recently.

    </p>
    <p>As boyfriend and girlfriend, there are many things we have to talk about face to face.

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm.”

    </p>
    <p>Then, a quick and short answer came back right away.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll wait for your call, then.”

    </p>
    <p>For now, I’m just glad that she’s feeling better.

    </p>
    <p>It’s also great that we made a plan within this year.

    </p>
    <p>Now, it’s just a matter of how to spend my day.

    </p>
    <p>I’m not sure if I will be going to the gym for the first time in a few days, or if I’m going to spend the day in
        my room.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t want to create a situation where I clash with the time Kei and Satou are going to spend together.

    </p>
    <p>So, the gym option crossed my mind, and disappeared right away.

    </p>
    <p>At the same time, the option of Keyaki Mall also disappeared.

    </p>
    <p>Kei and Satou aren’t going to have any fun if they notice my presence and get bothered by it.

    </p>
    <p>As such, I took my phone to tell her that I will be spending the day in my room, and I heard a sound.

    </p>
    <p>I thought it might be Kei, but the number was unfortunately unregistered.

    </p>
    <p>However, I remember this number.

    </p>
    <p>What now? I stared at the display for a while.

    </p>
    <p>I wondered how long it would ring, but it didn’t stop, so I decided to answer it.

    </p>
    <p>“Pick up the damn phone.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen complained before I could even answer.

    </p>
    <p>“I was in the toilet.”

    </p>
    <p>“Really? Maybe you were just waiting until the ringing stopped?”

    </p>
    <p>Impressive. It looks like both Sakayanagi and Ryuen can read my daily thinking patterns very well.

    </p>
    <p>“Hang with me for a bit later. I’ll be at the north entrance of Keyaki Mall in 30 minutes.”

    </p>
    <p>He simply told me what to do without showing any interest in a possible excuse I might have.

    </p>
    <p>“Aren’t you going to check my plans? I have a tight schedule.”

    </p>
    <p>“Postpone it.”

    </p>
    <p>He hung up the phone after making his demand.

    </p>
    <p>“Selfish as usual.”
    </p>
    <p></p>
