        However, Hiyori hurriedly followed after me not long after I stepped out into the hallway.

    </p>
    <p>It was only a short distance away, but she was still slightly out of breath.

    </p>
    <p>“Here…”

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori showed me a paper bag after she regained her breathing.

    </p>
    <p>Regardless of these turn of events, I can already tell that it’s a book from the bag’s shape.

    </p>
    <p>However, I don’t think it’s something from the library.

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori took it out with her thin fingers and offered it to me.

“This is my favourite book, so I’d really like it if you read it.” 

</p><p>It has a cover, but I already have an idea of what it is. 

</p><p>“Is it a book by the author you mentioned earlier?” 

</p><p>“I guess it was obvious, huh?” 

</p><p>A book by an unknown author suddenly offered to me regardless of the genre. It was relatively easy to guess. 

</p><p>“I was worried that I couldn’t give it to you as a present if you had already read it.” 

</p><p>Being gifted a book you’ve read, and a book you haven’t read give one different degrees of joy.

</p><p>I think that’s why she asked me if I read it. 

</p><p>“If you just want to read something, you can borrow it from the library. But if I really like a book, then I want to keep it with me.”

</p><p>“Is that why you paid for it and purchased it yourself?” 

</p><p>“That, and… They don’t have his book in the library.” 

</p><p>So she couldn’t loan it even if she wanted to. 

</p><p>She could ask the librarian to stock it, but from looking at Hiyori, it seems like this book isn’t something that would be popular with everyone.

</p><p>I wonder if she thinks that it’s not good enough to be popular even if she likes it?

</p><p>“Can I really take this?” 

</p><p>Even if it’s just one book, this kind of paperback isn’t cheap for a student. 

</p><p>“Yes. Actually, this is the third time I’ve bought this book. I bought the first one when I was in middle school, and it’s still in my room. I bought the second one right after enrolling in this school.”

</p><p>So she bought the third one as a present for me. 

</p><p>“I think I mostly know what you like, so I’m confident you’ll be happy with it.”

</p><p> “Sorry for the trouble.”

</p><p>I can’t make her keep holding it in the air forever, so I took it from her hand.

</p><p>However, there’s now a question on my mind. 

</p><p>“Have you been walking around with it all this time until you saw me?”

</p><p>That’s almost a certainty, since I didn’t tell Hiyori that I was coming here today.

</p><p>“I’d come and meet you right away if you told me.” 

</p><p>“Well, yes. But… It was only a few days, so it’s not a problem.” 

</p><p>“I’ll see you later, then.”

</p><p>I feel like she looked a little regretful, but it’s probably just me.
