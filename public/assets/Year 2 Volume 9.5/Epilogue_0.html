    <h1>Epilogue</h1>
    <h2>Changing Relationships</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3><p>
There are only two days left of our winter break. 

</p><p>My relationship with Kei has been restored, and things are back to how they were before - no, better than before from Kei’s viewpoint.

</p><p>Sudou used to hate Yousuke in a one-sided way at the start, but I’ve seen that there’s been a positive change on that matter, and I’ve had unexpected encounters with Sakayanagi and her classmates. 

</p><p>Furthermore, Ryuuen and Katsuragi have already started preparing for the start of the third term, and Ichinose’s mental stability is starting to change, which is good news for her anxious class. 

</p><p>It would be safe to conclude that the winter break was generally satisfying. 
</p><p>There is just one point. 

</p><p>The book that Hiyori gave me. 

</p><p>What can I do for her in return? 

</p><p>I came to a conclusion after thinking about it for a few days, but I needed to make some preparations in advance. 

</p><p>I just caused a lot of anxiety because of Ichinose.

</p><p>I don’t want to rekindle that kind of strange atmosphere here.

</p><p>I must repay her in a gentle manner without causing any misunderstandings. 

</p><p>How can I repay her? 

</p><p>There’s a hint in my mind from the past shortly after I entered the school.

</p><p>“Kiyotaka This is just for today, okay!?” 

</p><p>Kei muttered so while hugging me from the back before I left the room, still in her pajamas. 

</p><p>“I know. That’s why I made sure to tell you, didn’t I?” 

</p><p>“I know, and I understand the reason, but… I’m still worried!” 

</p><p>She turned around after I lightly pushed her away and hugged me from the front this time. 

</p><p>“Come back before night, okay?” 

</p><p>“If you were so worried about it, why didn’t you agree to the conditions I put out?”

</p><p>“I could never do that. I have a hard enough time reading textbooks. Besides, we’d never come to an agreement.” 

</p><p>Well, she’s right about that. 

</p><p>Forcing them together probably wouldn’t lead to any pleasing result for either of them. 

</p><p>“Kiss me, then!” 

</p><p>“Where did the ‘then’ come from?” 

</p><p>Kei had already closed her eyes and turned her lips towards me when I asked. 

</p><p>I did as she wanted, and she giggled and waved her hand in a cute way. 

</p><p>“See you soon.” 

</p><p>She’s smiling happily, as if she wasn’t so angry just five seconds ago. Kei saw me off like that and I left the room.
