    <h3>Part 2</h3><p>
There was supposed to be a large Christmas tree displayed at the main entrance.

</p><p>Karuizawa had a melancholic expression as she stared at the empty space where it should have been.

</p><p>“Haah…” 

</p><p>A heavy sigh came out of her mouth.  Satou, who had just arrived at the meeting place, heard it from behind Karuizawa. 

</p><p>“Kei-chan, did you have to wait?”

</p><p>“Ah, Maya-chan. Not at all, I just got here.” 

</p><p>Karuizawa completely recovered on the 28th and invited Satou to hang out with her. 

</p><p>As she also explained to Ayanokoji, Satou had helped her time and time again while she had influenza. 

</p><p>If there was anything she needed or lacked, Satou would give it to her regardless of the time. 

</p><p>When she was lonely, Satou would immediately return her messages. 

</p><p>She accepted her painful feelings that she wanted to send to Ayanokoji, but could not. 

</p><p>Then, when Karuizawa invited her out, Satou readily accepted without a trace of hesitation. 

</p><p>“I’m sorry I invited you so suddenly.” 

</p><p>“It’s not a problem. I’m just glad you recovered. I really am.” 

</p><p>“Thanks. Influenza isn’t that big of a deal though, is it?” 

</p><p>“There are some people who get really badly sick because of it.” 

</p><p>Relieved that Karuizawa had recovered, Satou took Karuizawa’s hand like a happy child. 

</p><p>“This may be unnecessary, but… you let Ayanokoji-kun know too, right? That you’re recovered?” 

</p><p>“Mhm, I told him in the morning. We’re gonna talk about the promise we couldn’t fulfill on Christmas tonight.” 

</p><p>“I see! That’s great!”

</p><p>With this, Satou was quickly convinced that everything would turn out to be fine, but her smile quickly faded when she saw that Karuizawa didn’t look so happy.

</p><p>“We might be able to make good on our promise to meet up, but, I’m not sure what’s going to happen after…” 

</p><p>“N-Not sure? But… You just had a little fight, didn’t you?” 

</p><p>From what Satou had heard, it wasn’t as deep of a problem as Karuizawa made it seem to be. 

</p><p>Most of all, it was Ayanokoji who was at fault.

</p><p>However, there was a different problem which kept coming and going from Karuizawa’s mind. 

</p><p>“I think that Ayanokoji might be falling in love with Ichinose.” 

</p><p>Falling in love with someone else. 

</p><p>This is the awful development that Karuizawa was constantly thinking about while she was sick. 

</p><p>“No, no, no! There’s no way! It’s going to be alright, okay?”

</p><p>“...Mhm.”

</p><p>Karuizawa responded smoothly, and it was a relief for Satou to see that her words had been well received.

</p><p>After that, Satou regretted bringing up this subject and desperately tried to change the topic.

</p><p>“The N-New Year’s is almost here already, huh? A year passes by so fast!”

</p><p>The Christmas Tree which was taken down. 

</p><p>The surroundings are already moving towards the New Year.

</p><p>“Mhm, it does… I wanted to see the Christmas Tree.” 

</p><p>“Uh!?”

</p><p>Karuizawa still had lingering regrets in her mind and gazed at the spot without moving.

</p><p>She was supposed to have a date with Ayanokoji on the 24th and take photos with the Christmas Tree still up and glittering with decorations. 

</p><p>Trying not to dig herself in even deeper, Satou pulled on her cheeks. 

</p><p>“T-There’s still next year, right?” “Yeah… I guess so.”

</p><p>Next year. 

</p><p>Karuizawa couldn’t think about one year from now. 

</p><p>Even tomorrow was a gloomy, unclear day for her. 

</p><p>Sato looked at Karuizawa who wouldn’t move her gaze, and peeked around the area. 

</p><p>She wanted Karuizawa to cheer up. 

</p><p>That was her top priority, but Satou also had another goal in mind. 

</p><p>That is, to bump into Ayanokoji.

</p><p>If they haven’t reached a resolution yet, it would be difficult to contact them and bring them together, as they would be deliberately avoiding each other. 

</p><p>So, she had to rely on the power of coincidence.

</p><p>Fortunately, they had made contact and scheduled to meet up tomorrow, but it wouldn’t be so bad if they met ahead of schedule as well. 

</p><p>She was fine with anybody cheering Karuizawa up, as long as she got better. 

</p><p>All that remained was to run into Ayanokoji while spending time together.

</p><p>It would be the ideal turn of events if Satou could give them a good push there and get them to make up.

</p><p>However, one never finds the person they’re looking for when they want to.

</p><p>Besides, Satou was thinking about something else.

</p><p>If Ayanokoji knows that they are out here today, then maybe he would avoid showing himself on purpose. Karuizawa before her was the proof of this.

</p><p>She had not shown any signs of trying to find her boyfriend.

</p><p>She expected that Ayanokoji would avoid the two to refrain from bothering them, rather than out of malice. 

</p><p>As an unexpected encounter was not going to happen, Satou had no choice but to stand her ground here.

</p><p>“Come on, let’s forget about all that unpleasant stuff and have some fun.”

</p><p>Satou grabbed Karuizawa by both shoulders with a strong grip, trying to clear her mind.

</p><p>Karuizawa looked at Satou trying to cheer her friend up the best she could, and also started changing her mind. 

</p><p>Karuizawa had invited her friend here to thank her, but she was making her worry again instead. 

</p><p>She thought that there was no point in inviting her here if it was going to be like this. 

</p><p>“You’re right.” 

</p><p>Karuizawa decided that she would stop it with the pouty expression, even if only for now.

</p><p>Satou was a true friend and confidant to her after coming to this school. 

</p><p>She held out her hand, grateful for the warmth Satou provided her. 

</p><p>For a moment, Satou didn’t understand her intent, but she quickly understood after seeing Karuizawa’s smile. 

</p><p>She grabbed her hand and the two linked their hands together.

</p><p>She was a bit embarrassed, but she just did what the moment called for. 

</p><p>She still felt embarrassed, but their feelings connected.

</p><p>People may think that they’re child-like, or that they look like lovers. 

</p><p>They were just holding hands as two close friends.

</p><p>Nothing more, and nothing less. For now, the two didn’t pay any attention to the noises around them. 

</p><p>“Hehe. I’m gonna make you forget everything!”

</p><p>“Kyaah, so scary!” A world for just the two of them.

</p><p>Karuizawa and Satou decided to hang out in Keyaki mall from morning until night.
