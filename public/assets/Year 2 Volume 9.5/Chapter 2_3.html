    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        I was thinking back to my conversation with Ichinose this morning on my way home after parting with Kiryuuin.

    </p>
    <p>She was wondering if I would come to Keyaki Mall or not, but the heart of the matter is still unclear.

    </p>
    <p>Normally, I’d have used my phone to let her know that I was in the mall, but she didn’t want me to do that.

    </p>
    <p>Also judging by how she was expressing things in a roundabout way, she probably thought she could see me anyway
        if she just went to Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>For the time being, I’m choosing to leave without taking any action to search for Ichinose.

    </p>
    <p>I can just go back if I don’t see her on my way out of the mall.

    </p>
    <p>With that in mind, I returned to the vicinity of the mall’s entrance.

    </p>
    <p>There is a christmas tree set up here.

    </p>
    <p>Friends and couples were taking photos by the christmas tree or viewing it yesterday too, but that’s also going
        away tomorrow.

    </p>
    <p>Kei must be sorry that she’s sleeping right now, but there’s no helping it as influenza is already spreading and
        nearly 20 people in the entire school have tested positive for it.

    </p>
    <p>I saw that many students had indeed gathered in the vicinity as I walked by the tree.

    </p>
    <p>No, there were probably more students at this time yesterday.

    </p>
    <p>I spotted Ichinose among the crowd.

    </p>
    <p>She seems to be surrounded by three Year One girls for now, smiling happily and chatting with them.

    </p>
    <p>Since I dare not go talk to her, I decided to keep my distance and observe for a while.

    </p>
    <p>Then, Hoshinomiya-sensei and Chabashira-sensei walking next to her spotted me by chance.

    </p>
    <p>Teachers are often in plain clothes during long vacations, but I can’t help but feel particularly uncomfortable
        about Chabashira-sensei still wearing a suit.

    </p>
    <p>“Oh? Are you alone here?”

    </p>
    <p>The first one to call out to me was Hoshinomiya-sensei, and Chabashira-sensei followed suit.

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, I guess.”

    </p>
    <p>“I definitely thought you would be flirting and hanging out with your girlfriend yesterday and today. Did you get
        dumped?”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t make fun of students. Besides, Karuizawa has influenza.”

    </p>
    <p>
        Chabashira-sensei began to explain the circumstances, but…</p>
    <p>
        “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>“But you still messed with him?”

    </p>
    <p>“I mean, isn’t it annoying that a student younger than me gets to spend Christmas with his girlfriend?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s the same for you every year. It’s just that this year isn’t the same.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s why I can’t forgive this. I’m starting to feel like I understand how Sae-chan feels for the first time.”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t compare me with you. I don’t have anything against spending Christmas by myself. What a shame, though,
        Right Ayanokoji? I guess you can’t meet up with Karuizawa.”

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no helping it. Besides, I’m not against spending Christmas alone either.”

    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei laughed a little after that reply, and Hoshinomiya-sensei’s mood seemed to worsen in contrast.

    </p>
    <p>The two are in such a contrasting situation that it makes me think back to Mashima-sensei.

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure it will be very troublesome, no matter which side I support.

    </p>
    <p>“Where are you two going after this?”

    </p>
    <p>“Karaoke. We have a right to have fun too, you know~ Right~?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s just Chie who wants to sing, though. I’m just being dragged along.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh~ Really? Weren’t you pretty into it too, Sae-chan~?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not…”

    </p>
    <p>The teachers must be tired of the tense atmosphere caused by the class competitions.

    </p>
    <p>They headed off to the karaoke room, exchanging some small talk on whether they were on good terms or not.

    </p>
    <p>In the meantime, I noticed that Ichinose was looking over at me.

    </p>
    <p>It seems the girls finished talking to each other and I had actually ended up making her wait for me.

    </p>
    <p>“What a coincidence, Ayanokoji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, what a coincidence. It looked like you were having a lot of fun with the juniors from Year One.”

    </p>
    <p>“They’re from Year One B Class. You remember how Yagami from the Student Council suddenly got expelled, right? I
        guess it had an impact, since things are apparently still chaotic. They still seemed positive-minded, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Although the class itself should not be penalized by the nature of Yagami being sent in to expel me, they still
        suffered inevitable damage from missing a few people.

    </p>
    <p>I suppose the bitter situation is going to continue for a while after this too.

    </p>
    <p>“How long have you been here?”

    </p>
    <p>“Since 10:30 a.m. I think.”

    </p>
    <p>Considering that it’s almost 12 o’clock already, has she been waiting here for over an hour?

    </p>
    <p>No, it wouldn’t be right to express this as ‘waiting’.

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose is just acting based on her own philosophy of action.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, Ayanokoji-kun. Won’t you take a photo with me?”

    </p>
    <p>Saying this, Ichinose pulled out her camera while looking a little embarrassed.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ve been taking photos with a lot of people here today just for the sake of remembering.”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose opened her photo folder and showed today’s section to prove she was telling the truth.

    </p>
    <p>It turned out that she really had taken photos in front of the Christmas tree with various students.

    </p>
    <p>Some of them were also taken with boys from Ichinose’s class.

    </p>
    <p>There was also a photo with the Year One students from just now.

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose said that she was waiting at this spot to make memories, but her real goal became clear soon after that.

    </p>
    <p>“But, it’s because I want to take a photo with you. That’s my biggest wish.”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose didn’t give any more of a reason than that, but it’s not hard to figure it out.

    </p>
    <p>It wouldn’t look good if she had photos of just me on her phone and Kei or someone else learned about it.

    </p>
    <p>However, if she takes photos of a large number of people, both boys and girls, there’s not going to be a problem
        even if she is confronted.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, although there were not that many, there were also some one-on-one photos with boys from other classes.

    </p>
    <p>They were probably very happy to be approached by Ichinose, as they were making peace signs with embarrassed
        expressions.

    </p>
    <p>There was nothing in common among the boys in the photos, including the year.

    </p>
    <p>It looks like she was taking photos with everyone who asked.

    </p>
    <p>“So… Won’t you take a photo with me?”

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no reason to refuse, of course.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yay.”

    </p>
    <p>She spent a lot of effort just trying to get a photo with me.

    </p>
    <p>“I never intended to take so many photos with everyone, but I guess they heard about what I was doing, since a
        lot of people approached me. It was actually a little difficult to handle.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like there are rumours starting to spread that Ichinose wants to take photos with a lot of people.

    </p>
    <p>“How many people did you take photos with?”

    </p>
    <p>“Err, I think it’s 43 including the girls just now.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s pretty good…

        I can see that she’s quite quick-paced.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m going to continue for a while after this too. It would be profound if I stopped now, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose told me that she doesn’t want to leave traces behind even after reaching her objective.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, some people might also think I’m acting suspiciously, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose looked back on her demeanour which might be seen as suspicious when viewed objectively and smiled.

    </p>
    <p>If I did the same thing, I would definitely be treated like a suspicious person.

    </p>
    <p>However, the same actions look completely different when done by Ichinose.

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose pulled me by the arm and guided me to adjust the angle.

    </p>
    <p>She then leaned in closer and took her phone into her hand while putting the front camera on.

    </p>
    <p>“We can do it now since others aren’t looking.”

    </p>
    <p>She seems to be constantly observing her surroundings, so I suppose she decided this was the perfect time.

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose put her hand on my arm and took the photo.

    </p>
    <p>Then, she took another photo without her hand on my arm and with a little distance between us.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not going to keep the first photo… Okay?”
    </p>
    <p>“<a class="tooltip" data-tooltip='Ex post facto is Latin for "from a thing done afterward".'>Ex-post-facto</a>
        approval?”
    </p>
    <p>“...Yeah. I can delete it now too.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, you can keep it. I’m not going to blame you if anyone sees it. If they use it in some way, it’s my
        responsibility.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you sure about that? What if I use it in a bad way and damage your relationship with Karuizawa-san..?”

    </p>
    <p>“It would be a lot weirder to conveniently let you take the photo and complain about it after the fact. Don’t you
        think so too?”

    </p>
    <p>You shouldn’t let anyone take your photo if you aren’t ready for any possibility after.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, it’s a different story if you’re forced into it.

    </p>
    <p>We were only close to each other for about 10 seconds, and returned to our normal distance before anyone noticed.

    </p>
    <p>Noone during that time saw us being intimate.

    </p>
    <p>“By the way, Ayanokoji-kun, you met up with Chihiro-chan yesterday, right?”

    </p>
    <p>She’s talking about Shiranami. I thought back to the way she was listenişng to music with headphones on.

    </p>
    <p>“You know a lot, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“We often get together regardless of weekdays or vacations. So, yesterday, I felt like Chihiro-chan’s behaviour
        was a little different from usual. Did something happen? We didn’t talk specifics, but she did react to your
        name, so I figured that you two must have talked.”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose, who is always watching out for the mental states of her classmates, may have been able to notice the
        change in Shiranami <a class="tooltip"
            data-tooltip='Japanese saying, literally ‘before breakfast’. Means ‘very easy’.'> very easily.</a>
    </p>

    <p>“By the way, what do you mean different? I hope the change wasn’t in a bad direction.”

    </p>
    <p>“She’s okay. I don’t know what you talked about, but I feel like she was laughing a lot more than usual
        yesterday.”

    </p>
    <p>It was a somewhat risky gamble, but it seems urging her to be prepared seems to have worked in the right
        direction.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m glad to hear that.”

    </p>
    <p>“But…”

    </p>
    <p>I was happy about Shiranami’s growth, but Ichinose didn’t end it there.

    </p>
    <p>“She’s still really concerned about me, but don’t get too deeply into it, okay? That girl has a tendency to be
        easily influenced.”

    </p>
    <p>A warning to not to get closer with Shiranami than I am now.

    </p>
    <p>“If you ever want to hang out with Chihiro-chan, it would be great if you call me too.”

    </p>
    <p>“Okay. I’ll make sure to do that.”

    </p>
    <p>Is this her duty as a guardian of the class, or is it for her own sake?

    </p>
    <p>I have to be careful if I meet Shiranami again in the future.

    </p>
    <p>“Ichinose-senpai! Ayanokoji-senpai! Hello!”

    </p>
    <p>“Ah, it’s Nanase-san.”

    </p>
    <p>Nanase-san found us and approached us at a half-sprint.

    </p>
    <p>“I came over after hearing you were taking photos here.”

    </p>
    <p>Apparently, the rumours are beginning to spread until Nanase.

    </p>
    <p>“Aren’t things going to get out of hand if you handle this poorly? You might have to keep taking photos until
        midnight.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll worry about that when that time comes. Maybe I’ll become a legendary girl that took photos with all the
        students in school in front of the tree.”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose returned the joke with her own and showed us a smile.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you here with her too, Ayanokoji-senpai?”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh, no, I just came here to take photos with her after hearing the rumours too. I’m not gonna bother her.”

    </p>
    <p>I’m not going to clumsily participate in this, so I decided to take a step back.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t mind if you stay with me, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, it’s okay. I don’t want to be bound to this place like you, and there’s not a lot of guys that want to take
        a photo with me.”

    </p>
    <p>Nanase, understanding the situation, did not force things any further and stood shoulder to shoulder with
        Ichinose.

    </p>
    <p>They started adjusting their positions to take photos, but Nanase noticed something and stopped.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, could you wait a moment?”

    </p>
    <p>“Hm? Sure, but what happened?”

    </p>
    <p>Nanase apologized to Ichinose while running off in a certain direction.

    </p>
    <p>It was a student from the same class as Nanase, Housen.

    </p>
    <p>He’s walking by himself with a frightening expression without looking over here.

    </p>
    <p>Nanase approached Housen like a puppy and greeted him, then pointed over at us and said something.

    </p>
    <p>“Is she inviting Housen-kun over?”

    </p>
    <p>“It… looks that way.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s nothing suspicious to invite a classmate over, but it’s Housen.

    </p>
    <p>He’s definitely not the type to take photos with us.

    </p>
    <p>After a brief conversation with Nanase however, Housen turned around to us and started walking with a scary
        expression, as if he remembered something.

    </p>
    <p>“It looks like he’s coming.”

    </p>
    <p>“It… looks that way.”

    </p>
    <p>Housen’s eyes seized not just Ichinose, but also me standing next to her.

    </p>
    <p>I’d like to avoid any new causes for conflict while I’m relaxing during this winter vacation.

    </p>
    <p>“Umm, can Housen-kun take a photo with us too?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course, but is it okay?”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose’s remark contained the question of - Is that what Housen wants to do?

    </p>
    <p>Housen didn’t say a word, but kept looking at me and Ichinose in turns with a scary expression.

    </p>
    <p>“I think it’s totally fine. Come on, Housen-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>Saying that, Nanase almost forcefully pushed Housen from behind.

    </p>
    <p>I definitely thought he would resist, but he actually approached us with light steps.

    </p>
    <p>“The fuck are you looking at? Is there something on my face?”

    </p>
    <p>I thought he was about to speak, but then he turned to me with a glare.

    </p>
    <p>“No, well…”

    </p>
    <p>This is definitely unlike him. One can’t help but wonder what’s behind it.

    </p>
    <p>“Well? Got something to say?”

    </p>
    <p>“Nothing.”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh!”

    </p>
    <p>When I pulled back, Housen laughed and looked away.

    </p>
    <p>He has an impact that’s uncharacteristic of a Year One student.

    </p>
    <p>I feel like he’s going to stab us with a knife if we get involved with him in a careless way.

    </p>
    <p>Despite some rough words, Housen and Nanase finished taking photos with Ichinose.

    </p>
    <p>Housen, still looking like he wanted to say something, put his hands in his pockets and started walking away.

    </p>
    <p>“What was that all about?”

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t understand, but Nanase came closer to me and whispered in a voice no one else could hear.

    </p>
    <p>“Actually, Housen-kun really likes Ichinose-senpai.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Seriously?”

    </p>
    <p>I couldn’t say for sure, but it definitely didn’t look like that.

    </p>
    <p>No, I thought it was strange that he would line up with Ichinose and take photos, but that’s still way too
        unlikely of a story.

    </p>
    <p>“He heard she was taking photos here, so he came over to see what’s happening.”

    </p>
    <p>In other words, it wasn't a coincidence, but intended.

    </p>
    <p>“But, couldn’t it be a coincidence?”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think so. I came to Keyaki Mall at Housen-kun’s request. He probably couldn’t talk to Ichinose-san
        alone, so he wanted to use me.”

    </p>
    <p>If this was a calculated move, did he really just want to take a photo with Ichinose?

    </p>
    <p>It really doesn’t seem that way from his attitude just now, though.

    </p>
    <p>Housen is already out of our sights, so I have no way of confirming it now.

    </p>
    <p>“Ah, Ichinose~ Take a photo with me too!”

    </p>
    <p>A pair of Year Three girls approached Ichinose while waving at her.

    </p>
    <p>Are there going to be more and more people coming as long as she stays here?

    </p>
    <p>I lightly greeted the seniors and decided to distance myself.

    </p>
    <p>“See you later, Ayanokoji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose faintly waved at me and seemed to have naturally switched her attention to the seniors.

    </p>
    <p>It seems to have become quite the large-scale deal, but I’m just one of 43 people… </p>
    <p>
        46 including me, Nanase and Housen.
    </p>
