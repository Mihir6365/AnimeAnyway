    <h3>Part 4</h3><p>
“I’m going to the toilet.”

</p><p>He drank some water from his paper cup, stood up with both hands in his pockets and left his seat.

</p><p>Yousuke began to talk about the recent circumstances after seeing Sudou off.

</p><p>“I heard from a Year One member of the basketball club that he’s a very strict but caring senior regardless of gender and is well-liked. His stance when he joined the club last year was that all he needed to do was to be good at basketball, so the Year Three students seem to be surprised at his transformation.”

</p><p>Thanks to Yousuke’s extensive social circle, he seems to know a side of Sudou that is hidden from the rest.

</p><p>“Now that he’s studying well in addition to his basketball, I’m sure the girls will be swarming him.”

</p><p>“Don’t tell this to anyone else, but a junior girl asked me for Sudou-kun’s number.”

</p><p>“Wasn’t Sudou really happy about that?” 

</p><p>I’m sure being popular is one of the things Sudou always wished for. 

</p><p>However, Yousuke had a slightly complicated, bitter smile.

</p><p>“I figured that I would ask Sudou for permission first, but he told me to refuse her since he was sure she was just playing a joke. I don’t think he cared that much.”

</p><p>It seems that Sudou is unaware of how popular he is with girls, starting with Onodera. 

</p><p>“It may be a while until spring arrives for him.” 

</p><p>“Yeah.”

</p><p>Yousuke replied with a smile and looked down at the books I had.

</p><p>“I was just wondering, only one of the books has a book cover.”

</p><p>There are some books borrowed from the library that have a clear protective film over them, but this one was clearly different.

</p><p>“I got this one just now. You know Shiina Hiyori from the Ryuen Class, right?”

</p><p>“Mhm. Actually, I’ve seen her a lot with you… You got it from her?” 

</p><p>“She recommended it to me since she loves it and we have similar tastes.” 

</p><p>“I see…”

</p><p>Yousuke calmly lowered his eyebrows and seemed dissatisfied. 

</p><p>“What is it?” 

</p><p>“Oh, nothing.”

</p><p>Yousuke replied so, but he still had a slightly concerned expression. 

</p><p>Our conversation stopped here and silence began. 

</p><p>I started thinking about whether I should change the subject. 

</p><p>“By the way, how long will you continue club activities? You have to think about the entrance tests when you’re a Year Three, right?” 

</p><p>The topic is completely unrelated to the subject at hand, so Yousuke answered in a confused manner. 

</p><p>“Yeah… I don’t have anything concrete in mind, but most people stop in June. I think that’s about right if you need to focus on your studies. There’s some people who continue a little longer into the summer ahead if they put a lot of importance on their club, though.” 

</p><p>Although he has to decide whether or not to go to university and how long it would take him to prepare for the entrance test, June is still earlier than I expected. 

</p><p>“Yousuke, are you thinking about what you’re going to do?”

</p><p>“Hmm… It’s not like there’s any guarantee I can graduate in A Class, and I think my parents want me to go to university, so I think I’m going to stop around June in that case.” 

</p><p>There is fundamentally no contact with people who live off site in this school. However, there are a few exceptions. 

</p><p>One of them is related to higher education and employment. 

</p><p>Even if a child decides to go to higher education, there are many decisions they cannot make alone, like which university or vocational school, how much it will cost and such. 

</p><p>There are also more than a few students who want to consult their parents about employment as well.

</p><p>In such a case, the school is also present and a discussion is held about the student’s schooling.

</p><p>This is a system and rule that I have nothing to do with, but for students who wish to go on to higher education, it’s something that they cannot avoid.

</p><p>This system however can only be used from the third term onwards.

</p><p>The reason is that it’s possible to avoid studying unnecessary things after Year Three by deciding on one’s school of choice. 

</p><p>You can set your goals after deciding on the level and department of the university to which you’ll apply.

</p><p>Even if there’s a high level university that you want to apply to, the acceptance announcement for the general university entrance test will be in February or March. 

</p><p>This is to be decided before graduating from school. 

</p><p>The question here is the benefit of graduating in the A Class. 

</p><p>This school can fulfill your wish to go on to the university of your choice or to find a job, and if you have failed entering your university of choice, they will follow up with you to turn it into a pass. 

</p><p>However, this only grants admission to the school, and it’s up to the individual to successfully graduate from it. 

</p><p>To put it mildly, a student with middle-school level Academic Ability who enters the University of Tokyo won’t be able to make any decent progress. 

</p><p>Leaving aside the problems with enrollment, this is a very easy to understand example. 

</p><p>On the other hand, there are cases in which the student was able to graduate in A Class and also enroll in university with their own ability.

</p><p>Of course, such cases are also quite possible. 

</p><p>In this case, there are several things that this school can do for you, starting with covering your university costs. 

</p><p>This is for students who have the ability to attend university but cannot afford the tuition. 

</p><p>It’s a measure for students who do not want to borrow scholarship money or have other reasons for not being able to borrow it, but want to go onto university. 

</p><p>However, the scholarship will only cover tuition fees : they must pay their living expenses separately, and it’s not possible to ask for additional funds if you repeat a year. 

</p><p>The coverage is based solely on the standard period of time it takes to graduate from university. 

</p><p>The other approach is after graduation. 

</p><p>The university can also help you find a job if you graduated in A Class. 

</p><p>In other words, there’s also a strategy not to use the A Class’ privilege for enrolling in university. 

</p><p>In an extreme case, you may be able to get into a prestigious company that requires a university degree by going to a low-level university and using your privilege after graduation. 

</p><p>However, this is only about getting the job. 

</p><p>Whether or not the student will have the capacity to actually work at the company is a different matter. 

</p><p>Above all, it’s a tightrope walk. 

</p><p>No matter how much effort you put into raising your child, I’m sure you’d still feel unhappy if they got rejected by even 1% of companies. 

</p><p>“What about you, Ayanokoji? Will you go on to university?” 

</p><p>“I’m not sure. You might think I’m slow, but I still haven’t made a decision. I may go on to university, or I might get a job. God only knows, as they say.”

</p><p>“I don’t think there’s any need to hurry. I think you can handle most things pretty well.”

</p><p>I appreciate that evaluation, but unfortunately, I don’t have a choice.

</p><p>Yousuke’s behaviour was somewhat strange while we were talking about career paths. 

</p><p>Yousuke started speaking when that conversation got interrupted for a moment. 

</p><p>“...Are you close to Shiina-san?”

</p><p>He stopped the subject himself once, but it looks like he still has some worries.

</p><p>“Hiyori? I’m not sure. I think we might be close as reading buddies, at least. Is there something on your mind?” 

</p><p>I wanted to find out what was bothering Yousuke, so I stepped in and asked him. 

</p><p>“I’m just curious since you seem to call her by her first name. I’ve never heard it outside of our class.”

</p><p>It’s certainly unusual. 

</p><p>“Since when?”

</p><p>“Since when? I’m not sure. I don’t remember that part too clearly.” 

</p><p>I never noticed I started calling Hiyori by her first name. 

</p><p>Thinking back on it, I think I’ve been calling her that since shortly after we met. 

</p><p>It was just an act in my daily life, however, so my brain couldn’t grasp the specific timing. 

</p><p>“So there wasn’t a specific reason for you to start calling her by her first name?” 

</p><p>“Yeah, not really. I guess it just happened one day.” 

</p><p>“I see…” 

</p><p>“Is it bad?”

</p><p>“No, that’s not it. Normally, it’s good to be friendly with a lot of people.” 

</p><p>Normally.

</p><p>In other words, a different case than mine. 

</p><p>However, Yousuke didn’t continue talking about this, so I’m not going to encourage him to continue. 

</p><p>We just waited for Sudou to come back.
