    <h3>Part 6</h3>

    <p>
        Sakayanagi smiled quietly by herself after Ayanokouji left.

    </p>
    <p>“The other day, on the closing ceremony of the second term, we chatted with the three of us with Ichinose-san,
        didn’t we?”

    </p>
    <p>A few muttered words, drowned out by the wind.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m in a position to teach her. That’s what I always thought, but I learned that it wasn’t so.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s the moment Sakayanagi completely woke up to her own love.

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi continued talking to herself in the lonely, snowy night.

    </p>
    <p>“I recognize you as a foe that I must defeat.”

    </p>
    <p>This is the real, undeniable truth.

    </p>
    <p>“Someone like me, a proud genius from birth, isn’t going to lose to a genius that was manufactured.”

    </p>
    <p>This is her ideology.

    </p>
    <p>“However, aside from my perception that I should defeat you, another one was born. You noticed it, didn’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>Ayanokouji’s back, now disappeared from her sight.

    </p>
    <p>Delivering with a voice that won’t be delivered.

    </p>
    <p>She put it into words once again.

    </p>
    <p>“I love you.”

    </p>
    <p>Ichinose, who was like a piece of trash lying on the side of the road to Sakayanagi, made her realize this.

    </p>
    <p>“If I conveyed my thoughts more clearly, I probably couldn’t make you change your expression a little.”

    </p>
    <p>This is the only reason she did not use stronger words face-to-face.

    </p>
    <p>Be that as it may, she is not afraid of acceptance or nonacceptance.

    </p>
    <p>“Yes. That is the kind of person you are, Ayanokouji-kun. You are not the kind of person who would be disturbed
        by something this trivial.”

    </p>
    <p>Normally, a young lady would be hurt and distressed by something like this.

    </p>
    <p>However, Sakayanagi is the opposite.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, she strongly realizes that this is precisely why she is drawn to Ayanokouji.

    </p>
    <p>“You treat everyone in this school, including me, like children. You think everything is going to go as you wish,
        and I’m sure you’ve made it so that it has.”

    </p>
    <p>She took a step on the snowy road.

    </p>
    <p>She understands Ayanokouji’s plans in concrete terms.

    </p>
    <p>The composition he will envision in Year Three.

    </p>
    <p>It wouldn’t be interesting to let things progress as he wants.

    </p>
    <p>In which case, she already knows the answer as to how to disrupt his plans.

    </p>
    <p>She wants to hinder him.

    </p>
    <p>She wants to see worry on his face.

    </p>
    <p>She wants to confront him with the fact that some things are beyond his control.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s a shame. Your plan has already started deviating from its course back at the Uninhabited Island Test that
        summer.”

    </p>
    <p>She really wanted to let him know that, but it’s still a secret.

    </p>
    <p>It’s the not knowing, not being able to tell what’s going to happen, that makes the future interesting.

    </p>
    <p>“I promise that this fact will be the first step in changing you in a direction you never thought possible.”

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi is looking forward to seeing what decisions he will make in the future.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m really looking forward to the third semester…”

    </p>
