    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h2>Looking Into Each Other
    </h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        December 26.

    </p>
    <p>Students of the Horikita class, including Sudou and the others who had no club activities that day, were gathered
        in a cafe in Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>There were eight students: Ike, Sudou, Shinohara, Matsushita, Mori, Wang, Maezono, and Onodera.

    </p>
    <p>It was Maezono who invited these members for the gathering, and everyone was curious when she said that she
        wanted to talk about something important for the class after school.

    </p>
    <p>First of all, it was way too stiff and serious of a topic of discussion for a girl like Maezono.

    </p>
    <p>Further, the people who would be called the main members of the class were intentionally left out.

    </p>
    <p>Why were Horikita and Hirata, major members of the class, not invited?

    </p>
    <p>They are essential for discussions on the future of the class.

    </p>
    <p>Most of the eight members were not against gathering together, however, so they accepted Maezono’s invitation as
        something playful, while Matsushita was the only one who had suspicions.

    </p>
    <p>However, Matsushita did not directly confront Maezono with her doubts either, but instead showed up at the
        meeting like the other 6, even if just for appearance sake.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps because of the relatively large number of participants, Maezono chose a cafe in Keyaki Mall as the
        meeting place.

    </p>
    <p>When the appointed time of 11:30 a.m. arrived, all six members excluding Ike and Shınohara were there.

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita became more suspicious after seeing the assembled members.

    </p>
    <p>She wondered why they would discuss the future of the class in such a public place.

    </p>
    <p>Because of Maezono’s personality and abilities, she did not believe that there would be a substantive discussion.

    </p>
    <p>Even so, she still wanted her to be more selective about the location of the meeting, since it was labeled as an
        important one.

    </p>
    <p>Maezono showed no signs of understanding Matsushita’s thoughts, but instead was laughing with excitement as she
        chatted about the TV show she had watched yesterday.

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, who is relatively close to Maezono, seems to be in even better spirits these days than before.

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry to keep you waiting~”

    </p>
    <p>Ike and Shinohara arrived at the meeting place a little later than Matsushita.

    </p>
    <p>The two showed up in an intimate manner holding hands, and sat down in the chairs that were arranged in a natural
        way with the surroundings.

    </p>
    <p>“Stop being so flirty in the public during day-time, you two. Also, you’re late.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou said in a joking manner to Ike, bothered by the passion of the two’s love.

    </p>
    <p>“Hehehe, we don’t do that. Right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, we’re totally normal. You’re used to being late too, aren’t you, Sudou-kun?”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou sighed as the two did not let go of each other’s hands even after sitting down.

    </p>
    <p>“I haven’t been doing that lately.”

    </p>
    <p>He replied so, but it didn’t seem to reach Shinohara and the others’ ears.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, those two…”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, looks like it.”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita nodded in response to Maezono’s whisper.

    </p>
    <p>The two’s behaviour clearly seems to have changed either on the 24th or the 25th.

    </p>
    <p>It’s definitely a prediction that the two crossed a line in their relationship.

    </p>
    <p>Although such rumours had been circulating even during the school trip, there was no proof of it, but the two’s
        current attitude would certainly make their classmates realize it.

    </p>
    <p>“That Kanji guy…”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou and Ike have known each other for a long time, and they were talking a lot last year about what they wanted
        to do when they got girlfriends.

    </p>
    <p>He was frustrated that he had been beaten to the punch, but he was also fed up by having to see all the flirting.

    </p>
    <p>This unconsciously manifested as a wavy sigh.

    </p>
    <p>“What is it, Sudou-kun?”

    </p>
    <p>Onodera, sitting next to Sudou, was confused about Sudou’s complicated state of mind and spoke to him in a
        whisper with a little worry.

    </p>
    <p>“Nothing. More importantly, I’m glad to see that the class is back to normal.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. There was a lot of fighting just a little while ago.”

    </p>
    <p>Immediately after the Unanimous Special Exam, some were concerned that some friendships might collapse due to the
        unrelenting exposure of Kushida.

    </p>
    <p>Wang, who had made it known that she liked Hirata, was saved by Matsushita and the others’ support, and
        Shinohara, who had been teased about her appearance, was completely restored with the support of her boyfriend,
        Ike.

    </p>
    <p>The fact that they are now able to get together like this is evidence that the relationships are gradually being
        restored over time.

    </p>
    <p>“Maezono, let’s move on.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou urged Maezono, unable to stand watching the sultry couple messing around.

    </p>
    <p>“Right. Really, thanks for gathering here today everyone.”

    </p>
    <p>First, Maezono expressed her gratitude for all seven students who showed up.

    </p>
    <p>At first, Maezono was foul-mouthed and ill-mannered, starting fights with everyone, but she seems to have
        gradually mellowed, and she did not seem to dislike the company of the members here for now.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, she is almost friends with Wang and Satou.

    </p>
    <p>She is also close with Matsushita, but she doesn’t appreciate Maezono in her mind.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s fine for us to get together, but why is it just us talking about the class’ future? What’s the important
        thing you wanted to talk about?”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita seemed to have the same thing on her mind as Sudou, and asked about it.

    </p>
    <p>Matsuhita hoped that the discussion would move forward after Sudou spoke on her behalf.

    </p>
    <p>“Now that you mention it, yeah. Why?”

    </p>
    <p>Ike and Shinohara looked at each other as if they just noticed something for the first time.

    </p>
    <p>They simply hadn’t thought of that. Matsushita had a theory in a corner of her mind, but…
    </p>
    <p>
        “Mhm. There’s actually a proper reason for this… I didn’t invite Hinata-kun and the others on purpose. There’s
        something I want to make clear before the third term starts.”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono started talking about her goals after clearly explaining her reasoning.

    </p>
    <p>“To speak clearly, this is about Ayanokouji-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>The name of a classmate.

    </p>
    <p>The other seven members didn’t show much of a reaction, or rather did not seem to understand why Ayanokouji’s
        name had come up.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t know if it’s a problem for me to say this, but I don’t like Ayanokouji-kun, no, maybe that’s not quite
        right. Honestly, he’s just not my favourite.”

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps she thought that she expressed herself too sternly, so she corrected herself afterwards.

    </p>
    <p>“Not your favourite? Why is that?”

    </p>
    <p>Wang continued with a question in response to Maezono’s honest assessment.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokouji-kun is not someone who causes problems, nor is he someone who makes forceful connections.”

    </p>
    <p class="italic">I don’t think he’s been giving a bad impression of himself to Maezono.

    </p>
    <p>That was Wang’s honest feelings about it.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, yeah, but I’m trying to say that I don’t like gloomy people… He makes me feel a bit strange the way he’s
        never on the same wavelength with us, or how he doesn’t get excited about doing stuff with us, and it feels like
        he’s keeping us at arm’s length.”

    </p>
    <p>“In other words, it’s a one-sided thing?”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, who had been silent up until then, asked Maezono.

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm, that might be a part of it too.”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I guess Ayanokouji is a bit gloomy. Like a background character? He’s also always silent.”

    </p>
    <p>Ike agreed that the image Maezono had of Ayanokouji was not so different from his.

    </p>
    <p>It was not a question of liking or disliking him, but it seemed that no one would immediately deny that
        Ayanokouji’s character is quiet and gloomy, but…</p>
    <p>

        “He’s different now, isn’t he? I think he is, at least.”
    </p>
    <p>The first voice of dissent came from Sudou.

    </p>
    <p>“Besides, it’s not like he could date someone like Karuizawa if he was such a dark-natured guy, right?”

    </p>
    <p>He did not simply object, but also added his basis for it.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I was surprised to see him dating Karuizawa, but, still…”

    </p>
    <p>Ike is convinced about some things, but the image in his mind still isn’t changing.

    </p>
    <p>“You've been chatting a lot with Ayanokouji lately, Ken. When did you start getting along so well with him?”

    </p>
    <p>Ike, perhaps judging it to be a defensive remark rather than a sound one, butted in.

    </p>
    <p>Sudou was taken aback by this and picked up his drink cup.

    </p>
    <p>“We had hung out a lot when we first enrolled, including with you, didn’t we?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, we did, but it was just as classmates, and we never got along that well. Did you really think of him as a
        friend?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well…”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou wanted to say something back here, but he choked up as he thought back to their early days after enrolling.

    </p>
    <p>Sudou and Ike started glaring at each other, so Maezono hurriedly stopped them.

    </p>
    <p>“Hey, wait a bit, don’t start any fights. I still haven’t entered the main subject. There’s a lot of stuff I want
        to ask Sudou-kun about Ayanokouji-kun today, since he gets along well with him.”

    </p>
    <p>They stopped glaring at each other, and Sudou replied after a sigh.

    </p>
    <p>“...Me?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. Out of all of us, you probably know the most about Ayanokouji’s current circumstances.”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono, thinking that there was no point in dragging the subject any further, began by slightly lowering her
        voice.

    </p>
    <p>Still, to her friends who still didn’t understand, she added,
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ayanokouji-kun isn’t just a gloomy classmate… Right? I think there’s something he’s hiding.”

    </p>
    <p>Including Ike and Shinohara, everyone now started to understand what Maezono was trying to say.

    </p>
    <p>“Is today’s meeting going to be to discuss who Ayanokouji-kun really is?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono nodded two, three times to Wang’s words and affirmed.

    </p>
    <p>“Of course, I excluded his girlfriend Karuizawa-san, his close friend Satou-san, and also Hirata-kun,
        Horikita-san, who have been in close contact with Ayanokouji-kun, and also Hasebe-san, who he had formed a group
        with.”

    </p>
    <p>“Why is that? I think it would be best to have as many people as possible who know more about him…”

    </p>
    <p>“Would it, though? I think that we’d actually get tricked instead. I think all of the people I just named know
        who Ayanokouji-kun really is.”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono muttered, saying that it had to be this way to work.

    </p>
    <p>That’s why she left out the people, who as far as she knows, have a strong connection with Ayanokouji.

    </p>
    <p>“The discussion won’t go smoothly if not everyone knows Ayanokouji-kun, right? I feel like Sudou-kun will tell us
        about him anyway.”

    </p>
    <p>It is essential to have someone with information in order to deepen the discussion.

    </p>
    <p>Maezono proudly replied that she had thought it over and selected trustworthy people.

    </p>
    <p>“I think I have an idea of what’s going on, but do we really have to gather and talk about it with such caution?”

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara, who had come to understand the situation, tilted her head to the side and spoke out her doubts.

    </p>
    <p>“For now, yes. It’s fine if nothing happens after our discussion, but… I mean, Ayanokouji-kun’s presence is
        clearly strange, isn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>The members all looked at each other.

    </p>
    <p>A silence continued for some time, but someone followed up from Maezono’s opinion from an unexpected point.

    </p>
    <p>“...Yeah, I do honestly think from time to time that he’s strange.”

    </p>
    <p>It seemed a bit difficult to say out loud, but Wang put her own thoughts into words.

    </p>
    <p>“Right? Right?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono was glad to see someone agree with her and didn’t try to hide her expression.

    </p>
    <p>“Strange? In concrete terms, what do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara pitched forward and asked, not understanding which part they meant.

    </p>
    <p>“I think there’s a gap between him and the evaluation the school shows with the OAA. I think his score in the
        OAA, both in Academic Ability and Physical Ability, is lower than the reality.”

    </p>
    <p>“How was his OAA?”

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara showed Ike her phone from the side.

    </p>
    <p>“...It really is strange. I don’t think I’m convinced that he’s above me on the whole.”

    </p>
    <p>Ike groaned with a serious look after looking at the OAA.

    </p>
    <p>“No, that’s just because you’re no good, Kanji.”

    </p>
    <p>“He’s also been improving a lot since the first time the OAA was introduced. He might have been working hard and
        improving like Sudou-kun, but would you say that you don’t see its traces?”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou, who had the lowest grade of E in Academic Ability, has improved his grade by studying every day and
        improving his attitude towards life, which is clear to everyone in the class.

    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, in Ayanokouji’s case, no one can see any traces of effort.

    </p>
    <p>He suddenly gets high scores in tests, suddenly shows off the speed of his legs, and so it is not surprising that
        Wang thinks it is strange.

    </p>
    <p>“The conclusion you’d get from that is that he wasn’t giving it his all, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono put into words what she had been wanting to say since before she gathered her friends.

    </p>
    <p>“I think that’s possible.”

    </p>
    <p>“You’re saying he was holding back?”

    </p>
    <p>“Wasn’t he? He’s never been doing this seriously, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“For what, though?”

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe he hates trying?”

    </p>
    <p>Everyone spoke their minds and things started to get out of hand.

    </p>
    <p>“Wait a bit. I get what you’re trying to say, but that’s not the only possibility, is it? Ayanokouji-kun never
        liked standing out in the first place, so couldn’t he be working hard in secret?”

    </p>
    <p>It was Matsushita who put a stop to the flow of bad speculations.

    </p>
    <p>She pointed to the possibility that Ayanokouji had developed his abilities behind the scenes, as opposed to Sudou
        who had developed his out in the open.

    </p>
    <p>His reputation will be tarnished if he had been hiding his abilities since the start.

    </p>
    <p>In other words, it would be seen as him not making any effort for the class’ sake.

    </p>
    <p>If they would be making speculations, she wanted to take them in the good direction.

    </p>
    <p>“He never looked that impressive back when we first started school. Maybe he was just trying really hard to prove
        himself superior to everyone? Come on, I improved after working hard at it too, didn’t I?”

    </p>
    <p>Ike followed up without thinking too much about it.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you really sure you know, Ike-kun?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono continued with a little anger towards Ike.

    </p>
    <p>“W-Why wouldn’t I know?”

    </p>
    <p>“I mean, did you notice that Ayanokouji-kun flawlessly solved 5 questions in that Special Test?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I did, but… A lot of other people did the same, didn’t they?”

    </p>
    <p>Students with B or above in Academic Ability, such as Horikita or Hirata have perfect scores.

    </p>
    <p>“The problems Ayanokouji-kun solved were more difficult than the ones Horikita or the others did. I looked at the
        results of the students from other classes, and the questions were so difficult that even students with A in
        Academic Ability could get them wrong.”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono firmly claimed that this could not be done with just a little hard work.

    </p>
    <p>“I mean, come on though, math was his specialty, wasn’t it? Isn’t it normal in that case?”

    </p>
    <p>“Only one of the questions he solved was about mathematics. Other than that, he also solved 2 English questions,
        1 Chemistry, and 1 Modern Japanese question. It wasn’t just one subject at all.”

    </p>
    <p>She had done her research before gathering the 7 students.

    </p>
    <p>Maezono emphasized that Ayanokouji is not strong in just one particular subject.

    </p>
    <p>“That might be true. I thought that seemed a little strange as well.”

    </p>
    <p>Wang, the most studious of the 7, nodded in agreement.

    </p>
    <p>“Considering that as well, I started thinking that the difference between his OAA and his true abilities is
        greater than I even imagined.”

    </p>
    <p>“Right? Right? It’s definitely weird, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita thought about interrupting Maezono’s scolding remark, but stopped.

    </p>
    <p>It was clear that she was having a hard time believing the questions just happened to be from parts that
        Ayanokouji had been studying.

    </p>
    <p>If she had followed up too much in a clumsy way, it would appear that she was defending him.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, Matsushita wants Ayanokouji to play a useful role for the class in the future, and does not want him to
        gather his classmate’s scorn in unrelated areas.

    </p>
    <p>That is why she decided that she should not explicitly speak on Ayanokouji’s behalf at this time.

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe he just got really lucky with his guesses?”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita was saved by someone who is not a defender of Ayanokouji, Ike, and his almost spontaneous comment.

    </p>
    <p>Ike’s natural willingness to say what Matsushita couldn’t make him consider Ike as a necessary person in this
        situation.

    </p>
    <p>“No, it’s not intuition or coincidence. I’m sure he was always studying from the start.”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono clearly asserted that this could not be explained by the word ‘intuition’.

    </p>
    <p>“Is there any other reason?”

    </p>
    <p>Wang asked back, probably interested in knowing the truth.

    </p>
    <p>Maezono lowered her voice again after taking a look around.

    </p>
    <p>“I heard this from someone else, okay? They conducted a lot of tests on the Uninhabited Island this year for
        goods or points, right? I heard that the study questions Ayanokouji participated in were very difficult, but he
        answered all of them correctly without any trouble.”

    </p>
    <p>It is true that Ayanokouji’s Academic Ability was indeed high, even before the Special Test held in December.

    </p>
    <p>Although Maezono prefaced her story with the fact that she heard it from someone else, it's spreading here as if
        it’s true.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t know the truth, but… Yeah. Ayanokouji-kun’s image hasn’t changed that much since the start, but… I feel
        like his surroundings have changed a lot. Hirata-kun seems to trust him a lot, and they call each other by their
        first names. I think Hirata-kun’s probably the only one doing that.”

    </p>
    <p>If Wang, who observes and favours Hirata more than anyone else, is saying this, then there is no doubt about it.

    </p>
    <p>Everyone in the room did not say anything, but they did not hesitate to trust and listen to her.

    </p>
    <p>“Horikita-san is the one pulling the class behind her, but… Ayanokouji’s been behind that once or twice, hasn’t
        he?”

    </p>
    <p>Onodera, Ike and Shinohara started nodding their heads in agreement after Maezono’s passionate remark again.

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita listened to the discussion around her and was convinced again.

    </p>
    <p>The people in the class have already begun to realize the potential that Ayanokouji possesses.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, this is because Ayanokouji is moving more openly than he was in Year One, but the problem is that this
        can be perceived in a bad way.

    </p>
    <p>So, she decided that she should move on to a different position.

    </p>
    <p>“You may be right about that, Maezono-san. Ayanokouji has had mediocre results for a long time, so he still can’t
        get an A or above even if he gets good results now.”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita also switched to the agreeing side, and Maezono’s expression changed into one of pride.

    </p>
    <p>“Is there something special that you know about Ayanokouji-kun, Sudou? Hopefully something we don’t know
        already?”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou showed a confused expression as Maezono asked her with great anticipation.

    </p>
    <p>“What? Is there something? Tell me if there is.”

    </p>
    <p>A woman’s intuition. Maezono did not miss the expression on his face as she pursued further.

    </p>
    <p>The thing he felt when he saw the Housen matter at the beginning of Year Two.

    </p>
    <p>A glimpse of Ayanokouji’s strength.

    </p>
    <p>Sudou wondered if he should talk about these events or not.

    </p>
    <p>He wondered to himself, although the series of incidents were kept secret to pretend they never happened, he
        doesn’t have to keep Ayanokouji’s abilities a secret, does he?

    </p>
    <p>If it was something that had to be kept secret, he would have been strongly reminded to do so.

    </p>
    <p>“...Yeah. You guys only pay attention to his studies, but I don’t think his only strength is his Academic
        Ability.”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh? What do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>“You all saw it on the relay too, didn’t you? How fast he was? He’s even faster than me.”

    </p>
    <p>They had never directly competed, but Sudou already accepted defeat.

    </p>
    <p>However, there was little surprise at this stage from among those around him.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, everyone knew that he was very unusual when he competed with Horikita Manabu, the former student council
        president.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s true, but we all know that already, don’t we?”

    </p>
    <p>Directly after, however, the truth coming through Sudou’s words would be different.

    </p>
    <p>“Besides, it’s not just the speed of his legs. I don’t feel great about admitting this, but his motor nerves are
        overall better than mine.”

    </p>
    <p>“E-Even you!?”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou continued as he thought about which words would best convey Ayanokouji’s power.

    </p>
    <p>“If he gets serious, I can really only beat him at basketball, and I don’t even want to play against him anyway.
        I don’t think I’d lose, but I instinctively feel like he’d catch up to me as we play.”

    </p>
    <p>This alone gave a sense of reality to such a hard-to-believe fact.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s a great story if it’s true, but what’s your basis?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono excitedly asked Sudou to explain why they should believe him.

    </p>
    <p>Since he couldn’t tell the story of his troubles with Housen, he decided that he had to make something up.

    </p>
    <p>“I had a fight with Ayanokouji once. I started it, but I couldn’t even hit him when I tried. It’s like I could
        feel his greatness by fighting with him.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou drank some water as he told a lie.

    </p>
    <p>He started thinking about Ayanokouji’s fight with Housen.

    </p>
    <p>Ayanokouji was not afraid to face Housen, who Sudou could not even touch.

    </p>
    <p>He was not afraid of being stabbed with a knife, and handled the situation in a calm way.

    </p>
    <p>He had witnessed enough to make him realize that he could not win in a real fight.

    </p>
    <p>The fact that he was speaking from his real emotions gave his words a sense of truth, and Maezono seemed to be
        convinced.

    </p>
    <p>“Could it be that Karuizawa-san started dating Ayanokouji-kun because she realized that he is more high-spec than
        Hirata?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono, while both praising and showing amazement for Ayanokouji, did not hide her frank thoughts.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, I always wondered why Karuizawa was dating Ayanokouji too.”

    </p>
    <p>The part he didn’t understand precisely because he hasn’t experienced Ayanokouji’s greatness up close recently.

    </p>
    <p>“I’d be convinced if Karuizawa saw through him and picked him for that.”

    </p>
    <p>This time however, a different emotion was also born in Sudou.

    </p>
    <p>If that were the case, there was no reason for him to go out of his way to make Karuizawa his girlfriend, Sudou
        thought.

    </p>
    <p>Aside from her appearance, her personality is definitely not to his liking.

    </p>
    <p>However, this is his own subjective opinion, so he held back from saying it here.

    </p>
    <p>“It's a pretty crazy evaluation, coming from Ken. I still don't understand it, even with you telling me.”

    </p>
    <p>Ike understood the meaning of the words, but still could not really feel it.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not so unreasonable. You have to actually experience it to understand it.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s true. How do you think we can understand his greatness, then?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono asked Sudou how they could get proof.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s… Y-Yeah, you could suddenly hit him from behind or something like that.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, no, no, that’s an ambush.”

    </p>
    <p>“You can’t even hit him with an ambush.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m telling you I can do it. I’m a coward, so I won’t, but still.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you gonna try it from the front, then? The possibility is 0%, you know, 0.”

    </p>
    <p>“Who knows? I’m pretty confident in my fighting ability.”

    </p>
    <p>Ike stood up and put out his right and left fists in turns.

    </p>
    <p>He was puffing and making noises with his mouth with each strike, but his moves were clumsy.

    </p>
    <p>“You’ve never been in a fight, have you?”

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara said in a fed up tone, and urged him to sit down to stop the embarrassment.

    </p>
    <p>“S-Shut up. I don’t bully weak people.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, sure.”
    </p>
    <p>“Well, let’s leave the fight aside. If that’s true, I hope Ayanokouji goes all out. The class will be safe and
        sound if that happens, and maybe even go up to Class A, right?”

    </p>
    <p>It will be a positive thing for the class if he can make a significant contribution in terms of Academic Ability
        and Physical Ability.

    </p>
    <p>Ike said that the situation will become better than it is now.

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. He’s a classmate, so we should definitely ask him for help if he’s going to cooperate.”

    </p>
    <p>Wang said that they must ask for help if there is a strong helper in class.

    </p>
    <p>“I agree. Let’s try talking directly with him when the winter vacation is over.”

    </p>
    <p>There would normally be no opposition to this, and so Shinohara immediately agreed with that statement.

    </p>
    <p>The expectations for Ayanokouji are heating up.

    </p>
    <p>This is what Matsushita had always hoped for, but he was also keenly aware that he should not make a big mistake.

    </p>
    <p>“Wait, I understand that you want to rely on Ayanokouji and that you’d feel more reassured, but I don’t think you
        should say that in public or try to force him.”

    </p>
    <p>“Why? He’s not going to be forward-looking if we don’t say anything.”

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara complained that they should not let him go back to being a gloomy student in the shadows.

    </p>
    <p>“That might be true, but we have to think about why he’s been so meek up until now.”

    </p>
    <p>She gently warned the students who were heating up that they should try to infer Ayanokouji’s feelings.

    </p>
    <p>Sudou, who had been listening for a while, was getting used to the idea so he interrupted with an intentional
        cough to get the others’ attention.

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. If he hated standing out this much, it might have the opposite effect if we try to force him.”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm. It would be a loss if he becomes uncooperative, wouldn’t it? He’s probably willing to lend a hand, just
        like how he answered all the questions correctly on the Special Test earlier.”

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara and the others seemed to sense the risks associated with the approach of forcibly dragging Ayanokouji
        into the limelight.

    </p>
    <p>“I also agree. It would be a different story if he was someone like Kouenji-kun, who you can’t leave alone, but
        he’s not that type. For now, I think we should approach him like we always have.”

    </p>
    <p>Onodera spoke to Matsushita and Sudou with firm agreement and reasoning as a final reminder.

    </p>
    <p>For now, eight people came to an understanding at this gathering.

    </p>
    <p>Ayanokouji has more ability than what the OAA says, and although they expect him to show off his ability in the
        future, they should not rush him.

    </p>
    <p>However, Maezono alone, the planner of the gathering, had something completely different in mind.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you all really okay with that?”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“I also understand that Ayanokouji was a great student, but I think that’s why he’s scary… or weird. I mean… He
        designated Sakura for expulsion, someone he was close with and who was in the same group as him, didn’t he?
        Ayanokouji-kun also gave Kushida-san the final push… I think he can expel anyone from our class if he wants to.”

    </p>
    <p>The group was eager to talk.

    </p>
    <p>It had already been over an hour since they had gathered, and in that time, students had come in and out of the
        cafe one by one.

    </p>
    <p>One student who had been there for several minutes before Wang, the first of the group to show up at the cafe,
        also stood up from his seat while clutching his long-empty drink cup.

    </p>
    <p>“That was a decision that had to be made. Our class had no chance to win without picking someone to expel, thanks
        to the choices Kushida made. It makes sense that he chose the expulsion based on the OAA without considering
        personal feelings.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou immediately refuted, and everyone including Ike opened their eyes wide.

    </p>
    <p>“What, did I say something weird?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono showed confusion towards Sudou’s flustered reaction.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t know if I’d call it weird…”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita continued after that.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s because I can feel your intelligence in the way you’ve been talking and expressing yourself. People really
        do grow up, don’t they?”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?”

    </p>
    <p>“I mean, you couldn’t use phrases like ‘personal feelings’ or ‘makes sense’ in the old days, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, I think so.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, come on, it’s just normal. How stupid do you think I am?”

    </p>
    <p>Onodera looked happy, as if she was the one being praised.

    </p>
    <p>“Stop making fun of me. Err, where were we? Yeah, I don’t think Ayanokouji is a bad guy or anything like that.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou was embarrassed after being praised, and quickly changed the subject.

    </p>
    <p>“I know that too. That was a test where we certainly had to expel someone. Still, how should I put this… You
        remember his exchange with Kushida-san before that, don’t you? How he mercilessly drove her to the wall? So
        dispassionately… Like a machine, wouldn’t you say?”

    </p>
    <p>“He had to be cold-hearted in that situation, it’s not like Ayanokouji did that because he wanted to.”

    </p>
    <p>Sudou continued defending Ayanokouji to the end.

    </p>
    <p>“If something like that happens again, are we going to let Ayanokouji make another emotionless decision?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not like we have to rely on him alone, but isn’t it best to make objective decisions?”

    </p>
    <p>“Objective, huh? Is that what you all think is best?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono indirectly sent her gaze towards Ike and Shinohara.

    </p>
    <p>The students who are ranked the lowest in the OAA.

    </p>
    <p>A premonition of the future regarding Ayanokouji’s next candidates to be expelled.

    </p>
    <p>“Well, yeah, I think it’s true that Ayanokouji’s approach is a little problematic. It’s a great ability to have a
        lot of friends, and I wish he would take that into consideration too. Sakki’s gonna cry if I get expelled, so
        that wouldn’t be efficient, would it?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’d hate that.”

    </p>
    <p>Shinohara clung to Ike’s arm and did not let go.

    </p>
    <p>“There is also the precedent of Hasebe-san, who has been suffering from the effects for a long time…”

    </p>
    <p>Wang’s expression became clouded in light of this recent fact.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m still fine with things as they are, but… I definitely think we should avoid a future where Ayanokouji-kun
        becomes the class leader.”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono decisively said so after a long discussion.

    </p>
    <p>The unease that she could not see in her own mind was put into words.

    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokouji’s never going to become the leader, is he? That’s not even in his personality.”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think we can be sure of that. If he has the ability, I think he can also be recognized as the leader of
        the class.”

    </p>
    <p>“I would welcome it. If he really has that kind of ability, then he can become the leader.”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, who prides herself on her excellence, believes that it would be ideal for Ayanokouji to take the lead
        in the class later on.

    </p>
    <p>While lower-ranked students have to fear that they will be cut off, the upper-ranked students have the security
        of knowing they would never be expelled if they are at the top of the class and do not act in a way that would
        disrupt the leadership.

    </p>
    <p>However, Horikita, the current leader, is different.

    </p>
    <p>The probability of being affected by her emotions is not zero, and one does not know for what reason they might
        be cut off.

    </p>
    <p>She feels that she cannot let her guard down.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m adamantly against Ayanokouji becoming the leader.”

    </p>
    <p>“What do you think would be best then, Maezono-san?”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita wanted to find out what Maezono thinks about this matter.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s…”

    </p>
    <p>She hurriedly tried to react, but she was at a loss for words, as if she did not have a clear answer of her own.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you saying that if I don’t know the answer to that, I should be fine with anything?”

    </p>
    <p>Then, she forced herself to get away with an answer to escape.

    </p>
    <p>“Anyway, I don’t think we can get an answer even if we discuss Ayanokouji’s ideas here. Besides, no matter what
        anyone here says, Horikita-san is the leader of the class right now. We have to have her present if we want to
        go deeper into this conversation.”

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita delivered her stern statement in as soft a tone as possible.

    </p>
    <p>It’s not like she wants to get in an argument with Maezono, nor did she want to focus on herself in the
        discussion at this point.

    </p>
    <p>What she needed to do now was to get everyone’s attention, and impede Ayanokouji from taking action to improve
        the class.

    </p>
    <p>Matsushita understood why Ike and the others were scared of being judged cold-headedly, but that had nothing to
        do with Matsushita.

    </p>
    <p class="italic">She added in her mind, I’m sorry.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s true, but… Maybe we’ll see something if we try talking?”

    </p>
    <p>Maezono still seemed reluctant to end the discussion, but the topic soon shifted to the events of Christmas Eve.

    </p>
