    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        From Keyaki Mall, they took their time to walk slowly along the path where they could view the sea, and returned
        back to the vicinity around Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>Three men walking around at random during the winter vacation would not normally attract any attention.

    </p>
    <p>However, this group of Ryuen, who easily attracts attention, the advisor Katsuragi, and someone so different like
        me walking around together has a risk of drawing attention from the surroundings.

    </p>
    <p>Even so, Ryuen did not choose to do this anonymously, like in an indoor facility or by telephone.

    </p>
    <p>Somewhat careless, given the contents which are related to special tests.

    </p>
    <p>One’s assessment of it will be different depending on whether they judge it as carelessness or a contrived act.

    </p>
    <p>“I take it our chat is over? I don’t think we’re going to reach an agreement.”

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi stopped and confirmed this when their meeting place came into view.

    </p>
    <p>The number of special tests and their contents are impossible to guess, and Katsuragi will not allow Ryuen’s wish
        to fight against Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>We’re not going to do anything meaningful even if we continue to dribble out time like this.

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, I guess so. Enough of this, then.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen raised his left hand and said so without even turning back.

    </p>
    <p>“In any case, I’m gonna look after you Ayanokoji. Let me know if you’re in any trouble. I’ll help you out if it’s
        not about a class fight.”

    </p>
    <p>I gratefully nodded to his consideration which opposed his manners, and Katsuragi started walking ahead. I should
        get going as well.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m gonna stop by Keyaki Mall now. What are you going to do? I’ll consider it if you wanna hold hands and have a
        date.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen grinned and offered his left hand in a welcoming way.

    </p>
    <p>Leaving Katsuragi aside, going shopping with the two of us would raise a lot of attention.

    </p>
    <p>There’s a high chance Kei and Satou are in the mall.

    </p>
    <p>“Excuse me.”

    </p>
    <p>I’m not in the mood to have a hand-holding date with Ryuen, so I’ll go straight home.

    </p>
    <p>It didn’t look like he was going to stop me, so I continued walking.

    </p>
    <p>“We’re going to have our match when we’re in Year Three. Don’t forget that.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen sent me these last words as he disappeared towards Keyaki Mall’s direction.

    </p>
    <p>I’ve never forgotten it, but whether it will happen or not is another story.

    </p>
    <p>Still… We just walked a little, but I feel strangely tired.

    </p>
    <p>It’s probably not just my imagination that I feel even more tired now than when I sweat for an hour in the gym.

    </p>
    <p>I started walking when both Katsuragi and Ryuen disappeared.

    </p>
    <p>I should return to my dorm and spend the day in my room as planned.

    </p>
    <p>However, there's something I want to check first.

    </p>
    <p>I stopped after walking for a few dozen seconds when I felt that I was close to it.

    </p>
    <p>I am in front of a vending machine set up along the outer wall of Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>I stared at the products on display, and to someone else, I’m sure it would look like I’m simply considering
        whether to buy a drink.

    </p>
    <p>I looked at the decorative plant, which was probably put out there by an employee at the opening of the shop.

    </p>
    <p>“What are you doing there?”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh!?”
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 9.5/Images/image7.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        I called out to Yamamura, who was trying to hide in my blind spot in the shadows.

    </p>
    <p>“You’ve been following me for ten minutes, right? You were also hiding behind a tree by the road on the other
        side just now.”

    </p>
    <p>The road lined with several thick-trunked trees made it easy to hide.

    </p>
    <p>It’s an impressive feat that she avoided being detected by Ryuen and Katsuragi while moving.

    </p>
    <p>“N-No, that’s not…”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura tried to dodge the question, but she seems to have noticed that I even correctly guessed her position.

    </p>
    <p>“How… How did you know?”

    </p>
    <p>“How?”

    </p>
    <p>It was easy enough to find her, but I suppose I wouldn’t have worried about her presence if it was the past me.

    </p>
    <p>Since we spent time together on the school trip, she is now in my consciousness.

    </p>
    <p>An image, if I was to express it in an example.

    </p>
    <p>When your brain learns that image A appears like image B when you change your viewpoint, it continues to perceive
        it as image B.

    </p>
    <p>It may be similar to this.

    </p>
    <p>I knew that she followed me and heard a part of our conversation, but I didn’t stop her.

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura is an A Class student, and an ally of Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>If she was doing this under the radar, it would be a form of support for me to tell Ryuen and Katsuragi about it.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, I was free to do so, but I don’t think it’s a good idea at the moment.

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t worry, I don’t think Ryuen or Katsuragi noticed.”

    </p>
    <p>“Really? It felt like Ryuen-kun was trying to bait me out, though….”

    </p>
    <p>I could say that her instincts are correct.

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen intentionally walked us around and around without stopping at one spot.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps he was waiting for his prey to be caught in a trap.

    </p>
    <p>It could be that Yamamura was coincidentally drawn into this invitation.

    </p>
    <p>“Why do you need to ask me if you’ve been exposed or not, then?”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura was certain that she wasn’t exposed to anyone.

    </p>
    <p>Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been surprised when she saw me.

    </p>
    <p>“I suppose you’ve been tailing him before today as well.”

    </p>
    <p>She didn’t affirm it, but her silence did.

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura did an excellent job at tailing us, even though we were being cautious.

    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Ryuen must have had no choice but to give up when he realized that his lure was not going to
        bring results.

    </p>
    <p>It didn’t look like Ryuen was coming this way after we separated either.

    </p>
    <p>That’s also why I could call out to Yamamura without worry.

    </p>
    <p>“I was a bit hesitant to call out to you, but we were in the same group on the school trip, and I figured I
        should at least say hello.”

    </p>
    <p>From my point of view, it would be as if I was ignoring Yamamura if I didn’t call out to her after I noticed her.

    </p>
    <p>I suppose that for Yamamura, she judged that she was found out by me, and would have preferred me to ignore her,
        but…
    </p>
    <p>
        “Aren’t you going to ask… why I was following you?”

    </p>
    <p>It’s confirmed that they’re going to clash at the final test, and Ryuen wants to fight Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure Sakayanagi wants to gather information about Ryuen.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t need to ask.”

    </p>
    <p>“Is, is that so?”

    </p>
    <p>“Also, I’m not going to tell Ryuen about you, so don’t worry.”

    </p>
    <p>I figured that the fact that those two didn’t notice her wouldn’t be enough to put her at ease, so I added this
        on.

    </p>
    <p>“You seemed pretty comfortable with them, though. At the very least, you don’t recognize them as enemies. In
        other words, aren’t you an ally of Ryuen?”

    </p>
    <p>There’s suspicion mixed in with her voice.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry to say this, but I’m no ally of Ryuen. I’m not on the side of A Class either, though. Anyway I don’t
        intend on telling anyone about our meeting here. You can trust me on that.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Really?”

    </p>
    <p>I was about to nod my head to allay her fears, but I stopped after I heard faint footsteps. They were slow, and
        repeated a few times.

    </p>
    <p>“Impressive, Ayanokoji. You found the rat.”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura was already no longer looking at me, and it was instead Ryuen at the end of her gaze.

    </p>
    <p>I thought that Ryuen was already gone, but I suppose that was on purpose.

    </p>
    <p>“Did that damn Sakayanagi ask people to gather information about me?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s not like that…”

    </p>
    <p>She’s definitely not a good performer, and her denial isn’t convincing.

    </p>
    <p>“Heh. I guess I did the right thing to chase after Ayanokoji just for caution’s sake. You’re pretty sensitive to
        other presences around you, aren’t you?”

    </p>
    <p>That’s right. I was confident that I would notice Ryuen or anyone else if I was followed, but it looks like Ryuen
        was also already aware of this.

    </p>
    <p>From the point we dispersed, I only had two routes to choose from: the direct route to Keyaki Mall, or the road
        leading to the school and the dormitory.

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen actually disappeared into Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>Then, he waited for a while not to reveal himself, and quickly followed me from a distance I wouldn’t notice.

    </p>
    <p>No matter how cautious I am, I have no way of detecting anyone if there isn’t anyone following me.

    </p>
    <p>He said something to make sure I wouldn’t go to Keyaki Mall and forced me into this route.

    </p>
    <p>Moreover, I even felt sorry for Yamamura when I saw Katsuragi coming back from the front.

    </p>
    <p>“I didn’t think you and Sakayanagi had any common points, Yamamura.”

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi looked surprised to notice Yamamura scouting them.

    </p>
    <p>So he was here to make it look like he left and bring out into the open the person searching the surroundings.

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry, Ayanokoji. I just came back after Ryuen contacted me a few minutes ago.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen must have thought that bringing in Katsuragi would increase his chances in chasing me.

    </p>
    <p>Did Ryueen keep quiet even to his ally in order to not let me perceive what was going on?

    </p>
    <p>“Is it surprising that this girl is connected with Sakayanagi?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. At the very least, it never looked like she had any connection to Sakayanagi to me in my time at this
        school. I think that she’s just one person in her many spy units, though.”

    </p>
    <p>I suppose that’s something Katsuragi can understand well, since he used to be on the inside.

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura is clearly a lot more worried now than before.

    </p>
    <p>“I went to all that trouble of catching you, but it’s just one tiny fish. I thought that Hashimoto was on the
        move. Or, did Sakayanagi leave this to you because she trusts you?”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen’s deep suspicious gaze shot through Yamamura.

    </p>
    <p>She didn’t expect to be in a situation where she would be surrounded, so she couldn’t hide the anxiety on her
        face.

    </p>
    <p>This then prevented her from coming up with an answer to Ryuen.

    </p>
    <p>“Still, your power of observation is pretty high, Ayanokoji. Your job’s over for today, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen declared that he was no longer interested in me, and that his target was now the terrified Yamamura.

    </p>
    <p>“Sakayanagi’s wrong if she thinks she can defeat me by sniffing around me like this.”

    </p>
    <p>Even if I did not find Yamamura here, and if she was able to continue gathering information, whether or not she
        would be able to pass on anything useful to Sakayangi is a different matter.

    </p>
    <p>If you’re doing something that you don’t want anyone to know about, you of course would not do it outdoors.

    </p>
    <p>It would be in the room of a trusted friend, a karaoke room, or a bathroom of the same gender. It would be easy
        to use different rooms for different purposes and proceed in secrecy.

    </p>
    <p>However, Sakayanagi has no choice about some things.

    </p>
    <p>Information is necessary, so I’m sure Ryuen is also looking into A Class.

    </p>
    <p>Unlike Ryuen though, who can gather information on his own, Sakayanagi has some difficulty in that regard.

    </p>
    <p>She has to use students like Yamamura, Kamimuro and Hashimoto to gather information for her.

    </p>
    <p>“It feels pretty bad to have someone spy on you.”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you sure you can say that? I’m sure you’re also spying on Sakayanagi, right?”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like this isn’t a one-way act of observation from Sakayanagi’s side.

    </p>
    <p>Since we’re already headed for the finals, both sides seem to be spying on each other.

    </p>
    <p>“Should we use a different method, then? Tell me if you have any ingenious ideas, Katsuragi.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen suggested that he would make a move against Sakayanagi, but Katsuragi denied it.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not gonna make any big moves. The only thing we can do for now is to observe Sakayanagi.”

    </p>
    <p>Both sides are keeping their distance and just glaring at each other.

    </p>
    <p>It looks like Katsuragi thinks this is the best thing to do.

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t forget that we’re going to conclude things with the final test, and not outside of it.”

    </p>
    <p>“Pfft. You’re a really thickheaded guy.”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen and Katsuragi’s fundamental policies are complete opposites, but Ryuen gladly accepted Katsuragi’s speech
        and conduct and smiled.

    </p>
    <p>“Should we make her hang out with us for a bit?”

    </p>
    <p>“Stop it.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh? Stop? After we caught her? It’s a waste if we don’t cook her up, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you going to threaten her? We should just be glad we noticed her presence. You should leave now, Yamamura.”

    </p>
    <p>Saying so, Katsuragi signaled for Yamamura to quickly leave.

    </p>
    <p>“E-Excuse me…”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura wanted to quickly leave this uncomfortable situation.

    </p>
    <p>“Wait.”

    </p>
    <p>“!?”

    </p>
    <p>However, Ryuen did not allow it, and she froze up like a frog being stared at by a snake.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m gonna stay quiet about us noticing you.”

    </p>
    <p>“Why?”

    </p>
    <p>“Because I pity you. I don’t need to say what’s going to happen to you if it comes out that we noticed you,
        right? Your value isn’t going to disappear if we don’t report this. Well, it’s up to you whether you believe me
        or not.”

    </p>
    <p>Saying that, Ryuen dangled a thread of salvation to Yamamura.

    </p>
    <p>“If you can’t keep quiet about this, tell her this. If she wants information about me, she can come to my room
        alone any time she wants. If you and that woman have the courage to do that, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Yamamura faintly nodded and headed towards Keyaki Mall to exit through there. After she left, Katsuragi
        approached Ryuen.

    </p>
    <p>“Ryuen, you bastard.”

    </p>
    <p>“What?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not gonna praise you for what you just did.”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not gonna tell you not to be interested in the opposite gender, but Sakayanagi is a kid. You can’t put your
        hands on her.”

    </p>
    <p>I wondered what Katsuragi was about to say with such a serious face, and he made a warning.

    </p>
    <p>This is his interpretation of Ryuen inviting Sakayanagi to his room.

    </p>
    <p>That was just a joke of Ryuen, but I guess Katsuragi doesn’t get that.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s a lot of girls in this school. Don’t do anything rash.”

    </p>
    <p>“What the fuck are you talking about, you idiot? You think I’m going to get turned on by a cocky little brat like
        that? It was obviously just a simple provocation.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hm? No, but you just said that she should visit you alone. Isn’t that what you meant?”

    </p>
    <p>Ryuen shook his head in dismay and started arguing with Katsuragi.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m definitely not interested in her, but Sakayanagi’s the same age as me, isn’t she?”

    </p>
    <p>The contradiction is that Katsuragi implied it would be okay to mess with someone of his own age, but not with
        Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi, who had not noticed this, froze in thought for a moment.

    </p>
    <p>Then, he finally understood the meaning of Ryuen’s statement and started moving.

    </p>
    <p>“...Indeed. No, but with that size, she definitely looks younger than us. She’s even shorter than my sister,
        and-”

    </p>
    <p>Although he is aware of her as a strong enemy, Katsuragi is also a big brother.

    </p>
    <p>I suppose his sense of justice got the best of him when he thought about his sister and the possibility of her
        being a sexual target.

    </p>
    <p>One thing is for sure, Sakayanagi will be angry if she hears these two’s words.

    </p>
    <p>He’s clearly treating her like a child (only her outward appearance, though.)

    </p>
    <p>“I only like normal girls. I don’t like them gaudy, or plain, and neither tall nor short.”

    </p>
    <p>I definitely didn’t want to know, but it looks like Ryuen’s type is very normal.

    </p>
    <p>Rather than a random desire, it sounds like a conclusion based on both sour and sweet experiences.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t know what his high school life is like now, but I’m sure he had a lot of fun with girls in middle school.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m relieved you didn’t fall as far as I thought you did.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like Katsuragi is relieved about something completely unrelated.

    </p>
    <p>“So? You still want something from me, Ayanokoji?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s pretty cruel to say after conveniently using me like that.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s your fault for getting used. If you’re gonna blame something, blame that wild intuition of yours.”

    </p>
    <p>Indeed, there’s no point holding a grudge against him for getting one over me here.

    </p>
    <p>I’m not sure how I can use this as a lesson for the future, though.

    </p>
    <p>A type of following where you purposefully don’t follow after the person.

    </p>
    <p>It’s difficult to prevent him from taking the same approach again.

    </p>
    <p>Being cautious despite not feeling anyone’s presence would just limit my movements.

    </p>
    <p>It would be even more draining to assume that I’m being followed every time.

    </p>
    <p>Well, there’s no point in remaining here.

    </p>
    <p>Besides, I still have some things I want to talk to Yamamura about, so I might be able to catch up with her if I
        leave now.

    </p>
    <p>“Weren’t you going back?”

    </p>
    <p>The moment I started heading towards Keyaki Mall, that’s what I heard.

    </p>
    <p>“There are numerous routes inside the mall. I don’t want you to keep following me any more today.”

    </p>
    <p>I warned him that I had many paths of escape, and Ryuen laughed with his nose.
    </p>
