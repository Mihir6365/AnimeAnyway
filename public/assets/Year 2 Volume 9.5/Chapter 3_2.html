    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        On the same day, each student was working on his or her own agenda.

    </p>
    <p>I, who had no way of knowing this, was also spending the day with an unusual group of students.

    </p>
    <p>Christmas had passed, and it was the 26th.

    </p>
    <p>This is also known as the day of the year when cakes sell the least.

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that there was a time when today was known as a day when cakes don’t
        sell.

    </p>
    <p>I have various theories, but one of them is that Christmas has passed.

    </p>
    <p>After Christmas, Japanese people quickly start focusing on the New Year.

    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, there seems to be a custom of eating cake all year round, but this is still a day of the year when it’s
        hard to sell them.

    </p>
    <p>That is why, in recent years, there have been more than a few people who buy cakes on the 26th on purpose to get
        a discount on the half-price cakes and such.

    </p>
    <p>I didn’t pay attention to it when I woke up in the morning and thought that I would be spending the whole day in
        my room.

    </p>
    <p>Because the day when Kei should be recovering is getting closer.

    </p>
    <p>Her fever has gone down, and she is now able to move around a little bit.

    </p>
    <p>If Kei wants to restore her relationship with me, I’m fine with going back to the way things were before.

    </p>
    <p>My room is clean enough, but there’s still going to be dust and dirt in places I can’t see.

    </p>
    <p>I’m going to thoroughly wipe everything down and clean my room today.

    </p>
    <p>I prepared my cleaning supplies in advance and laid them out on the table.

    </p>
    <p>Now, the battle begins.

    </p>
    <p>Thus began my solitary battle from this morning.

    </p>
    <p>I moved the furniture, wiped it all down with a rag, and thoroughly sterilized with alcohol.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, once the rooms were finished, it was time for the toilet, the bathroom, and the closets.

    </p>
    <p>The sun was already setting by the time I was finished with the kitchen.

    </p>
    <p>It wasn’t snowing at the moment, but there was still no sign of the snow melting.

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe a leftover christmas cake?”

    </p>
    <p>The 26th will soon be over.

    </p>
    <p>Most of the cakes that were not sold today will be discarded because of the expiration dates.

    </p>
    <p>Maybe I should go check if they’re selling them for cheap?

    </p>
    <p>I don’t want a whole one, but I might buy some pieces if they’re selling them cut.

    </p>
    <p>So, I decided to head for Keyaki Mall while looking at the sun going down.
