    <h3>Part 5</h3>
    <p>
        We separated with the 3 from A class after the cafe, before going to the bookstore.

    </p>
    <p>From how frantic they seemed, it was probably a call from Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>The two of us stopped by a bookstore on the way home and exchanged various opinions.

    </p>
    <p>“It was a very fun day, wasn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>Walking a little ahead of me at dusk, Hiyori gave me a small laugh, thinking about the day’s events.

    </p>
    <p>“I didn’t think Kitou-kun was someone who talked that much.”

    </p>
    <p>“That much?”

    </p>
    <p>Looking back, I think he only muttered something 5 or 6 times, so…

        “Other than that, I also learned a lot about Kamuro-san and Hashimoto-kun.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m glad you had a good time. In the end, I couldn’t really do anything for you, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s not true. We went to the bookstore together, didn’t we? That by itself was plenty of fun for me.”

    </p>
    <p>“Really? Well, I’m glad you were happy.”

    </p>
    <p>I haven’t yet improved in the area of making plans with the other person in mind.

    </p>
    <p>Regardless of gender, this is something I need to get more experience with.

    </p>
    <p>Before I knew it, we started talking less and both became quiet.

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori started walking more slowly, so she might be thinking about something.

    </p>
    <p>We walked along the tree-lined street until we were about halfway to the dormitory.

    </p>
    <p>“Umm… Ayanokouji-kun. I wanna ask you something, but don’t get mad, okay?”

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori, who was smiling happily until just a moment ago, looked just a little nervous now.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think I’m gonna get mad, so let’s hear it.”

    </p>
    <p>“The book I gifted you the other day… My father is the author.”

    </p>
    <p>“Your father? Ah, I see. So the author’s writer name is based on his real name?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s amazing. You figured it out?”

    </p>
    <p>“His unusual name rang a bell now that I know he’s your relative.”

    </p>
    <p>“Shiina Katsumi. That’s my father’s name.”

    </p>
    <p>“So, I see that your love of books came from your father.”

    </p>
    <p>I may have caught a glimpse of the background that gave birth to this literature girl.

    </p>
    <p>“I haven’t told anyone else that my father is an author. It’s partly because I never had a friend that liked the
        same things as me, but… It’s not just that. I wanted you to know about it.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s not as if she was hiding it, but she didn’t go out of her way to tell anyone about it either.

    </p>
    <p>I wonder why she’s talking about it now?

    </p>
    <p>“What do you imagine the battle ahead will be like? I know that it’s hard to predict, of course, but is it okay
        if I ask for your opinion?”

    </p>
    <p>“I think Ryuuen and Sakayanagi’s battle is going to change things a lot in the future. Assuming that the class
        points will be transferred as a result like usual, A Class will be in a very superior position if Sakayanagi
        wins. That may disappear if Ryuuen wins, though. I think more attention should be paid to that than Horikita’s
        or Ichiniose’s class.”

    </p>
    <p>Anyone can guess as much.

    </p>
    <p>I need to think beyond that future to express my opinions further as she asked.

    </p>
    <p>“I think most students would think Sakayanagi’s class has the advantage.”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. She’s been maintaining the A Class for almost two years now, and she’s never lost a large amount of class
        points. I think there’s a lot of people in our class already afraid of the end-term special test.”

    </p>
    <p>If they lose, the Ryuuen class will have very little chance of graduating as A Class.

    </p>
    <p>“As long as we don’t know the contents of the special test, we can only make judgements based on the strength and
        affinity of each leader and their classmates, but I think Ryuuen also has a good chance to win.”

    </p>
    <p>In fact, I see that as the ideal result for me.

    </p>
    <p>The outcome of the battle between Horikita and Ichinose can go either way, but Hiyori’s class will lose all
        chances of winning and drop out of the competition if Ryuuen loses.

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah.”

    </p>
    <p>As a member of that class, Hiyori also strongly feels this way.

    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi’s class is strong.

    </p>
    <p>That’s precisely why it will be an unfathomable loss if they lose.

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry for asking about this.”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t mind. I’m glad you care about your class too.”

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori looked just a little embarrassed after I said that.

    </p>
    <p>“We’re in different classes, so we’re going to be competing against each other, but… Let’s graduate together,
        okay?”

    </p>
    <p>Hiyori surprisingly walked out in front of me.

    </p>
    <p>Then, she turned around with a shy expression and said so.

<p>
We don’t know which class is going to graduate as A Class.

</p><p>However, there’s no reason to fight and hate the other classes because of that.

</p><p>Students want to graduate together with their friends, close friends and lovers with a smile. 

</p><p>“Yeah, of course.”

</p><p>Hiyori gently smiled when I replied in agreement.

</p><p>The winter break is ending. The cold wind is blowing.

</p><p>It’s probably going to get even colder towards the end of this month.

</p><p>Then, the third term will be here.
