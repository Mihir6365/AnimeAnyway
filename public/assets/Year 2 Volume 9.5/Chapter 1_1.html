    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        Inside Keyaki Mall in the
        forenoon, the
        atmosphere of Christmas Eve was in
        full swing.
    </p>
    <p>Inside the mall was decorated with even more gaudy ornaments than at the
        entrance.
    </p>
    <p>There seems to be a high ratio of male and female couples among the
        clientele spending time here.
    </p>
    <p>As I also told Ichinose, I entered the gym I joined the other day.
    </p>
    <p>I finished checking in at the reception while thinking that there could be no one
        else here.
    </p>
    <p>I changed into my sportswear and entered the training room, but it wasn’t
        empty after all.
    </p>
    <p>There are boys, girls and even adults around.
    </p>
    <p>The character who draws my attention most is the person about to start bench
        pressing.
    </p>
    <p>It was the homeroom teacher of Year-Two A Class, Mashima-sensei.
    </p>
    <p>He has a large, muscled physique, and his sportswear is very suitable for him.
    </p>
    <p>“Good morning Mashima-sensei.”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm? Ayanokoji? Were you a gym student too?”</p>
    <p>
        I called out to him when he was about to lay down on the bench, and he</p>
    <p>
        replied so with a little surprise.
    </p>
    <p>“I joined just a little while ago.”</p>
    <p>
        “Oh, really? That’s great to hear, welcome”</p>
    <p>
        For some reason, Mashima-sensei happily nodded, as if he was approving

        one of his students for passing an exam.
    </p>
    <p>He’s making a pretty big deal out of just one of his students joining the gym.
    </p>
    <p>“What made you join, though?”</p>
    <p>
        “I felt that my physical strength was diminishing compared to before, so I
        wanted to get it back.”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s not a very student-like reason, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        “I don’t know if I will continue for long, though.”</p>
    <p>
        “You should. I also started training after thinking about some things, but it’s
        actually turned into my daily routine now. It wouldn’t be a bad thing to sweat it
        out at the same place as your teacher.”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei seems very welcoming, maybe because he’s more excited
        than usual right now.
    </p>
    <p>“Also, I’ll commend you for going to the gym on your first day of the winter
        vacation.”</p>
    <p>
        “Do you have any plans for Christmas’ Eve today?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm? No, unfortunately, I’m planning on sweating it out in the gym the whole
        day.”</p>
    <p>
        He replied without any ambiguity. That’s what I thought, but…</p>
    <p>
        “Probably.”</p>
    <p>
        Probably.
    </p>
    <p>Why did he add on such an expression, even though he’s talking about
        himself?
    </p>
    <p>“Is something going on?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, nothing. So, you just started, right? You probably don’t know much here.”</p>
    <p>
        “Well, yes.”</p>
    <p>
        I don’t think I’ll have any problems with the equipment, but I’ll refrain from
        making any unnecessary remarks.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that as a newcomer, it would be more fun to act like I really am a
        newcomer, on the premise that I don’t know anything.
    </p>
    <p>Now, I should also start———</p>
    <p>
        “Alright.”</p>
    <p>
        “Alright?”</p>
    <p>
        “This is a great opportunity. You can watch how I train for a while.”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh? Oh, okay…”</p>
    <p>
        I was about to start training myself, but Mashima-sensei stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei laid down on the bench and put the bar at eye level with
        himself.
    </p>
    <p>He lightly put it up and down a few times, and put the safety bars a little higher
        than his chest.
    </p>
    <p>“Never forget the safety bars while doing a bench press. They’ll save you from
        getting crushed.”</p>
    <p>
        “Thank you.”</p>
    <p>
        I kept watching, unable to tell him that I knew.
    </p>
    <p>It feels awkward not to say anything, though, so I should ask him something.
    </p>
    <p>“How much can you lift?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hmm… I’m going to do 80 kg this time, but I can do up to 100 kg. They say
        that only one in a hundred people can do that.”</p>
    <p>
        He doesn’t have a confident expression, but his tone of voice is overflowing
        with pride.
    </p>
    <p>He put strength into his muscles and flexed.
    </p>
    <p>I’ve never heard of anything like that, but I do wonder if it’s true. It sounds like
        a cheap line that just gets repeated by everyone.
    </p>
    <p>“You’ll break your body if you push yourself too far, though. It’s not like the
        movies where you just lift once and it’s over, your chest muscles get better by
        repeating numerous sets.”</p>
    <p>
        It sounds like he’s practised a lot from television, but he started putting it into
        action after saying that.
    </p>
    <p>I was in a state of emptiness as I was shown the man's breath and the sweat
        that was pouring out of him.
    </p>
    <p>I watched him for a while after that, and Mashima-sensei sat up after finishing
        3 sets.
    </p>
    <p>“Phew. Well, that’s how you do it.”</p>
    <p>
        “That was very helpful.”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s the most important thing. I’m planning on coming here 6 days a week
        except Thursdays even during the winter vacation. It will be midnight from the
        third term, but you can always rely on me if you have any problem.”</p>
    <p>
        That’s very specific. I suppose there’s something happening on Thursday, which he clearly excluded.
        </d>
    <p>“I can teach you the basics if you need me to, but———”</p>
    <p>
        “No, it’s okay. I wouldn’t want to take up your time, so I’m going to focus on
        coming here for a while and doing some light training.”</p>
    <p>
        I quickly declined and put precedence on getting away from this spot.
    </p>
    <p>“I see. Well, talk to me any time if you have any problems. I’ll be here as much
        as I can during the winter vacation.”</p>
    <p>
        After receiving these welcomed words from a teacher, I started to work out on
        my own.
    </p>
    <p>I continued training in the gym for about 30 minutes after that, and noticed the
        atmosphere in the gym change for just a moment.
    </p>
    <p>Because all of the students working out suddenly turned their eyes in my
        direction.
    </p>
    <p>I checked what they were looking at, and it was a person I was used to seeing
        from class, Koenji.
    </p>
    <p>He had a lot of attention on him, but he didn’t mind it, and started training.
    </p>
    <p>I thought they were looking at me for doing something unusual, but that
        doesn’t seem to be the case. I can just barely hear the male students near me
        talking.
    </p>
    <p>“Wow, that Koenji guy really is something else.”</p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, I don’t think any other high schoolers could do that…”</p>
    <p>
        His physical ability, unusual for high school students can be seen from his
        training in the gym, so it seems that people were looking at him because of his
        skill.
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, one can easily see the level of perfection of his physique from a
        glance.
    </p>
    <p>The mass of refined muscles, and his flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>He made no unnecessary movements, and there was a seriousness there that
        one would not imagine from his usual eccentric demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>When I think about it, I get the impression that Koenji has no qualms about
        training his body in various places.
    </p>
    <p>As such, it’s not strange in the least that he would be going to a gym, and
        rather I would say he is a very suitable man for it.
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei also stopped his hands to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>Objectively, one can easily say that Koenji is far past the level of a student.
    </p>
    <p>With his natural physique, he spares no effort in his daily training to maintain
        his body.
    </p>
    <p>I learned once again that Koenji is always in pursuit of fitness even in school,
    </p>
    <p>no matter the time or place.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike Mashima-sensei who is only slightly better than a beginner, Koenji
        displays training that is truly captivating.
    </p>
    <p>Further, let alone get anxious or lose his temper because of the attention, he
        is the type who flourishes under it.
    </p>
    <p>“koenji-kun’ always so popular.”</p>
    <p>
        Someone said those words to me, backing up the fact that getting attention is
        a usual thing for Koenji.
    </p>
    <p>“Good morning Ayanokoji-kun.”</p>
    <p>
        Then, she greeted me.
    </p>
    <p>“Hey.”</p>
    <p>
        “There’s a lot of rain again today, huh? By the way, when did you get here?”</p>
    <p>
        “About 30 minutes ago, I think.”</p>
    <p>
        “I see. I was planning on coming here around that time too actually, but I
        ended up chatting with a friend a little and got late.”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose said so standing next to me and staring at me from a close distance.
    </p>
    <p>“Pretty unfortunate, considering that today’s Christmas Eve, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “Well, it’s whatever. There’s no reason anywhere to consider this a special
        day.”</p>
    <p>
        “It may be different for girls though, you know?”</p>
    <p>
        “I see… I can’t deny that.”</p>
    <p>
        As long as I am a man, I can’t tell whether it’s men or women who cling onto
        special days more.
    </p>
    <p>After a light chat, Ichinose told me that she wanted me to run with her, so we
        lined up on two machines next to each other.
    </p>
    <p>We ran at our own pace for about 30 minutes without chatting after that.
    </p>
    <p>“You feel a lot more motivated when you’re doing this with someone else,
    </p>
    <p>don’t you?”</p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, I guess so. In that sense, it was the right thing to start with Amikura,
    </p>
    <p>huh?”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose laughed and wiped the sweat from her forehead with a towel.
    </p>
    <p>After that, I enjoyed the gym with Ichinose for around one more hour.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I told Ichinose that I will be leaving just as Amikura got here, so we
        separated as she went to chat with her.
    </p>
    <p>“Leaving already?”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei stopped training and called out to me when he saw me about
        to leave.
    </p>
    <p>He says ‘already’, but I think two hours is plenty long enough to be in the gym.
    </p>
    <p>“Yes. Well, I got tired. You know it’s been 2 hours, right, sensei?”</p>
    <p>
        “2 hours? Hm, I see. I never noticed.”</p>
    <p>
        Was he too engrossed in his training to take notice of the time?
    </p>
    <p>“I think you should rest a little more, Mashima-sensei. You kept going for
        around 3 hours without resting that much, right? Fatigue accumulates where
        you can’t see, and you might also get an injury.”</p>
    <p>
        Ready to be yelled at for trying to give advice as a newcomer, I gave him
        some words of advice.
    </p>
    <p>Then, he wasn’t angry but surprised, and crossed his arms.
    </p>
    <p>“...You may be right. I wanted to throw away my weakness and become a fine
        teacher, but it might have the opposite effect.”</p>
    <p>
        I suppose no one around gave Mashima-sensei advice like this until now.
    </p>
    <p>He wants results fast. He wants muscles.
    </p>
    <p>It seems he was so focused on that, that he forgot to even feel tired.
    </p>
    <p>“Alright. I’ll leave it here for today too.”</p>
    <p>
        Saying that, he earnestly took in my advice.
    </p>
    <p>“See you later, then.”</p>
    <p>
        I said my farewell and walked away, but Mashima-sensei quickly chased after
        me.
    </p>
    <p>“Is it alright if we chat a little?”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh? Of course.”</p>
    <p>
        I thought it would be related to the gym, but he invited me to the rest area
        instead.
    </p>
    <p>“Did I do something in the gym that bothered you, sensei?”</p>
    <p>
        I didn’t really understand why he called me here, so I asked him about it.
    </p>
    <p>“Of course not. It’s nothing like that, so don’t worry. You passed your time in
        the gym with no problems.”</p>
    <p>
        It feels like he didn’t watch me the whole time, though…</p>
    <p>
        He looked at my doubtful eyes and averted his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>“...I was too focused on my training to look around, I’ll honestly confess that.”</p>
    <p>
        He apologetically dropped his shoulders, perhaps sensing that I was seeing
        through him.
    </p>
    <p>That reaction makes me feel like I'm the one that did something bad.
    </p>
    <p>Teachers are on winter vacation too.
    </p>
    <p>They’re free to enjoy whatever they want on these grounds, and they don’t
        have to keep watch over the students.
    </p>
    <p>I ended up pulling an apology out of him by utilizing his responsibilities as an
        adult.
    </p>
    <p>“So, you wanted to talk with me..?”</p>
    <p>
        I tried to change the subject, and Mashima-sensei looked around just once to
        confirm that there was no one else around.
    </p>
    <p>“Actually, I have something to ask of you.”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh?”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei corrected his posture before continuing but was interrupted
        by a visitor.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a woman with long, wavy hair.
    </p>
    <p>A worker in the gym noticed us and approached smiling.
    </p>
    <p>“Mashima-san, you worked really hard again today, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, I really didn’t.”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei replied while greeting her.
    </p>
    <p>He’s been coming here longer than me, so I suppose they know his name.
    </p>
    <p>“This is..?”</p>
    <p>
        “His name is Ayanokoji. He’s an excellent student from B class, a different
        class than the one I’m in charge of.”</p>
    <p>
        He lightly tapped me on the back, telling me to introduce myself.
    </p>
    <p>At least he intended to, but his strikes are quite strong thanks to his muscles…
        “My name is Ayanokoji.”</p>
    <p>
        “We met at the reception desk a few times, didn’t we? You were with
        Ichinose-chan.”</p>
    <p>
        Impressive. It looks like even I left an impression on her, despite only coming
        here for a few days.
    </p>
    <p>“Ah, sorry, you’re resting. I just came here to get something I need, so excuse
        me.”</p>
    <p>
        She nodded in a well-mannered way, grabbed a few towels from an employee
        shelf and headed to the reception desk.
    </p>
    <p>Mashima–sensei continued looking at the woman until she disappeared,
        waiting to be left alone with me.
    </p>
    <p>……</p>
    <p>
        He’s not making any movements.
    </p>
    <p>“Sensei?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm, what, Ayanokoji?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, I mean… You wanted to talk to me about something, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “Oh, right. Well, I think we should do this next time.”</p>
    <p>
        “Okay? Well in that case, I’ll be taking my leave.”</p>
    <p>
        “Wait.”</p>
    <p>
        He grabbed my shoulders when I turned around.
    </p>
    <p>“...What now?”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei is a little strange today.
    </p>
    <p>His image as a quiet, calm teacher is getting cloudy.
    </p>
    <p>“I’ll confess that I think this is a stroke of luck.”</p>
    <p>
        “You’re confessing to a lot today, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        It looks like he’s finally getting to the point however, so I suppose I should be
        relieved.
    </p>
    <p>“That worker who was here just now, she’s Akiyama-san.”</p>
    <p>
        “I didn’t pay much attention, but she had a name tag. So?”</p>
    <p>
        “...I want you to look into her. As carefully and discreetly as you can.”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh?”</p>
    <p>
        I was about to turn around, but he’s holding my shoulders with such strength
        that it’s impossible.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>“I’ve never brought in a problem of the other gender into school up until now.

        However, the situation changed after I began going to the gym. I don’t have to
        say all the details for you to understand, do I?”</p>
    <p>
        “Well, I get what you’re trying to say. You have feelings towards this
        Akiyama-san, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “...You could say that too.”</p>
    <p>
        No, that’s the only thing I could say.
    </p>
    <p>“She has a child-like face somehow, but she’s also a proper, beautiful adult
        woman.”</p>
    <p>
        “Right…”</p>
    <p>
        She really is a beautiful adult woman, but that manner of speaking makes me
        feel a little uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>“What about Hoshinomiya-sensei or Chabashira-sensei? It’s not like romance
        between teachers is forbidden, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “It’s forbidden in the rules.”</p>
    <p>
        “Ah, I see. There’s probably teachers dating in secret, though.”</p>
    <p>
        “I’ll just say that I won’t say there aren’t. In the first place, those two would not
        be candidates even if it weren’t forbidden.”</p>
    <p>
        He said that in a very definitive way.
    </p>
    <p>“May I ask the reason?”</p>
    <p>
        “Sorry, but I’m not going to tell you. We’re teacher and student. That would be
        a useless conversation, wouldn’t it?”</p>
    <p>
        “I’ll be taking my leave, then. What we were talking about just now is useless
        as well, so.”</p>
    <p>
        “Hoshinomiya’s character isn’t serious enough. Chabashira’s character is too
        serious. That’s all.”</p>
    <p>
        A short but easy to understand reply came back from Mashima-sensei.
    </p>
    <p>Considering their reputations on equal terms, Hoshinomiya-sensei is a young
        maiden who falls in love often.
    </p>
    <p>I’m sure she would be flirty and continue her friendships with the opposite
        gender even if she entered a relationship.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Chabashira-sensei hasn’t had even one boyfriend since
        her student days.
    </p>
    <p>I feel like it would be a serious love if she ever fell for someone of the opposite
        gender.
    </p>
    <p>“You can’t know for sure that Akiyama-san isn’t like that either, though.”</p>
    <p>
        Even if you can’t tell from outward appearances, when you start dating———</p>
    <p>
        “She definitely isn’t.”</p>
    <p>
        He quickly said no with all of his strength, even though he has no basis for it.
    </p>
    <p>“I knew those two since my student days, and never looked at them as the
        opposite gender even once. Not once. Above all, if I support those two who
        are my friends, and also rivals, it would cause a big change in my school life.”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei assertively said that he would never want that to happen.
    </p>
    <p>“Well, that’s true.”</p>
    <p>
        “So, I need your help.”</p>
    <p>
        “Why me?”</p>
    <p>
        “Do you think I can ask the other teachers?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, but…”</p>
    <p>
        “You’re the only person who goes to the gym and can keep a secret.”</p>
    <p>
        “Wait, sensei, the reason you were happy to see me at first today…”</p>
    <p>
        “It was because I made a new gym friend, of course.”</p>
    <p>
        No, that’s definitely a lie.
    </p>
    <p>Those eyes were definitely the eyes of someone who found a student he can
        utilize for this matter.
    </p>
    <p>I can say that for certain now.
    </p>
    <p>“You know what I want to learn, don’t you?”</p>
    <p>
        “I can guess. Whether she has a boyfriend or not. Her type, and her hobbies
        and stuff she likes.”</p>
    <p>
        “Full score. Chabashira must be really happy to have a student like you.”</p>
    <p>
        Is this guy really the Mashima-sensei I’ve known all this time?
    </p>
    <p>I know professional and private lives should be considered on a different
        basis, but this side of him really is surprising.
    </p>
    <p>His voice is really calm, but I can’t see his expression.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m not telling you to start right away. Akiyama-san saw you with me today.
        You can start when winter vacation ends or something, so please slowly get
        close to her and look into her.”</p>
    <p>
        Carefully and cautiously. Just as Mashima-sensei wants.
    </p>
    <p>“I’ll do my best, but please don’t expect too much.”</p>
    <p>
        “I know.”</p>
    <p>
        “About Akiyama-san’s working days…”</p>
    <p>
        “6 days a week except Thursdays.”</p>
    <p>
        “...Right. So you knew.”</p>
    <p>
        The way Mashima-sensei asserted that he goes to the gym every day except
        Thursday did feel a little strange.
    </p>
    <p>I’m sure he did join here to improve his own body, but his objective turned into
        Akiyama-san instead…</p>
    <p>
        It’s not like he’s being negligent in his training though, so there’s no point
        faulting him for it.
    </p>
    <p>I was finally released from Mashima-sensei’s binding, so I left like I was
        running away from something.
