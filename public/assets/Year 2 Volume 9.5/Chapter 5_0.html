    <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
    <h2>The Time We Have Left</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
        I had an argument with Kei over something related to Ichinose.

    </p>
    <p>It’s been a long time since I started intentionally minimizing contact and keeping my distance.

    </p>
    <p>Kei unexpectedly caught influenza and we were not able to meet at Christmas, and before I knew it, the end of the
        year arrived.

    </p>
    <p>December the 29th.

    </p>
    <p>The meeting time we had agreed upon was a little late, at 3 o’clock.

    </p>
    <p>Having nothing else to do until then, I spent an ordinary day off in my room.

    </p>
    <p>I watched some TV, read books, surfed the Internet, and listened to music.

    </p>
    <p>I thought it would be boring, but I found fulfillment in these mundane hours.

    </p>
    <p>When the appointed time was 20 minutes away, I decided to leave my dorm.

    </p>
    <p>We were to meet at the entrance of Keyaki Mall, but I was afraid we would bump into each other.

    </p>
    <p>Despite that, I did not see her in the lobby of the dorms or outside.

    </p>
    <p>I started thinking again.

    </p>
    <p>What does being in a relationship mean to me?

    </p>
    <p>What is love, in the first place?

    </p>
    <p>You will find several definitions if you look up the words ‘going out’ in the dictionary, but the one that
        applies to us right now is ‘dating as lovers’.

    </p>
    <p>That’s easy to understand.

    </p>
    <p>I can take it in a literal way.

    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, if you look up the word ‘love’, you will find that it says ‘a man and a woman yearning for
        each other.’

        Yearning.

    </p>
    <p>Emotions.

    </p>
    <p>I wonder if I have come to know love over these months?

    </p>
    <p>That’s the first point I think about. I have learned many emotions at this school.

    </p>
    <p>Classes, talking with friends, talking with teachers, shopping, having fun.

    </p>
    <p>Along the way, I learned what I’m interested in, and what I’m not interested in.

    </p>
    <p>What I find fun, and what I don’t find fun.

    </p>
    <p>What tastes I like, and what tastes I don’t like, and so much more.

    </p>
    <p>I’ve learned many things that only lovers can experience by dating Kei.

    </p>
    <p>Conversations that only lovers can have, dates, and the act of skin-on-skin contact that can only happen between
        lovers.

    </p>
    <p>I can say that I have probably taken all the actions that would be model answers.

    </p>
    <p>So… Can I say that I know what it feels like to yearn for someone?

    </p>
    <p>The answer is probably no.

    </p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean I know these feelings.

    </p>
    <p>My heart has not shaken in any way since before I started dating Kei.

    </p>
    <p>I’ve asked myself this question over and over again in my daily activities.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t have a clear answer, but I do have an idea.

    </p>
    <p>I’ve been looking at Kei as an object to learn about love.

    </p>
    <p>In other words, I was putting priority on experiencing things that only lovers can experience.

    </p>
    <p>I moved on to the next step before feeling the mentality of wanting to do these things with Kei, and ended up
        leaving those feelings behind.

    </p>
    <p>I have no regrets, of course. I’ve learned many things from Kei.

    </p>
    <p>However, the time is approaching when I need to decide how long to continue this relationship.

    </p>
    <p>The person named Kei holds the most darkness in Horikita’s class.

    </p>
    <p>And she’s strong, but she is also dependent on others.

    </p>
    <p>I’ve taken advantage of that and taken her into my hands.

    </p>
    <p>As long as this dependance is here, however, I cannot achieve my goals.

    </p>
    <p>Now that my policies have changed so drastically, it’s essential for me to break free from this dependance.

    </p>
    <p>That’s precisely why I’m going to earn the right to learn anew.

    </p>
    <p>Will I be hesitant in parting with Kei, or not?

    </p>
    <p>If I feel regret about letting her go, then maybe I can call it love.

    </p>
    <p>There was around five minutes left until the time of our appointment, but Kei was already waiting for me at the
        spot.

    </p>
    <p>Her face was looking down, and she didn’t notice my presence.

    </p>
    <p>Considering the time, she should be paying attention to her surroundings right now.

    </p>
    <p>Is she afraid of not seeing me when she looks up?

    </p>
    <p>Or, is she afraid to face me?

    </p>
    <p>“You’re early.”

    </p>
    <p>I called out to her with some distance between us so as not to surprise her.

    </p>
    <p>“Ah!”

    </p>
    <p>Then, she raised her head.

    </p>
    <p>From her expression, it didn’t seem like she wanted to go on our Christmas date.

    </p>
    <p>She must be feeling very anxious.

    </p>
    <p>At least, I don’t sense any feelings like dislike, disappointment, or loss of interest in me.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s… been… a while…”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. I think it’s been three weeks since we were alone just the two of us like this.”

    </p>
    <p>After exchanging some light words, we approached closer to each other.

    </p>
    <p>After these three awkward weeks, it feels like there’s now something between us stopping us from getting closer
        to each other.

    </p>
    <p>“I heard you’re all better now, right?” “Mhm. Who did you hear it from?”

    </p>
    <p>“Satou was worried and called me last night. That’s when I heard.”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh…”

    </p>
    <p>She’s still a little reserved without any of her usual demeanours.

    </p>
    <p>Even after being in an intimate relationship and spending a lot of time one on one, people still act very
        differently when they get anxious.

    </p>
    <p>“Let’s go inside first, shall we?”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm…”

    </p>
    <p>It’s cold outside in the winter season.

    </p>
    <p>I decided to first take Kei and enter Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>“What are we going to do?”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not sure. Normally, we were supposed to see the Christmas tree, but…”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm…”

    </p>
    <p>The Christmas tree was already taken down, leaving behind nothing but a large empty space.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s sad that you couldn’t see it.”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm…”

    </p>
    <p>Kei has just been repeating ‘mhm’ since we met up.

    </p>
    <p>I guess it’s normal.

    </p>
    <p>I’m the one who neglected to stay in contact with her in the first place.

    </p>
    <p>It’s not a strange thing for her to get mad at me for going out with someone of the opposite gender while I have
        a girlfriend.

    </p>
    <p>She can’t help but see it as cheating from her own objective point of view.

    </p>
    <p>She would never have the courage to open a door of danger.

    </p>
    <p>“For now, I want you to let me apologize for our disagreement because of Ichinose.”

    </p>
    <p>I let Kei stand in front of me, and bowed my head.

    </p>
    <p>“...Kiyotaka…”

    </p>
    <p>“You’re right to feel angry and uneasy. Honestly, none of this is your fault.”

    </p>
    <p>“T-That’s not… I said a lot of bad things too..”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s not true. I think you’ve actually been very patient.”

    </p>
    <p>She didn’t insult me, she simply complained about things that she had a right to complain about.

    </p>
    <p>“I wanted to apologize earlier, but I ended up being late in the end.”

    </p>
    <p>At the same time, I took a box out of my pocket.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s this?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s late, but this is your Christmas present. I want you to take it.”

    </p>
    <p>She slowly reached out with her hand, then withdrew for a moment.

    </p>
    <p>She’s still feeling uneasy; it’s a reaction of fear.

    </p>
    <p>I touched her stiffened hand, and gently made her hold the box.

    </p>
    <p>Then, I took her coat and encouraged her to open the box.

    </p>
    <p>“Can I open it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course.”

    </p>
    <p>She readied herself and opened the lid while holding the box with her left hand.

    </p>
    <p>What came out of the box was a glittering necklace.

    </p>
    <p>She stared at it and looked up with surprise.

    </p>
    <p>“Did… Did I tell you that I wanted this?”

    </p>
    <p>“You didn’t have to. I saw you looking at it many times on your phone. You looked at a lot of other stuff too,
        but I felt like this one was special to you.”

    </p>
    <p>There were more expensive things among the precious metal items she looked at, but I don’t think Kei, who
        understands my position as a student, would wish for anything unrealistic.

    </p>
    <p>First, I thought that this was definitely the right choice, but…

        “...”

    </p>
    <p>Kei’s hand is still frozen up.

    </p>
    <p>“Did I get the wrong one?”

    </p>
    <p>If so, I failed in choosing to buy this on my own.

    </p>
    <p>However, Kei grasped the necklace and quickly shook her neck no.

    </p>
    <p>“Nu-uh, it’s the right one!”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. That’s good to hear.”

    </p>
    <p>“This, this isn’t a dream, right..!?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei didn’t care about the people around us and started crying.

    </p>
    <p>I can say that her dependance on me is at its peak right now.

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure I could even force her to do things that I couldn’t even put into words.

    </p>
    <p>However, I’m not going to end the relationship here, because it’s not going to lead to a fundamental solution
        even if I let her loose here.

    </p>
    <p>“Kiyotaka?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei looked at me with wet eyes while I was busy thinking.

    </p>
    <p>“You’re gonna stay over tonight, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Kei had a full-faced smile, and grabbed my arm.

    </p>
    <p>“I… I thought that it was over already..!”

    </p>
    <p>“Are you gonna accept it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Obviously..!”

    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 9.5/Images/image9.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        Teardrops fell onto her mouth as she held the necklace.

    </p>
    <p>“We can go back to normal now… Right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, back to normal.”

    </p>
    <p>“You really, really mean it, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“You can trust me.”

    </p>
    <p>Kei repeatedly asked so, and I gave her the same answer.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m so, so happy!”

    </p>
    <p>“I wanted to celebrate Christmas with you, but we’re definitely going to spend your birthday together.”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm, mhm!”

    </p>
    <p>Kei’s birthday is March the 8th.

    </p>
    <p>It’s going to be before the final test is conducted.

    </p>
    <p>Nothing will change up until then.

    </p>
    <p>I will support her if she has any problems, and protect her, just like normal.

    </p>
    <p>That’s my role as the host of a parasite.

    </p>
    <p>She put the necklace on, and grabbed my arm with a somewhat embarrassed expression.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s been such a long time… Hasn’t it?”

    </p>
    <p>“Yeah. Where should we go?”

    </p>
    <p>“As long as it’s with you, I’m fine with anything.”

    </p>
    <p>She doesn’t want anything more than that. With that reply, she clung closer to me.

    </p>
    <p>“Can I come to your room again today?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’d be harder to find a reason to say no.”

    </p>
    <p>“How about the bath? Can we enter together?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course.”

    </p>
    <p>“Ehehehehe.”

    </p>
    <p>She happily loosened her cheeks, and perhaps because of the tears, wiped the corners of her mouth with her
        fingers again.

    </p>
    <p>The relationship is restored.

    </p>
    <p>This is a joyous action, but why isn’t my heart moving?

    </p>
    <p>Why can’t I be more delighted, tremble more, and be happier with her?

    </p>
    <p>I don’t know.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m glad we made up.”

    </p>
    <p>Made up words.

    </p>
    <p>Kei is pleased and happy to hear them.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t feel sad about not understanding, though.

    </p>
    <p>If I don’t understand, then I can just repeat this until I do.

    </p>
    <p>If it doesn’t work with Kei, then I can just try it with another person.

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure the time for me to learn about love will come someday.

    </p>
    <p>I might see myself abandoned, bitter and crying.

    </p>
    <p>I can’t wait.

    </p>
    <p>A bottomless quest is pushing me on.

    </p>
    <p>That is, because of the fact that I don’t know.

    </p>
    <p>I still have infinite room for learning.

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe we should go to karaoke? It’s been a long time.”

    </p>
    <p>For now, I should just think about mending things between me and Kei.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t want to keep quiet and make her worry again, so I spoke out.

    </p>
    <p>“Wow, I’m surprised to see you asking us to go to karaoke, Kiyotaka!”

    </p>
    <p>I have gone to karaoke quite a few times, but I never really wanted to sing myself, so Kei may be right that it’s
        a rare thing for me.

    </p>
    <p>“I’ve been listening to a lot of hit songs on TV lately.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s a good partner to make sure that I won’t get embarrassed if I go to karaoke with other students in the
        future.

    </p>
    <p>Kei raised her hand and smiled to show that she agreed, and we started walking.

    </p>
    <p>On the way, my eye was drawn to the vending machines in the resting area.

    </p>
    <p>Could Yamamura be sitting between these machines again today?

    </p>
    <p>“...What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>She was curious why I stopped walking and looked at the vending machines.

    </p>
    <p>“Are you thirsty?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s not it.”

    </p>
    <p>I wonder what kind of words Yamamura received after she informed Sakayanagi.

    </p>
    <p>Was she taken down from her role, or was she asked to observe someone unrelated to Ryuen?

    </p>
    <p>“Ah, right. Can I call Maya-chan real quick?”

    </p>
    <p>I agreed and sat down on a nearby bench to avoid her messages.

    </p>
    <p>“Can I sit next to you?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, I’m gonna take a look at the vending machines and come back. There might be some new items I’d like.”

    </p>
    <p>“Okay.”

    </p>
    <p>Kei started happily chatting with Satou.

    </p>
    <p>I can guess that she’s informing her that we made up, and receiving congratulations and such.

    </p>
    <p>In the meanwhile, I decided to head towards the vending machines.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t think she’d be there, but this is just for caution’s sake.

    </p>
    <p>I slightly peeked between the vending machines, and…

        “!?”

    </p>
    <p>No way…

        She’s here.

    </p>
    <p>Sitting down in the same way as the other day, she even has a bottle in one hand just like that day again.

    </p>
    <p>The only difference is that there’s a shopping bag with some stuff in it on the floor this time.

    </p>
    <p>“We meet again. Are you here all the time?”

    </p>
    <p>“Not all the time… Just sometimes.”

    </p>
    <p>She averted her gaze as she said so, perhaps because she just told an awkward lie.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s that?”

    </p>
    <p>“Huh? Ah, this? It’s a hand-towel I bought as a reward for myself.”

    </p>
    <p>“A reward?”

    </p>
    <p>“...Please don’t worry about it. More importantly, it looks like you made up with Karuizawa-san, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Did you hear?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, that’s my specialty, so.”

    </p>
    <p>She said in a muddy way, but she means that she’s good at eavesdropping.

    </p>
    <p>“Maybe you should leave now. She might realize how weird it is for you to come here to think about new products.”

    </p>
    <p>It seems that she impressively picked up our entire conversation.

    </p>
    <p>I would like to know how Sakayanagi reacted, but this is a matter of internal class affairs, so I doubt she would
        give me a simple answer.

    </p>
    <p>So, I’d rather not embarrass her by asking.

    </p>
    <p>“See you.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Yes.”

    </p>
    <p>I left the environment that made it look like I was chatting with a vending machine.

    </p>
    <p>I returned to the bench, and Kei seemed to have just finished chatting with Satou, so it was the right choice to
        come back quickly.

    </p>
    <p>“Did you find anything?”

    </p>
    <p>“Nothing much. Shall we go?”

    </p>
    <p>“Mhm.”

    </p>
    <p>Kei cheerfully stood up and grabbed my arm again.

    </p>
    <p>I almost can’t believe how quickly she went back to normal.

    </p>
    <p>No, it’s so much that I can feel that her dependance on me has increased even compared to before.

    </p>
    <p>She wanted to eat together, bathe together, and even sleep together.

    </p>
    <p>She wants to spend all her time with me without letting me go even for a moment.

    </p>
    <p>The parasite is going deeper and deeper to the point where it cannot escape on its own.

    </p>
    <p>It’s stepping in without fear of being captured.

    </p>
    <p>Thus, we built a better relationship than before during the year and welcomed the New Year as lovers.

    </p>
    <p>As a side note, I still remember the sigh of her humming in a good mood as she left her room for the New Year’s
        gathering with her friends that she had originally planned to attend.
