    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        The store is very crowded with a lot of students and other school staff.

    </p>
    <p>I continued observing it from a small distance away.

    </p>
    <p>The customers who were lined up were guided into the store 30 minutes before the opening and hurriedly started
        buying the bargain goods.

    </p>
    <p>Would the customers really be able to buy the best of the best now that the store is in general admission?

    </p>
    <p>Still, I wasn’t worried.

    </p>
    <p>Why would any student want a yogurt maker?

    </p>
    <p>That’s what I think.

    </p>
    <p>No, I’m sure there aren’t any.

    </p>
    <p>So there’s nothing to be anxious about…

        With that in mind, I entered the store late, and my hopes were dashed.

    </p>
    <p>The yogurt makers from the advertisement were already sold out.

    </p>
    <p>I was stabbed by the reality that other people bought them all.

    </p>
    <p>Seeing that and becoming desperate, I reached out to the last yogurt maker, but I heard that its price is many
        times higher than the ones on sale, so I gave up on buying it and left the store.

    </p>
    <p>Even now, students from the mass-merchandise store are coming out with pleased expressions.

    </p>
    <p>“So frustrating…”

    </p>
    <p>I truthfully expressed my feelings.

    </p>
    <p>It was my own grievous fault for not looking into the sale pattern.

    </p>
    <p>This is the end of the loser who neglected to gather information, huh?

    </p>
    <p>I stopped by the supermarket on my way out of the mall.

    </p>
    <p>I headed straight for the dairy products section without a basket, as if I was being guided there somehow.

    </p>
    <p>There were many manufacturers selling milk, and yogurt.

    </p>
    <p>I was so close to having the magical power to turn this milk into yogurt.

    </p>
    <p>I wanted to try it out. I’m starting to well up with emotion.

    </p>
    <p>My distance to the usual milk bags and the yogurt is far. No, this isn’t just a matter of distance.

    </p>
    <p>It was as if they were blocked behind some invisible glass.

    </p>
    <p>I bet this is how the young boy who wanted to buy the trumpet behind the showcase must have felt like.

    </p>
    <p>…

        This is totally different though, isn’t it?

    </p>
    <p>Even at this moment, boys and girls are busy picking up milk and yogurt one after the other and buying them.

    </p>
    <p>I just ran out of yogurt myself.

    </p>
    <p>However, wouldn’t it be an admission of defeat if I buy yogurt here?

    </p>
    <p>I told myself I was going to leave, but my legs won’t move.

    </p>
    <p>As for why…

        The milk is being sold at a special price, different from the usual one.

    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the yogurt is also 20 yen cheaper than usual.

    </p>
    <p>If it wasn’t for the yogurt maker, I’m sure I’d have bought some before leaving.

    </p>
    <p>“...”

    </p>
    <p>I became unable to move away from the dairy produce section, almost as if bound in chains.

    </p>
    <p>“Eggs are pretty cheap too…”

    </p>
    <p>Inflation coupled with the global state of affairs has kept prices rising and rising.

    </p>
    <p>This school has its own rules and is somewhat isolated from society, but it’s essentially the same as the outside
        world in this matter.

    </p>
    <p>After graduation, the days of facing the prices before us and consulting our wallets will begin.

    </p>
    <p>I’m not planning to begin doing that, but…

        Well, I’m just an ordinary person now, so it should be okay to think like that.

    </p>
    <p>It was a total mistake to come here just because I wanted to check out what was happening.

    </p>
    <p>Anyway, I can’t stay here forever.

    </p>
    <p>I forced my heavy feet to drag me away, and made up my mind to leave on the way.

    </p>
    <p>“What’s wrong? I’ve never seen you look so dejected before, Ayanokoji.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Kiryuuin-senpai.”

    </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin called out to me as I was making up my will to retreat.

    </p>
    <p>My legs strangely became lighter and I started moving away.

    </p>
    <p>I had originally only stopped by here to look at the yogurts on display, and not for any specific purpose.

    </p>
    <p>I left the store empty-handed and Kiryuuin followed behind me.

    </p>
    <p>On the way, I briefly explained what happened.

    </p>
    <p>I probably wanted someone to hear it.

    </p>
    <p>I think I wanted someone to understand my disappointment at not being able to buy a yogurt maker.

    </p>
    <p>I told her that I found out about the discount last night, and that I rushed to the store before it opened, but
        misunderstood where to line up.

    </p>
    <p>As a result, someone else bought it and I couldn’t acquire it myself.

    </p>
    <p>After hearing it all, Kiryuuin found my story funny and laughed.

    </p>
    <p>“You never stop being interesting, Ayanokoji. You really are a special man.”

    </p>
    <p>“Is that so? I intend on being an ordinary high schooler you could see anywhere, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“What a unique joke. No, there’s a part of you that’s like that too, but…”

    </p>
    <p>She denied at first, but added an affirmation.

    </p>
    <p>“I laughed precisely because you were acting like just a normal high school student. I think it’s weird to be
        obsessed with a yogurt maker, but it wouldn’t be weird to replace that with another item.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see…”

    </p>
    <p>“You really wanted that yogurt maker though, huh? I think it’d be a lot cheaper, tastier and safer if you just
        bought yogurt, though.”

    </p>
    <p>Saying that, she looked back at the supermarket as we continued walking away.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s a meaning to making things yourself and eating them. I lost that chance.”

    </p>
    <p>“You’re expressionless, but I can see that you’re enthusiastic about this.”

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t you cook, Senpai?”

    </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin nodded without hesitation when I asked back.

    </p>
    <p>“I tried when I was little to make my parents happy, but I’ve never done it since then.”

    </p>
    <p>“Was the result that bad?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, I can’t really say much about it. It wasn’t particularly delicious, nor tasteless. My parents were just
        happy about me cooking for them. Normally, I guess you’d try to improve your cooking to see their happy faces
        again.”

    </p>
    <p>She seems to have abandoned the culinary path once and for all instead of taking that path.

    </p>
    <p>“I usually eat out at convenience stores or the school cafeteria. When I do stop by a supermarket, I usually buy
        ready-made food from the side-dish section.”

    </p>
    <p>I thought she might be cooking too, but the opposite seems to be true.

    </p>
    <p>It feels strange that she’s here, now that she told me she doesn’t cook.

    </p>
    <p>“How about you? When did you end up liking cooking?”

    </p>
    <p>“Since my high school debut. It was my first time living alone, and since I started in D Class, my class points
        ran out very often.”

    </p>
    <p>“So you decided to cook for yourself to save money on food?”

    </p>
    <p>“Even if there’s a way to eat for free, it would be painful to eat the same thing all year. You can improve and
        become more efficient by repeatedly cooking, and your efficiency will get better with time too. I’ve recently
        begun to think that it would be good to maximize cost-effectiveness.”

    </p>
    <p>The new yogurt maker could have been a new step up.

    </p>
    <p>I’m starting to regret not getting one again.

    </p>
    <p>“So? If you really wanted one that badly, why didn’t you just buy one?”

    </p>
    <p>“The price difference compared to the bargain version is too high. I guess it has a lot of features, but I just
        wanted to ferment milk, so I decided that it was unnecessary.”

    </p>
    <p>I’d be doing exactly what the store wants if I got desperate and started buying expensive products.

    </p>
    <p>“Did you try searching on the internet?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, not yet.”

    </p>
    <p>“You shouldn’t feel down before you take a look on the internet, then. There’s a few sites I can recommend to
        you.”

    </p>
    <p>She took out her phone and typed in the search words.

    </p>
    <p>We stood on the edge of the passage to not bother incoming customers and looked at her phone, and found one with
        a price that isn’t much different from today’s special price.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s surprising.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s the thing about special sales, it’s not just the electronics retailers at this school that are having
        trouble handling and selling the same item from their inventory. This is just common sense that all young people
        these days should know.”

    </p>
    <p>“This is very helpful.”

    </p>
    <p>“Why don’t you buy it online?”

    </p>
    <p>“I get that I can indeed buy it for the same price, but I just discovered something new as well. I’m going to
        look for something simpler to buy when I go back to my room.”

    </p>
    <p>After looking into it, the yogurt seller that was on sale had a lot more features than necessary.

    </p>
    <p>I now know that I can find something cheaper and simpler.

    </p>
    <p>“Most of all, it feels like a loss to buy the same thing. By the way, are you done with your shopping?”

    </p>
    <p>“I just saw you from behind and came after you since I thought this would be interesting. I don’t really need
        anything from the supermarket.”

    </p>
    <p>It looks like she has no business in the supermarket itself.

    </p>
    <p>“Pretty strange of you to call out to me just to see how I’m acting curiously.”

    </p>
    <p>Does she have too much time because there’s nothing to do for her on winter vacation?

    </p>
    <p>“I know what you’re thinking, but let me tell you that it’s not like I’m getting involved in random things just
        because I have nothing else to do.”

    </p>
    <p>“I hope that’s the case, but it seems doubtful.”

    </p>
    <p>She laughed bitterly and started explaining again after I honestly told her what I thought.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s because it was you, and not anyone else.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not the kind of person that deserves so much appreciation.”

    </p>
    <p>“You know there’s no point in being modest now, don’t you? The way you confronted those guys on the Uninhabited
        Island is burned into my brain, whether I like it or not.”

    </p>
    <p>The scene at the beach when I finally settled the score with Tsukishiro.

    </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin also exchanged fists with Tsukishiro's supposed subordinate Shiba in the form of helping.

    </p>
    <p>Leaving aside the physical aspect, I suppose it is not unreasonable for her to regard me in a special way after I
        was in that unusual situation which would not normally occur.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s why it’s unfortunate.”

    </p>
    <p>“Unfortunate?”

    </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin deeply exhaled like a girl about to confess something she had been keeping inside her heart for a long
        time.

    </p>
    <p>“In the summer, I often wished that this school had a system of repeating years.”

    </p>
    <p>“Repeating years?”

    </p>
    <p>I suppose each student who can’t graduate in A Class might think that way at least once out of regret.

    </p>
    <p>They give up on it right away, however.

    </p>
    <p>In the first place, this school fundamentally does not allow one to repeat a year.

    </p>
    <p>“What a stupid idea, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“Definitely. Most students don’t try to go against the set rules.”

    </p>
    <p>The act of breaking the rules can be done by anyone.

    </p>
    <p>Oppose, overturn.

    </p>
    <p>Convince them.

    </p>
    <p>Make them change things.

    </p>
    <p>That’s the hard part.

    </p>
    <p>“But I still wanted to consider the option of remaining next year. Because if that came true, I could watch you
        closely through the year.”

    </p>
    <p>“I didn’t think there were any students who think that way. You are pretty strange, after all.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s Kiryuuin, so this is probably more than just a fantasy in her head.

    </p>
    <p>“There’s nothing that can’t be bought with private points. I even tried to use that basis to convince the
        teachers, but the answer I got was a no.”

    </p>
    <p>“Let me ask you, would you be willing to offer the maximum amount of 20 million points for it?”

    </p>
    <p>The only way to overturn the rule of no repeated years is to pay a huge price.

    </p>
    <p>I did good to ask her, but I can already see the answer from Kiryuuin’s expression.

    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 9.5/Images/image2.webp" alt="">

    <p>
        “The biggest thing you can purchase in this school is the right to move to any class. Unless you have some
        really strange tastes, moving to Class A near graduation will finally give you your dream after three years.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s right. I don’t think there’s anything better than that to buy.”

    </p>
    <p>There is a definitive power balance between the right to A Class and repeating a year.

    </p>
    <p>Who would want to willingly invest 20 million points in a high-risk year?

    </p>
    <p>“So why is it that even if you have a large amount of money to spend, you’re still not allowed to repeat a year?
        Don’t you think it’s strange? There are systems such as stopping or nullifying expulsions or moving classes in
        the school rule book, but there was never anything about repeating a year.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s right.

    </p>
    <p>It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that there’s nothing you can’t buy with private points, but the reality is
        that there is something you cannot buy.

    </p>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, intentionally repeating a year can’t be worth more than moving to A Class in the same year.

    </p>
    <p>Still, there is definitely a reason that it is not allowed.

    </p>
    <p>“The student who wants to repeat a year will have a greater knowledge of special tests and such if they remain in
        the school for an extra year. It would be possible to consider it unfair against other classes on an information
        level.”

    </p>
    <p>Information? It’s true that you can think of it that way, but you don’t have to stay in school to share
        information.

    </p>
    <p>Kind-hearted seniors can easily leave information for the junior students in their daily life.

    </p>
    <p>Besides, the information advantage would not be that big of a deal.

    </p>
    <p>Each special test is fundamentally different from those in the year above.

    </p>
    <p>Even if one gains an advantage in written tests, it’s unlikely to have a significant impact on the crowd.

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t you think it could lead to a decrease in the school’s value?”

    </p>
    <p>“Oh? What do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>“This school gives a big advantage to those who graduated in A Class. Companies also consider students who
        graduated in A Class to be superior and hire them, but when you mix in students who have repeated a year, won’t
        that call the value of the school into question? Those who can only look at the results from the outside will be
        curious if a student has repeated a year despite graduating in A Class. We can also apply this to you,
        Kiryuuin-senpai. A strange person who inefficiently did not graduate in A Class and repeated a year instead. You
        would still be considered as someone of skill, but it will be blurry for those who might hire you. It would be
        very difficult to evaluate such a person.”

    </p>
    <p>The school will also no longer be willing to send her out there.

    </p>
    <p>“So you’re saying that repeating a year is forbidden in order to eliminate this pattern?”

    </p>
    <p>“That would be it if I had to make a guess.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s very likely. I think I might not hire me if I had to interview myself.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s a self-deprecating joke she can say precisely because she has confidence in her own abilities.

    </p>
    <p>“Please transfer to Nagumo’s class instead if you’re going to repeat a year on a whim.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not interested in that.”

    </p>
    <p>“Even if you had 20 million points saved up solely for yourself?”

    </p>
    <p>“Even if. I don’t care which class I graduate in.”

    </p>
    <p>“I realize that there’s not much difference for you between graduating in A Class and graduating in D Class, but
        it would be common sense to graduate in A Class if you can anyway.”

    </p>
    <p>“After graduation, they convert your private points into real cash. That’s a lot more important for me.”

    </p>
    <p>No matter how much it is, that’s going to be a big amount of money for someone who has just graduated from high
        school.

    </p>
    <p>However, it’s usually not weighed against the possibility of graduating in A Class, which could be very useful in
        the future.

    </p>
    <p>“Private points fulfill most of a student’s wishes, but not all of them. That’s also a part of it.”

    </p>
    <p>“I suppose so. It’s also impossible to fire the teachers you don’t get along with, so.”

    </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin grinned and said something disturbing.

    </p>
    <p>“It almost sounds like you tried to do it.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hehe, I’m not going to comment on that.”

    </p>
    <p>“You really don’t have any interest in A Class, huh?”

    </p>
    <p>“You shouldn’t be so surprised. I may be in a rare category indeed, but I don’t think I’m the first one. Besides,
        I thought you were the same way too, but..?”

    </p>
    <p>It’s true that I’m not clinging onto A Class, because I’m not going to get the follow-up from school, which is
        the biggest advantage it provides.

    </p>
    <p>“You and I may not be so different indeed, Kiryuuin-senpai. Still, even if there were other students who were
        disinterested in A Class like me, there’s still a big difference between you and them.”

    </p>
    <p>“What would that be?”

    </p>
    <p>“Contributions to the class. Normally, one works for their fellow students even if it is not necessary for
        themselves. Someone highly capable like you could have lent a helping hand to B Class and crossed paths with
        former Student Council President Nagumo. Even if they have different personalities and ideas from you, I’m sure
        your classmates have asked you for help once or twice.”

    </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin affirmed it as if she were talking about someone else.

    </p>
    <p>“Yet, for three years up until now, you’ve only been acting for your own sake.”

    </p>
    <p>“Couldn’t I have been contributing in my own way from behind the scenes? It may not have been a match for Nagumo,
        though.”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s easy to tell when I look at Kiriyama-senpai from the same class, no, even all of the Year Three students.
        You only work for your own sake, but you don’t drag the others down either. So you’re neither enemy nor an
        ally.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s like a fly on the wall both for friends and enemies. Leaving ability aside, it’s no simple thing to do
        that.

    </p>
    <p>“There were some who spoke out their grudges and hard feelings, but they stopped talking to me before I noticed.”

    </p>
    <p>The fact that she was inevitably forgiven is evident in the results.

    </p>
    <p>The fact that she is held to a high standard of academic and physical level by the school means that she has
        achieved a certain level of success in written tests, athletic classes and tournaments.

    </p>
    <p>From what someone in our class (including me) can see, she doesn’t seem to be cutting corners.

    </p>
    <p>“Can I ask you a few questions too?”

    </p>
    <p>“Is there something you wanted to ask me?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s a foolish question. There are countless things I’d like to ask you, but you’re going to get annoyed if I
        ask you a dozen or more questions and there’s no proof that you’re going to tell me the truth.”

    </p>
    <p>She put her question to words after such a preface.

    </p>
    <p>“Can I assume that the various problems I’m sure you had are solved?”

    </p>
    <p>That’s a broad definition, but I don’t have to think deeply about what she means.

    </p>
    <p>“Thanks to you. My daily life is pretty peaceful right now.”

    </p>
    <p>I emphasized that things are peaceful right now as we walk as well.

    </p>
    <p>“No matter how many times I think back, I can’t forget your smooth movements on the beach that day. They were far
        beyond anything I could imagine, or thought possible to do as a human being. I bet even my uncle wouldn’t
        believe me if I told him.”

    </p>
    <p>“Uncle?”

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry, was that a difficult to understand way of saying it? I mean my grandfather.”

    </p>
    <p>She squinted her eyes with yearning after that, remembering her grandfather.

    </p>
    <p>I know what the words mean, but I don’t think it’s common for people to call their grandfathers uncle.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s a pretty weird way of referring to him.”

    </p>
    <p>“I may not look like it, but I’m still a nice lady. That’s what I call him at home.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. Well, I guess that makes sense, but…”

    </p>
    <p>I always felt that she was raised well somehow.

    </p>
    <p>She also always felt rough in contrast, so there was never any proof of anything like that.

    </p>
    <p>“I spent a lot more time with my uncle when I was little since my parents were busy with work. To use a familiar
        expression, I was quite the uncle's girl.”

    </p>
    <p>She smiled and squinted with nostalgia.

    </p>
    <p>It’s an expression you can’t have if you have a lot of bad memories.

    </p>
    <p>“I was really depressed when I found out that I was entering this school and could not see him for three years.”

    </p>
    <p>“He really cares a lot about you too, doesn’t he?”

    </p>
    <p>“He was always saying that I’m welcome to leave the school any time.”

    </p>
    <p>That’s a pretty terrible thing to say to one’s grandchild spreading her wings.

    </p>
    <p>From that remark alone, he does not seem to be a normal grandfather.

    </p>
    <p>“But wouldn’t he be shocked if you actually dropped out?”

    </p>


    <p>“No, I have no doubt that he would truly be happy. If I hadn’t decided to make my own way in the first place, I’d
        be able to go to most universities and companies with a <label style="cursor: pointer; color: blue;"
            for="toggle">single word from the crane.”</label> </p>
    <input type="checkbox" id="toggle" style="display: none;">
    <p class="note" id="example-note">
        Expression, authoritative voice, final word.
    </p>

    <p>In other words, even if she doesn’t graduate in A Class, she’s still going to get a lot of support from her
        grandfather.

    </p>
    <p>He has both power and favour, it seems.

    </p>
    <p>There was someone in my class who was in a similar position too, but with a different way of thinking.

    </p>
    <p>“Do you know about Koenji, by any chance?”

    </p>
    <p>“Koenji? Why did you suddenly mention his name?”

    </p>
    <p>“Why? I mean, look.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s because I saw Koenji walking towards us.

    </p>
    <p>Coupled with the contents of our chat, that’s why I asked about her relationship with him.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think you’d have anything to do with a strange person like that, though.”

    </p>
    <p>He’s attracting the attention of the students around him, who are looking at him like they’re looking at
        something bizarre.

    </p>
    <p>He is carrying a large box all by himself, which has the logo of a famous manufacturer.

    </p>
    <p>I guessed what was inside from the shape of the box. It’s probably a large flat-screen TV.

    </p>
    <p>“Don’t you know? Koenji is the son of a pretty famous businessman. I heard that he was even already named as the
        next president of the company.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. Maybe that’s why he’s so eccentric. Unfortunately though, I don’t know much about his circumstances
        either. If his father really is famous though, then there may be some connection between him and my grandfather…
        Well, it’s none of my business either way.”

    </p>
    <p>It seems that Kiryuuin has no knowledge of the political or business world.

    </p>
    <p>In that sense, it’s nice to know that she’s not going to get stuck on the somewhat unusual name of ‘Ayanokoji’.

    </p>
    <p>Even if she did know the surname, it would be absurd to connect it directly to me.

    </p>
    <p>It wouldn’t be that simple to think of me as someone from the same family, even if it is an unusual name.

    </p>
    <p>“Could that be the root of your disinterest in A Class?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course not. I came into this school because I was fed up with being born into such a wealthy family. I have
        no intentions of living under their roof after graduation. The Year Three students have already ended their
        class warfare, so I’m concentrating on enrolling in a university and job hunting activities like everyone else.”

    </p>
    <p>In other words, Kiryuuin has a clear path ahead of her.

    </p>
    <p>Further, she also has no intention of receiving any favours from her family.

    </p>
    <p>“Just for reference, may I ask what kind of path you want to move into?”

    </p>
    <p>“First, I’m going to university. I can keep my costs in check if I enter as a scholarship student. I’ll earn more
        money for my daily life by working part-time. There’s nothing particularly special to talk about.”

    </p>
    <p>“Leaving aside the scholarship, it sounds like you want to be a normal student.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’m going to freely study on my own and grow up to be an adult, then work for a small company or something. I
        don’t care if it’s something lesser than that either. I will lead a life that is not associated with the
        Kiryuuin name or status.”

    </p>
    <p>She will live a life of freedom, unrestricted and not standing out from society.

    </p>
    <p>That’s the meaning I get from her words.

    </p>
    <p>“That doesn’t sound so bad.”

    </p>
    <p>“Right? I don’t need anything special. That’s what I think right now, at least.”

    </p>
    <p>In a way, it’s pretty similar to the way I thought about things when I entered school.

    </p>
    <p>It doesn’t matter if I go up or down in class, I’m going to continue living my life for my own freedom.

    </p>
    <p>There’s a person right next to me here who has followed this idea for three years.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s no easy thing to obtain a peaceful and smooth life, however. Even if things are good enough now, the
        Kiryuuin name will still be attached to me after I graduate, whether I like it or not.”

    </p>
    <p>I don’t know anything about the Kiryuuin family, but if the family has a certain degree of fame, then it’s
        natural for her to have a kind of track laid out for her.

    </p>
    <p>Even if she escaped into this school out of rebellion like I did, it still ends after three years whether she
        likes it or not.

    </p>
    <p>“Wouldn’t your grandfather leave you alone?”

    </p>
    <p>“No, the problem is my parents. Unlike my grandfather, they don’t have even an ounce of humour in them. It’s not
        hard to imagine what their reactions would be if they knew that I was living an ordinary life.”

    </p>
    <p>That point might be somewhat similar to my family situation.

    </p>
    <p>Chatting with her like this, I feel like her circumstances closely resemble mine.

    </p>
    <p>“I have no regrets about my actions over the past three years. I did as I pleased.”

    </p>
    <p>Her expression showed a slight hesitation even as she declared her conviction.

    </p>
    <p>“Still, I wanted to see myself as a person who did not choose only to purpose freedom. Maybe that’s why I was
        trying to see if I could repeat a year.”

    </p>
    <p>If Kiryuuin-senpai had used all her might in her three years, there’s no mistaking the fact that she would have
        been a threat for the A Class ruled by Nagumo.

    </p>
    <p>Living up to her lineage may also be a difficult task.

    </p>
    <p>“The battle with Nagumo isn’t over yet, is it? What are you going to do about that?”

    </p>
    <p>“I hope I have an opportunity to do something, but I don't know what’s going to happen.”

    </p>
    <p>Everything will be decided by the school.

    </p>
    <p>It’s a matter of chance whether me or Nagumo will have the opportunity to step in ourselves.

    </p>
    <p>Also…

        There are also routes that cannot be realized, regardless of if I desire them or not.

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t think you would be negligent or self-conceited, but you should be cautious during the third term.”

    </p>
    <p>“Is this an advice from a senpai?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s nothing that you would call advice. I just heard Nagumo talking on the phone with someone the other day. He
        seemed to be trying to gather gossip about the Year Two students.”

    </p>
    <p>I wonder if Nagumo has his antenna up more than anyone in order to make the fight with me happen.

    </p>
    <p>“There might be something more troublesome waiting for you at the next special test you’re going to take.”

    </p>
    <p>“The school won’t implicitly leak out information, but the difficulty of special tests can easily be guessed by
        past statistics. Actually, how was the special test that was conducted at the start of Year Two’s third term?”

    </p>
    <p>If there is a high probability that a similar trend would continue, Nagumo would be able to associate it with
        last year’s special test.

    </p>
    <p>“I’m not sure. Nagumo is in charge and has authority over everything in our year. I’m just a B Class student
        living my days, I don’t remember every single thing.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see.”

    </p>
    <p>Indeed, it’s essentially rare for Kiryuuin to participate in special tests.

    </p>
    <p>There’s something that bothers me about the part where she said she doesn’t remember, though.

    </p>
    <p>“However, there was one person who left B Class at the time of that special test.”

    </p>
    <p>“Leave? You mean expelled?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s what I remember. It was probably a necessary sacrifice, thrown away by Nagumo’s adjustments.”

    </p>
    <p>Nagumo’s ideal of victory and defeat, and their recompense.

    </p>
    <p>There will certainly be sacrifices made in a special test where expulsions are inevitable.

    </p>
    <p>If what Kiryuuin says is true, then there might be difficult developments waiting for me as soon as the third
        term starts.

    </p>
    <p>“The expulsions will probably be mostly from D or C classes, though.”

    </p>
    <p>“We’ll see. I don’t remember anything about the circumstances in other classes.”

    </p>
    <p>She’s probably even less interested in other classes than the morning news on TV.

    </p>
    <p>Still, she says she doesn’t remember anything, but she does seem to know some key points.

    </p>
    <p>“It won’t necessarily be the same as last year, though. There’s no need to get so worked up”

    </p>
    <p>“I don’t find it very convincing to hear you say that, as you don’t have a grasp on anything.”

    </p>
    <p>I did not pursue the matter further at this point and let it slide instead.

    </p>
    <p>“Sorry I interrupted you. I couldn’t have had an easy-going chat with you like this at any other time. It was a
        good opportunity.”

    </p>
    <p>“No, I’m glad I was able to chat with you.”

    </p>
    <p>Kiryuuin was just about to turn around and walk away, but she immediately stopped and turned back to me.

    </p>
    <p>“This is just a hunch I have, but I have a feeling that you and I will meet again in the near future, at a place
        other than this school.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Do your hunches usually come true?”
    </p>

    <p>“Half the time, usually.”

    </p>
    <p>I guess you really could just call it a hunch…</p>
    <p>
        “I’m pretty confident this time, though. If I had to tell you why, I’d say it’s because you’re not a normal high
        school student. I’m sure we’ll see each other again if we don’t get buried by society.”

    </p>
    <p>“Wouldn’t that be better? I thought you wanted a normal life.”

    </p>
    <p>“Hm? Hehehehe, you may actually be right.”

    </p>
    <p>She lightly waved her hand and started walking out of Keyaki Mall.

    </p>
    <p>See each other again somewhere else, huh?

    </p>
    <p>That future will probably never come.

    </p>
    <p>
        However, if it did…
    </p>

    <p>
        No, I should let that idea go.
    </p>

    <p>There’s no meaning in such fantasies about the future.

    </p>
    <p>I am living freely at this moment, right now.

    </p>
    <p>That is enough for me.

    </p>
    <p></p>
