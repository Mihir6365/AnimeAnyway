    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <h2>Irreplaceable Daily Life</h2>

    <p>
        Second year.
    </p>
    <p>Start of the second winter break at Advanced Nurturing High School.
    </p>
    <p>Most students will be enjoying their vacation days.
    </p>
    <p>A time of replenishment.
    </p>
    <p>However, although slowly, the time I have left is decreasing, but I’m not
        worried.
    </p>
    <p>Just the fact that I was able to spend my time freely up until now is good
        enough for me.
    </p>
    <p>Friends.
    </p>
    <p>Lovers.
    </p>
    <p>My seniors and juniors.
    </p>
    <p>New meetings.
    </p>
    <p>Among many others, I’m also still living in this school.
    </p>
    <p>The battle from here on will be a long one.
    </p>
    <p>All I have to do is to spend the time I was given as a student to the last
        second.
    </p>
    <p>Then, face what will come one day…
        Separation.
    </p>
    <p>Today isn’t a given.
    </p>
    <p>Tomorrow isn’t a given either.
    </p>
    <p>One has to understand that each day is a part of our irreplaceable daily lives.
    </p>
    <p>You don’t have to do anything special.
    </p>
    <p></p>
