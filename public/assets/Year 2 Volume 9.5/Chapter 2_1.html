    <h3>Part 1</h3><p>
I arrived at Keyaki Mall at 9:55 a.m. on the same day.

</p><p>Seven students were already at the entrance closest to the dormitory, waiting for it to open. 

</p><p>There are five girls and two boys. 

</p><p>Of the girls, there is one group of three and one group of two. 

</p><p>Both are engrossed in chatting and laughing, even though they’re about to head into the battlefield. 

</p><p>On the other hand, the boys were in different grades; one in Year One and the other in Year Three, playing with their phones without any sign of approaching each other. 

</p><p>It seems that they are acting alone. 

</p><p>While it is quite possible that they are heading to the electronics store, it’s hard to believe that they are going for a yogurt maker.

</p><p>The Year One boy is slightly obese, wears glasses and is holding his phone horizontally with both hands. 

</p><p>Further, he’s busily sliding and tapping his fingers, so it seems like he is playing a phone game.

</p><p>If so, it is highly likely that he is targeting gaming machines or gaming software.

</p><p>However…

One thing felt strange.

</p><p>Why don’t I see any of my classmates here?

</p><p>I took out my phone and opened up the group chat from yesterday. 

</p><p>Many people, both boys and girls, were saying that they were going to the electronics store today to buy the things they were looking for.

</p><p>Among them, there was a message from Hondou, who was excited that something he had been wanting for a long time was on the advertisement.

</p><p>I have no interest in that product, but it seems that competition for it definitely isn’t low.

</p><p>There were also many people worried whether they could rush into the store in time to buy what they wanted, and some warned others not to oversleep.

</p><p>My phone’s clock shifted to 9:56 a.m.

</p><p>The opening hour is approaching. 

</p><p>However, I can’t see Hondou anywhere, and neither can I see any other classmates.

</p><p>Yet, according to the chat, many people should be here right now.

</p><p>“...What’s going on?”

</p><p>It feels strange that the students who should have been here are not.

</p><p>Among the 7 people that are here, none of them looks to be excited or anxious.

</p><p>Shouldn’t they be lined up at the entrance ready to fight for even a second’s advantage?

</p><p>Can they really afford to leisurely play phone games?

</p><p>I felt uneasy, so I decided to be brave and check the situation.

</p><p>“Do you have a moment?”

</p><p>The Year One student annoyedly looked up, and I saw that he was indeed playing a game.

</p><p>He tapped the stop button and the game stopped.

</p><p>I can easily tell that he’s annoyed about a senior talking to him, but I have no choice as I have to check the situation.

</p><p>“What did you come to Keyaki Mall for?”

</p><p>“Huh? What, are you pretending this is some kind of television program..? I don’t understand what you’re trying to do.”

</p><p>“...Huh?”

</p><p>I tried to speak to him as naturally as possible to not scare him, but he seems to have raised his guard by about three levels.

</p><p>There is no time left to waste, however, so I have no choice but to cut to the chase.

</p><p>“I thought you might have come here to check out the sale at the electronics store. I heard they have some cheap gaming machines.”

</p><p>I tried to emphasize the game part as much as possible to get the point across.

</p><p>After that, he reacted in a way that seemed like he now understood my intent.

</p><p>“That would be pretty good if the gaming machines were the newest stuff, but it’s an unpopular version with an old LCD display and a fragile controller. It might be a big sale, but they’re just getting rid of inventory. Even if they sell old, unpopular game software at a discount of 20-30%, it’s still not good enough. Besides, I’m the type who buys download versions.”

</p><p>“...”

</p><p>I see.

</p><p>I get what he’s talking about, but I also don’t understand it.

</p><p>“A manga I want, releases today, so I’m just going to the bookstore. Oh, are you wondering why I buy paperbacks even though I only buy download versions of games?”

</p><p>“Umm, no…”

</p><p>“It’s true that you can buy the electronic version as soon as it’s past midnight, and you can read it on your phone or tablet any time you want, but I like the feel of a book in my hands. I’d say I’m the type of person who wants to keep manga and novels on paper forever. Like I said though, this is just limited to manga and novels, and I have little resistance to ebooks for other things as well. For example, a collection of a year’s worth of best-to-buy products, or photo books and such. I can tolerate that kind of thing. Well, I used paper versions of those in middle school too, though. I have had a lot more chances to use my phone or tablet since I entered this school, so I decided to move on. Oh, can I go now? I wanna do my best while there’s an event in this game.”

</p><p>I wanted to listen to him properly, but 20% of it is already gone from my mind.

</p><p>I think my brain was refusing to memorize his words because of his poor articulation.

</p><p>He finished talking about something I never even asked him, and resumed using his phone.

</p><p>The hour is 9:58 a.m.

</p><p>It should be about time for familiar students or students going for the sale to appear now, but…

Maybe this didn’t draw as much attention as I thought it would?

</p><p>I heard that last year’s sale was a roaring success, however, and starting with Hondou, my classmates seemed to be eagerly waiting for it.

</p><p>Could I have mistaken the date?

</p><p>It said ‘tomorrow’ in the chat, but isn’t there a possibility that it could be wrong?

</p><p>Or, since the conversation took place just before the date changed, it could have been tomorrow from today’s perspective. 

</p><p>I was beginning to think that way.

</p><p>Then, I hurriedly took out my phone and accessed the web ad again.

</p><p>“...It’s today.”

</p><p>The chance of this being a misunderstanding instantly disappeared.

</p><p>It’s getting closer and closer to the opening, but the number of students gathered has not increased by even one person.

</p><p>What’s going on..?

</p><p>No, I should stop thinking about it already.

</p><p>I’m going to directly head for the electronics store after it opens and buy my yogurt maker.

</p><p>That should be good enough.

</p><p>“By the way, Aiko sent me a photo just now. Look, there’s a crazy line at the north entrance.”

</p><p>“Wow. I went last year too. I couldn’t buy anything I wanted though, since there wasn’t enough stock. Wait, why the north entrance though?”

</p><p>“There was someone from B Class who got hurt at the opening rush last year, right?”

</p><p>“Ah, there was, I think it was pretty bad since everyone else was rushing in and ignored it.”

</p><p>“Yeah. So it looks like they’re lining up at the north entrance this year to be guided in by staff.”

</p><p>The reality that I want to hear, but also don’t want to hear reached my ears.

</p><p>As I learned the truth, the hour cruelly reached 10:00 a.m.
