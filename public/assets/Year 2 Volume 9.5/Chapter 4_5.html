    <h3>Part 5</h3>
    <p>
        This evening, I performed the opening ceremony of a mail-order product I received: a yogurt maker I got for
        3,000 Yen.

    </p>
    <p>I read through the thin instruction manual and mastered its use by actually touching the machine.

    </p>
    <p>Then, I did what I had to do and bought the necessary milk and yogurt.

    </p>
    <p>“Alright, let’s do this.”

    </p>
    <p>I never thought about it that deeply, but making yogurt is very simple.

    </p>
    <p>You take 100 ml out of a 1 liter carton of milk.

    </p>
    <p>You can drink the rest of the milk or use it for cooking. I chose to drink it this time.

    </p>
    <p>Then, you put 100 grams of yogurt into the space left in the milk carton.

    </p>
    <p>Now, the ratio of milk to yogurt is 9:1, so all that’s left to do is to set the yogurt maker.

    </p>
    <p>The timer is set for 9 hours, which means that all the milk in the milk carton will be yogurt when the time is
        up.

    </p>
    <p>I’d usually advise one to buy regular yogurt, but the machine’s real value will become apparent after the second
        time and in the long run.

    </p>
    <p>I can eat 1000 grams of yogurt the next morning, but the important thing is to leave 100 grams.

    </p>
    <p>Then, you can continue to keep buying new milk and mixing it to continue planting for new batches of yogurt.

    </p>
    <p>Lactic-acid bacilli are a scary thing.

    </p>
    <p>I know about this as knowledge, but I can actually feel it by starting to make it like this. I’ve just turned the
        switch on, so I may be getting ahead of myself, but…

        So, that’s all the good parts, but it would be easy enough to keep repeating this forever.

    </p>
    <p>Milk is fermented by lactic-acid bacilli and converted into yogurt, but it’s inevitable that the action of the
        lactic-acid bacilli weakens over time.

    </p>
    <p>As a result, the solidification of yogurt becomes weaker, and to avoid this, you need to ferment for longer but
        then the seed lactic-acid bacilli are lost even more.

    </p>
    <p>I’m going to take care of the hygiene, but there are inevitable things such as germs floating in the air, which
        weaken the function of the lactic-acid bacilli.

    </p>
    <p>After all, it should be finished after three items, or four at most.

    </p>
    <p>I can just make it myself and experience it to get a sense of it.

    </p>
    <p>Enjoying this is one of the pleasures of making your own yogurt.

    </p>
    <p>I set the timer for 9:00, which means that the yogurt will be ready at 6 in the morning.

    </p>
    <p>“Let’s see.”

    </p>
    <p>I took my phone out of the charger on my bed.

    </p>
    <p>I was about to call Kei, but… I received a phone call while trying to find her in my call history.

    </p>
    <p>For a moment, I thought Kei lost her patience and called me, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s pretty rare for you to call me, Satou.”

    </p>
    <p>“Umm, I just really wanted to ask you something, but…”

    </p>
    <p>“What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>“It’s about Kei-chan.”

    </p>
    <p>It’s not hard to see why she would be concerned as her close friend.

    </p>
    <p>She probably wants to learn my feelings without telling Kei about it.

    </p>
    <p>“About Kei? What do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>For now, I just threw her a check ball.

    </p>
    <p>“You… had a fight recently, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Is that what you heard?”

    </p>
    <p>“Well, yeah. I gathered as much from chatting with her.”

    </p>
    <p>She may have found it difficult to say that she was explicitly asked for advice, so she said that she noticed
        some things while talking with Kei instead.

    </p>
    <p>“It’s almost the end of the year, so… You’re going to make up with her, right?”

    </p>
    <p>Rather than doubting that I would meet with Kei, she was more concerned about what would happen when I did.

    </p>
    <p>She’s probably worried about Kei after sensing something wrong with her.

    </p>
    <p>I don’t know how this phone call will affect her, but for now, I’d like to appreciate the fact that she’s
        thinking about her close friend.

    </p>
    <p>“I was just about to call Kei to talk about our promise.”

    </p>
    <p>“R-Really? That means you’re going to make up, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s my intent, of course. As long as Kei doesn’t have any plans and doesn’t refuse me, of course.”

    </p>
    <p>We promised in advance, but we never reconfirmed it.

    </p>
    <p>It’s only natural that I can’t force her to meet me at my convenience.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, I haven’t received any notification of her having personal business until now, so I assume that the
        appointment will be fulfilled and that there will not be any problems.

    <p>
        An almost gasping voice reached my ears from the other end of the phone.

    </p>
    <p>“I-I’m so relieved! Mhm, that’s great! I don’t wanna bother you, so I’ll end the call now!”

    </p>
    <p>Deciding that chatting with me on the phone any further would only cause anxiety for Kei, she decided to hang up.

    </p>
    <p>“Wait a bit. There’s something I want to tell you.”

    </p>
    <p>“What is it?”

    </p>
    <p>Satou is very cheerful now that she knows I’m about to call Kei.

    </p>
    <p>She’s a girl with a strong heart who can support others without regard to her own feelings.

    </p>
    <p>“As her boyfriend, it’s true that I’m in a position where I’m supposed to protect Kei.”

    </p>
    <p>“What do you mean?”

    </p>
    <p>“There’s no telling when and where she might end up in trouble. It’s not just about romance, right? Problems can
        occur in friendships too, and there’s a unique risk of expulsion in this school. Just like how you felt uneasy
        about me and Kei, there’s no telling when and how personal relationships might crumble. Even if you have
        absolute peace of mind, that can change into unease the moment you see a crack in the relationship.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s…”

    </p>
    <p>I’m sure Satou can’t deny this truth.

    </p>
    <p>Satou must have felt relieved when the relationship between Kei and I was established and acknowledged.

    </p>
    <p>Ayanokoji will protect Kei, he will take care of her.

    </p>
    <p>She must have been confident about that.

    </p>
    <p>However, one unexpected situation made her feel upset and anxious.

    </p>
    <p>That’s why she took the risk of making this call on her own.

    </p>
    <p>“As a friend, no, as one of her closest friends, you have to support Kei. Of course, this is assuming that this
        is how you think of Kei.”

    </p>
    <p>“That’s obvious!”

    </p>
    <p>Satou declared that she would protect Kei without a pause.

    </p>
    <p>“That’s good to hear, then. However, I’ll guarantee the opposite of that as well.”

    </p>
    <p>“...Opposite?”

    </p>
    <p>“If you ever can’t protect Kei, then I will.”

    </p>
    <p>“I can… believe you, right?”

    </p>
    <p>“Of course.”

    </p>
    <p>My true intentions, true nature and true feelings are irrelevant.

    </p>
    <p>That’s what I should make Satou think right now, and sign this unseen contract.

    </p>
    <p>This increases the possibility of Satou continuing to help her even if I abandon Kei.

    </p>
    <p>If Satou ends up getting expelled, there’s no guarantee for her that I would continue protecting Kei after that.

    </p>
    <p>She can’t hold a grudge against me even if I break the promise.

    </p>
    <p>Most of all, Kei is currently an important piece in maintaining Horikita’s class.

    </p>
    <p>“Kei told me that she was meeting with you today. She said she wanted to thank you.”

    </p>
    <p>“Ah, that’s right.”

    </p>
    <p>“Thanks.”

    </p>
    <p>“I, I don’t need a thank you. All I want is for you two to get along.”

    </p>
    <p>“I see. You can ask Kei what happened tomorrow, then.”

    </p>
    <p>“I’ll get ready to listen to her boasting about her love life.”

    </p>
    <p>I felt a slight change of mind in the empty room after finishing the call.

    </p>
    <p>Manipulating others with my words.

    </p>
    <p>It is an action that I categorize as ‘fun’ for me.

    </p>
    <p>It doesn’t matter if what I say is true or false.

    </p>
    <p>Even the statements of someone trying to manipulate me must feel ‘fun’.

    </p>
    <p>In fact, I would rather welcome being unwittingly deceived.

    </p>
    <p>To know and to learn people.

    </p>
    <p>To be learned.

    </p>
    <p>Bigger, stranger, or gigantic opponents.

    </p>
    <p>I can’t help but find enjoyment in manipulating and controlling such people. Still, Satou has gradually improved
        her skills too.

    </p>
    <p>I can see her growth even in a single phone call.

    </p>
    <p>“Now then…”

    </p>
    <p>It was slightly past the appointed time, but I decided to call Kei.
