    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
    <h2>The Meeting Before The Festival</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
        The days go by quickly, and Friday came, November 12. The day before the festival after
        school arrived.
    </p>
    <p>Each class has been working on preparations for the festival. The student council will be leading
        the rehearsal this afternoon after school. It will serve as a crucial measure for how well We
        perform tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>With a few exceptions, all of the other students immediately started moving to start making
        preparations. Horikita's class has a total of four stalls.
    </p>
    <p>The first is the well-known maid cafe, where tea, coffee, and other beverages are the main sales
        along with photoshoot with the maids.
    </p>
    <p>The latter sales strategy will be a major source of earnings if there are numerous clients
        because it is time-efficient and the unit price is set high.
    </p>
    <p>The second and third are outdoor food stands that sell Western-style pasta and bread as well as
        powdered foods (takoyaki, okonomiyaki, etc.). The stalls themselves generate sales, and the
        maid cafe also accepts orders.
    </p>
    <p>A student in charge of delivery goes to the stall when an order is placed and brings it to the
        customers here in maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>In order to take advantage of the maid cafe’s originality, a limited food menu is also prepared,
    </p>
    <p>which is a slight modification of the existing menu offered at the food stall.
    </p>
    <p>And finally, the fourth and final event is an outdoor quiz competition for children, which was
        added on short notice with the extra budget.
    </p>
    <p>"You guys didn’t make Hasebe-san and Miyake-kun come?"
    </p>
    <p>Maezono asked as her eyes followed Haruka and Akito, who had just left the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>"There's no point in forcing them to do anything. Let's consider this a good opportunity to test
        whether 35 people, excluding Koenji-kun, Hasebe and Miyake, can be left alone without any
        problems."
    </p>
    <p>But those three are not the only ones who are not willing to cooperate.
    </p>
    <p>In the weeks prior to the festival, Kushida barely interfered with any of the sessions and she has
        been leaving school right away without helping.
    </p>
    <p>She has visited Horikita several times to come up with new ideas because she is aware that she
        will be in charge of serving the customers as a maid at the festival. while they are only tiny
        components, some of them have even been adopted.
    </p>
    <p>However, she did not participate in any practice sessions with other maids to make sure they
        were all on the same page.
    </p>
    <p>"I'd like to do some final checks for tomorrow's event and also practice my activities for the day.
    </p>
    <p>Do you think you'll have time today?"
    </p>
    <p>Sato called out, somewhat bravely, trying as much as possible not to let her guard down.
    </p>
    <p>Kushida, who had just gotten up from her seat, stopped and turned around on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, Sato-san. I have something I really can't miss after school."
    </p>
    <p>This was not the first time Kushida has said that.
    </p>
    <p>"Listen, you keep refusing me like that. When are you seriously going to cooperate?"
    </p>
    <p>The atmosphere was turning sour, and Horikita was about to get up from her seat, but Yosuke,
    </p>
    <p>who was standing beside her, stopped her as if he had anticipated this.
    </p>
    <p>I don't know who was right.
    </p>
    <p>However, it's impossible to create a smooth class if we interfere in everything.
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes things have to be resolved by the people involved.
    </p>
    <p>Yosuke's actions can be described as out of character because he typically is the one to stand
        out to anyone else…
        Probably because he felt that unnecessarily showing Horikita’s special treatment towards
        Kushida to the class was a bad move.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, Horikita understood this, but she also had a dilemma that she couldn’t leave alone.
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry, I've got the festival in mind, and I'm not going to drag the class down."
    </p>
    <p>"But, Kushida-san, you haven't practised, not even a little. I can't trust you with the important
        role of a maid."
    </p>
    <p>Today’s rehearsal will be the perfect practice.
    </p>
    <p>Sato, who had been reluctant to participate, seems unable to back down today.
    </p>
    <p>Likewise, Kushida had been even more reluctant and it doesn’t seem like she will budge today
        as well.
    </p>
    <p>"Then why don't you remove me? I don't think there are any other decent candidates."
    </p>
    <p>A merciless remark, but a fair one.
    </p>
    <p>Even taking Kushida’s appearance into consideration, a student who isn’t currently playing the
        role of a maid wouldn't be able to serve as a substitute.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll see you tomorrow at the festival. Bye."
    </p>
    <p>Although she spoke in a kind tone, unlike previous Kushida, her actions may be interpreted as
        being harsh.
    </p>
    <p>Until the very end, she turned down Sato's proposal and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>Did she simply not want to spend time with classmates who know her true nature?
    </p>
    <p>Or was it really that she had something she can't miss?
    </p>
    <p>Obviously, the atmosphere in the classroom deteriorated, but that can't be helped.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, Horikita-san. Tomorrow's the festival, but I still think we should remove Kushida-san after
        all..."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, unable to bear the sight of Sato’s downcast and frustrated face, went directly to
        Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>"I know what you mean. But I don't intend to remove her at the moment."
    </p>
    <p>"But it's a lie that she has to do things every day, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida's recent actions have been, in fact, somewhat mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>She hasn't been interacting with others since the unanimous special exam, which is
        unavoidable, but her lack of cooperation has been evident,
    </p>
    <p>"That may be so. I don't know why she doesn't participate in practice either."
    </p>
    <p>"Then..."
    </p>
    <p>"Don’t worry. She's thinking about the festival and the maid cafe in her own way. Just believe in
        Kushida-san."
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I guess you could say that we won’t get anywhere if I don't believe in her..."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita looked unconvinced, but nodded and turned to follow Satō.
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, perhaps because she was one of the founding members this time, was also making
        a lot of efforts.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita's attitude didn't convey any anxiety, despite the fact that Kushida's absence from
        practise is a cause for concern.
    </p>
    <p>It appeared to be peering out with reasonable confidence, instead.
    </p>
    <p>That's most likely the reason Matsushita retreated.
    </p>
    <p>Let's wait and see because it didn't appear like she was in need of help.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        On the first floor of the special building, stall number "Special 02".
    </p>
    <p>This area, which was typically utilised as an empty classroom, was being decorated by students.
    </p>
    <p>The girls, it turned out, were by far the greatest at this kind of decoration.
    </p>
    <p>The boys helped the girls out with some of the work.
    </p>
    <p>With Horikita in the lead, it's probably safe to let them handle the setup.
    </p>
    <p>Preparations for the concept cafe were steadily underway in the back of the special classroom
        on the second floor.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike our maid cafe, the concept of Ryuen’s class was "Traditional Japanese style."
    </p>
    <p>The food and beverages were also completely different from ours, including Japanese sweets
        and tea.
    </p>
    <p>While preparations were underway, we found a unique presence.
    </p>
    <p>There was a girl sitting alone in a chair reading a book dressed in a kimono.
    </p>
    <p>"... Good day."
    </p>
    <p>When she noticed me, Hiyori lifted her book and, for some reason, hid everything but her gaze.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image5.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        "Long time no see. I hear you haven’t turned up at the library lately?"
    </p>
    <p>"That’s not true. It’s a bit, I mean, I’m there at a different time now."
    </p>
    <p>I found it strange that a bookworm would leave the library, but I believe she simply shifted the
        times when she was visiting.
    </p>
    <p>"So, you are going to work at the store as well?"
    </p>
    <p>"I am just working as the cashier. I’m not especially good at talking with people… nor with
        walking around. I have practiced carrying the trays with food, but that didn’t go well."
    </p>
    <p>In short, she’s not very good at anything in general.
    </p>
    <p>However, working as a cashier isn’t hard and if she can handle it smoothly, it’ll be fine.
    </p>
    <p>"By the way, Ibuki-san is also participating."
    </p>
    <p>"Ibuki? But she’s not the kind of person who would ever wear that outfit, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"It seems she made a bet with Ryuen-kun to be completely exempted from the cultural festival."
    </p>
    <p>"And she lost."
    </p>
    <p>Hiyori smiled a little funny as if she was remembering that time.
    </p>
    <p>"So, where is this Ibuki who lost?"
    </p>
    <p>"She's not participating today. She said she absolutely hates wearing it outside of the festival."
    </p>
    <p>I can understand that feeling, but I hope she can serve her customers well when she goes out
        on the spot. Well, Ryuen would deal with such matters in a flexible manner.
    </p>
    <p>I wanted to check on Ryūen, who owns the restaurant, but I couldn't see him. I wondered if he
        left the rehearsal preparations to other students.
    </p>
    <p>"It seems that Ryuen-kun went to check Class A."
    </p>
    <p>"Class A?"
    </p>
    <p>"Because they haven’t disclosed what kind of presentation they were going to put on."
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, the details of Sakayanagi’s class had been unknown until the day before the festival.
    </p>
    <p>It's not strange to want to find out what they will be doing.
    </p>
    <p>As long as all the classes were participating in this pre-opening the day before, there was no
        doubt that they would be preparing to open a stall somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to go over there for a bit too."
    </p>
    <p>After talking with Hiyori, I decided to look for Sakayanagi's class.
    </p>
    <p>"Um, Ayanokoji-kun..."
    </p>
    <p>"Hmm?"
    </p>
    <p>"Ryuen and the others went up to the third floor, so I think that's where Sakayanagi-san
        probably went."
    </p>
    <p>"I see, that saves me the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>She seemed to want to say something else, but Hiyori immediately shook her head from side to
        side.
    </p>
    <p>Three second-year classes concentrated in a special wing, and yet they are on different floors?
    </p>
    <p>"I'll be at the library again, so please do come, Ayanokoji-kun."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, I will."
    </p>
    <p>I raised my hand to say goodbye, and then walked up to the third floor.
    </p>
    <p>The third floor of the special wing is the farthest from the school gate and the hardest to reach.
    </p>
    <p>There were three classrooms available here, but until the previous day, they were not popular
        and had not been rented.
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't think that Sakayanagi’s class would rent everything there, though."
    </p>
    <p>As it's currently an exclusive floor, the 2nd year Class A students roamed the third floor
        corridors as they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>At first glance, it's hard to imagine what kind of display they are trying to put on.
    </p>
    <p>The students were still wearing their school uniforms, and there were only a few cardboard
        boxes scattered around with their contents kept hidden from sight.
    </p>
    <p>Since it’s impossible to cook indoors due to fire regulations, that field disappears.
    </p>
    <p>"Surprised by the unexpected?"
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto, who was supposedly keeping an eye on the students coming, approached and
        called out.
    </p>
    <p>"What's this all about?"
    </p>
    <p>"You can't even understand what you’re seeing?"
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto laughed quietly, perhaps amused that I didn't grasp it.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, that's understandable. But I can't answer you easily."
    </p>
    <p>They probably want to wrap things up for preparations the day before, but they don't want to
        reveal them.
    </p>
    <p>On the stairs going to this floor, a sign was displayed as if to signify this.
    </p>
    <p>It read, "Due to an issue, the second-year Class A will not be presenting their activities today."
    </p>
    <p>"That's what it means. I'm sorry you had to come all the way up here, but I'm going to have to
        ask you to leave."
    </p>
    <p>Even if I persisted, I would still not be able to find out the details of the exhibit.
    </p>
    <p>"It looks like Ryuen will be leaving soon, too."
    </p>
    <p>With his hands in his pockets, Ryuen moved toward us after exiting a classroom at the back.
    </p>
    <p>He gave Hashimoto and I a brief glance before proceeding straight through and downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>"Or are you going to do the same as him and take a closer look, even if you know it's useless?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going back."
    </p>
    <p>"Good luck. You’ll have to wait until we open to see what happens."
    </p>
    <p>I was on my way back to the second floor when I noticed that Ryuen had turned his back to face
        me and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>I shifted my gaze and looked into his eyes directly.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen raised the corner of his mouth slightly before opening it.
    </p>
    <p>"Tell Suzune that it will be our class that wins tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>"I bet the Japanese attire cost more than the maid uniforms, didn't they? If you're going to
        challenge her to a match, at that point, you could have just worked together."
    </p>
    <p>"It's simply my taste."
    </p>
    <p>After replying with words that could be taken either seriously or jokingly, Ryuen started walking
        away.
    </p>
    <p>Without paying attention to Hashimoto's presence from the upper floor, I also turned back to the
        maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        Surprisingly, many boys from other classes rushed to the restaurant as soon as it opened.
    </p>
    <p>There seemed to be more onlookers who wanted to catch a glimpse of the girls in cosplay
        rather than eating, which was fine with us.
    </p>
    <p>The maids, who aren't used to being the focus of attention, would benefit from the experience.
    </p>
    <p>Even Matsushita, who was always very composed, exhibited some stiffness and showed signs
        of nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>Sato and Mii-chan's movements seemed to be much more sluggish than during practice.
    </p>
    <p>Immediately afterward, the sound of plastic bouncing on the floor spread throughout the
        classroom.
    </p>
    <p>It was caused by Mii-chan slipping a glass of water on the tray.
    </p>
    <p>The heavy incident that seemed to split the air caused the person in question to freeze.
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita was the one who moved first amid all of this.
    </p>
    <p>"I am terribly sorry."
    </p>
    <p>After gently patting Mii-chan on the shoulder with a calm tone, she instructed her to bring fresh
        water.
    </p>
    <p>Then she brought a rag to clean the floor.
    </p>
    <p>"You’re doing very well, Matsushita-san, I can't believe it's your very first time as a maid."
    </p>
    <p>"Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, who was standing by and watching, was also impressed by Matsushita's outstanding
        actions.
    </p>
    <p>"You're also participating tomorrow as a maid, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Basically, as a manager. I'll also serve customers depending on the situation, but I'm honestly
        not sure."
    </p>
    <p>Unlike usual, Horikita answered somewhat timidly.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, no one thinks you're good at putting on a smile, so good luck." I said turning to Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>I'm sure she's not worried about the service itself, but offering a smile can be a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>"You look pretty comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>"It's almost like the work over here will be done by today."
    </p>
    <p>It's like 90% prep and 10% production, and all we have to do tomorrow is the paperwork.
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe I should reassign you to the stalls too."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't reassign me just because of a personal gripe."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita started to say something nasty, but quickly backed down because she wasn’t serious.
    </p>
    <p>"For now, it looks like Matsushita-san will be fine, and I'll be leaving for a bit."
    </p>
    <p>"You're going to observe?"
    </p>
    <p>"I want to see with my own eyes what kind of entertainment there will be."
    </p>
    <p>"Take your time."
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, I would work on making room for tomorrow's waiting room.
    </p>
    <p>About an hour later, Horikita returned to the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm back. How are things going?"
    </p>
    <p>"There were a few minor mistakes, but now we're all settled in and getting used to everything."
    </p>
    <p>"Thanks for the advance preparation."
    </p>
    <p>Without this preparation, if we had just gone out and wing it, we might have been in danger.
    </p>
    <p>I was aware that doing it in front of an audience of outside observers was entirely different than
        rehearsing without them.
    </p>
    <p>Since the doors were opened, Matsushita, who had been operating at full capacity, had rounded
        up and approached me.
    </p>
    <p>"Good job Matsushita-san. I’m honestly surprised how well you performed."
    </p>
    <p>"Thanks. Everyone's getting better. We should be able to start tomorrow in good shape."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita said, though her expression was a little stiff.
    </p>
    <p>"What's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>"I think there might be more sabotage, that's what I'm a little worried about."
    </p>
    <p>"Sabotage?"
    </p>
    <p>"When Ryuen-kun's class came over to the maid cafe, I was afraid they'd bring Ishizaki-kun and
        the others over and say there were bugs in the cups or something..."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita and I exchanged glances for a moment, then quickly turned our attention back to
        Matsushita.
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry about that. It's not in their best interest to interfere in the practice stage. Besides,
    </p>
    <p>since there is a rule that students can't be guests in the activities, they can't do such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>"Ryuen can't use his usual tactics in the presence of so many eyes at the exhibit. There is no
        need to worry." I added to Horikita's explanation.
    </p>
    <p>The smile returned to Matsushita's face as she was almost simultaneously told by both of us
        that there isn't anything to worry about.
    </p>
    <p>"Somehow, when the two of you say it, I feel a different sense of relief."
    </p>
    <p>She patted her chest in relief, as if she had been somewhat preoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>"You should take a break too."
    </p>
    <p>"I guess I'll do that."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita stumbled a little as she attempted to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>"Did you notice that?"
    </p>
    <p>"Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, it's nothing."
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps because it was a minor discomfort, Horikita, who was nearby, did not seem to notice
        anything in particular.
    </p>
    <p>I hope I'm just imagining things.
    </p>
    <p>"So how did it go? What did the other classes put on?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know if there will be another festival next year, but I learned a lot."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita examined the completed room before leaving to check its condition.
    </p>
    <p>"It looks fine. In another hour, we'll start cleaning up, and you should take another look too."
    </p>
    <p>"I'll let you do that."
    </p>
    <p>With permission, I decided to parade around the entire school.
    </p>
    <p>Kei appeared as if she had been waiting for that moment and took me in arms.
    </p>
    <p>"Let's go together."
    </p>
    <p>"I’d rather not but I don't think you're going to leave me."
    </p>
    <p>"I won't leave you."
    </p>
    <p>"You're free to go together, but remember that you are only scouting."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, yes~"
    </p>
    <p>While Horikita responded seriously every time, Kei seemed to be at ease from start to finish.
    </p>
    <p>Well, it's not every day you get a chance like this.
    </p>
    <p>In fact, even taking a look at the maid cafe, it seemed as if most of the others were enjoying the
        cultural festival in a normal way.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        First-year students and some of the third-year students were putting on a number of
        performances that resembled festival stalls.
    </p>
    <p>Some of them involved technological intervention, such as target practice, ring toss, or dropping
        marbles on a handmade platform to win prizes at multiple goals.
    </p>
    <p>The collection of prizes made the scene look a bit like a festival hall.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, it's Yukimura-kun and the others!"
    </p>
    <p>Kei was the first to point and found Keisei, Sotomura, and the other boys busily preparing for the
        event.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps because they had practiced baking food in their dormitories, they seemed to be doing it
        with a certain degree of dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>Let's not interrupt them by talking to them carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>"Shall we try our hand at ring toss?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'll try! Oh, that stuffed animal is kind of cute. I might want one."
    </p>
    <p>Kei shouted and pointed from behind a student who was experiencing it first. It was a cute prize,
    </p>
    <p>a colorful bear.
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, however, the ring toss was a demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>Even if they succeeded in the ring toss, they wouldn't receive any prizes.
    </p>
    <p>Even though the student council had a budget for the event, the number of prizes were limited.
    </p>
    <p>If students took the prizes home today, it will be difficult to replenish them.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, the shooting game that the 1st year Class B was putting on across the street
        seemed to be offering sweets as prizes, and they were giving them away if guests were
        successful.
    </p>
    <p>The prizes were cheap, starting at 10 points, and even the most expensive ones were worth
        about 200 points.
    </p>
    <p>I guess tommorow there will be prizes other than sweets, but this way, the test would be as
        good as the real thing.
    </p>
    <p>"Try it, Kiyotaka!"
    </p>
    <p>She urged me to try it and lightly pushed me in front of a table where five shooting guns were
        placed in a row.
    </p>
    <p>I was interested in the target shooting game, so I was willing to give it a try. You're given five
        bullets per game.
    </p>
    <p>The gun seemed to be a type of toy called a cork gun, which was filled with cork and fires.
    </p>
    <p>Each of the guns lined up on the table seemed to be more heavily built than I had expected.
    </p>
    <p>The bullets, however, were distorted in shape, and it was doubtful that they can be shot with
        precision.
    </p>
    <p>I had never held a gun in my hands since I was born.
    </p>
    <p>I have a vague image of it from movies and TV dramas, but I am not sure if it’s really true to the
        actual thing.
    </p>
    <p>I can't even look at an example because there were no other students participating in the event.
    </p>
    <p>So, from my imagination, I grabbed the gun in the middle of the room and held it up.
    </p>
    <p>"Aim for the most expensive one."
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image4.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        In order to drop the highest priced assortment of candy, I need to shoot down a large weight. I
        wonder how powerful it really is. Let's give it a try first.
    </p>
    <p>The first shot was fired while receiving enthusiastic cheers from Kei.
    </p>
    <p>With a light "pop" sound, the cork bullet was fired and approached the weight I had set as my
        target.
    </p>
    <p>However, the bullet passed through a few centimeters to the left of the weight without delay.
    </p>
    <p>My perceived aim was that it should have hit the target with pinpoint accuracy, but the trajectory
        was completely different.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I shifted the muzzle a few centimeters to the right and fired a second shot. I thought I had
        corrected the trajectory perfectly, but this time it passed diagonally to the right and missed.
    </p>
    <p>"This is pretty hard..."
    </p>
    <p>As I was loading the third shot, the other students began to join in one by one. I decided to
        watch the other students and try to further correct the trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>However, the students firing their guns were struggling to aim as well as I was.
    </p>
    <p>One of the students fired a shot, which from the first shot struck a weight. He was able to push it
        back, but it did not fall.
    </p>
    <p>As I kept watching to see if there was a trick to it, I realised that it wasn't my skill at play, but
        rather the fact that each gun, despite its similar appearance, performed differently.
    </p>
    <p>The production process's millimeter-to-millimeter variations and the bullet cork's own quality.
    </p>
    <p>With each shot, a number of factors came together to produce an unusual trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>Although it was a really intriguing mechanism, I was also aware of how challenging it was to
        shoot and drop the target.
    </p>
    <p>Only the final shot, which was not an easy target to hit, was able to strike the weight that I had
        initially aiming at, so my first target shooting was a complete failure.
    </p>
    <p>However, I was now aware of the gun's inclination.
    </p>
    <p>Now, if I could just estimate the bullet's flight path from the cork's shape, I could do it again.
    </p>
    <p>That's what I initially believed, but I quickly changed my mind after seeing a sign that read, "Only
        one challenge per person today."
    </p>
    <p>"Ha~.Even Ayanokoji-paisen, I mean is really bad at shooting?"
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here Hosen used the word ‘Paisen’ which is a funny way to say senpai. It’s a slang
        and sounds not too serious. Only used if you don’t care much about giving respect to a senpai
        or if you are friendly with them, or (in some cases) when you want to praise in a sarcastic way. ]
        [ TL Note 2 : In the same sentence, Hosen choose a certain word called ‘Sasuga’. Normally this
        word translates to ‘As Expected‘ (or here ‘Even’) and is generally associated with giving a
        compliment but it’s not always a compliment and when it’s not, there are more subtleties to this
        word. So, When it’s not a Compliment it has a Contradictory use. Means when someone is
        having bad result even though a good result is expected from them. And it heavily implies that
        the Contradiction (bad result) is happening because of a Special, Inevitable reason. This word
        here is giving us hint that this thing happened because of an inevitable reason. So, in short the
        word ‘Sasuga’ implies that some inevitable thing caused an unexpected result. It tells you that
        Something is up. Since Hosen used this word here, it implies that he knows about something
        that others don’t and that’s why he choose this word. ]
        Just as I put my gun back, Hosen came out from behind the stall, laughing with a funny smile on
        his face. Hosen's first year Class D stalls specialized in "games."
    </p>
    <p>"I am surprised. You’re doing something like this.."
    </p>
    <p>This is a game in which adults return to their childhood memories and enthusiastically win trivial
        prizes at target practice and ring tossing.
    </p>
    <p>"When I was a kid, I used to make a living with the adults at these kinda stalls."
    </p>
    <p>What the heck kind of childhood was that...
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Thoughts : I feel like Ayanokoji should be the last one to say this considering his own
        ‘childhood’ ]
        "I really wanted to do more serious gambling, but the school turned me down for some strict
        rules. But target shooting or not, It's the same thing as gambling. This kinda gambling is
        designed so that the house can win about all the time. It's a one-time cultural festival, and
        there’s no way to be careful about when you get ripped off."
    </p>
    <p>He took out his lighter and put it on the shelf, then came over to this side of the table and picked
        up the second gun from the far left.
    </p>
    <p>The bullet fired from the projectile gun he held up flew straighter than I had imagined and hit the
        lighter. It shook, but showed no sign of falling over.
    </p>
    <p>"As long as they don’t take any of the limited prizes, it’s all good."
    </p>
    <p>"Wouldn’t that keep the customers from coming back?"
    </p>
    <p>"Not if we add value to the scrapy participation prizes and hand them out regularly."
    </p>
    <p>Hosen had a plan. If the participation prizes were not attractive, adults might shy away. What
        appeared to be a participation prize peeked out of the basket.
    </p>
    <p>They had prepared a large number of student photos, both male and female, using a printing
        press and laminated them in various patterns for handmade prizes.
    </p>
    <p>"It's a good way to show off as an adult that you gotta memory of participatin’ in a cultural
        festival."
    </p>
    <p>The fact that many politician-related people will be attending means that some will communicate
        their participation in the festival as a kind of charity or community activity.
    </p>
    <p>If you announce that you got the photos of the Students, it will lead to a good impression.
    </p>
    <p>After parting ways with Hosen, who was surprisingly thinking things through, I returned to Kei,
    </p>
    <p>who was waiting for me.
    </p>
    <p>"It was impossible."
    </p>
    <p>Kei grined happily and poked me in the stomach area with her elbow.
    </p>
    <p>"You look pretty happy even though you didn't get any prizes."
    </p>
    <p>"Because I was able to see Kiyotaka's cute side. I'm super satisfied as far as I'm concerned."
    </p>
    <p>"What was ‘cute’ about it?"
    </p>
    <p>I had no good points at all during that time.
    </p>
    <p>"I was happy that it wasn't a manga-like development, where you hit it on the first shot. I realized
        again that you can't do everything."
    </p>
    <p>That's true. My approach was based on experience. Unless I had some material from my past
        experience to draw on, there was no way I was going to do well on my first shot, toy or
        otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>"That's cute, huh? I feel like you usually want your boyfriends to be cool."
    </p>
    <p>"I've been shown enough of that."
    </p>
    <p>She didn't blame me, but rather, Kei's emotions seemed to take pleasure in the fact that I didn't
        take the prize.
    </p>
    <p>As I strolled around looking for other interesting offerings, I spotted Ishizaki.
    </p>
    <p>"Yo, Ayanokoji!"
    </p>
    <p>"Looks like something kind of unusual is being put on."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, it is, isn't it? It's an idea of mine and Albert's, you know.
    </p>
    <p>"Really, how did an underling like you get permission from Ryuen? You couldn't even set up a
        birthday party."
    </p>
    <p>Kei stared at Ishizaki with suspicious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>"Uh…… I wanted to make it happen! But…… I made a proposal just like you asked and got
        kicked out……"
    </p>
    <p>He held his abdomen as if he was remembering that moment. It was coincidentally on October
        20, the day of my and Ryuen's birthdays.
    </p>
    <p>For both of us, Ishizaki planned a birthday party. Kei's demand was that Ryuen directly
        apologise to her for what he did on the rooftop and bow down to her in order for Ishizaki to be
        successful at persuading her.
    </p>
    <p>Naturally, Ryuen did not accept Kei's harsh conditions.
    </p>
    <p>"But I'll get my revenge next year! You'll just have to wait for me!"
    </p>
    <p>"No one's going to wait for you. So, what kind of booth are you putting up?"
    </p>
    <p>"Who cares? Do you care? Okay, you guys go ahead and give it a try."
    </p>
    <p>All that was provided was a desk and cardboard. The disposable chopsticks and cups on the
        table gave the impression of dining, but is it really?
    </p>
    <p>"What is this?"
    </p>
    <p>"You'll just have to wait and see."
    </p>
    <p>Ishizaki then instructed Albert to take out tools from a cardboard box.
    </p>
    <p>They were a bag of protein and a bag of citric acid. Both are familiar to those who take them
        during muscle training and other activities.
    </p>
    <p>"This is chocolate flavored protein. Well, just take a light lick."
    </p>
    <p>Two small bite-sized paper cups were prepared with Ishizaki's chocolateflavored protein.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't want it."
    </p>
    <p>Kei refused to drink it as soon as it was served.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, don't be like that. It's just protein."
    </p>
    <p>"I've never had protein before, and I don't want to. I'm not trying to get muscular.
    </p>
    <p>"You can't build muscle just by drinking protein shakes."
    </p>
    <p>Albert steped forward and mumbled English.
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? What?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry about that. You can't build muscle by just drinking protein shakes. That's right.
    </p>
    <p>Since we're here, why don't you two give it a try?"
    </p>
    <p>To be honest, I was a little curious to see what Ishizaki would do.
    </p>
    <p>I took the initiative, picked up a paper cup, and drank the protein.
    </p>
    <p>It may have been made by a different manufacturer than the one I used to drink, but it tasted a
        little like the old days.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I'll drink it for you then, just in case... it's bad."
    </p>
    <p>Kei, on the other hand, who drank protein for the first time, frowned as if it didn't taste good.
    </p>
    <p>"Tastes bad? Well, it's not undrinkable, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's not undrinkable, but I don't really want to drink it."
    </p>
    <p>"Well, you need a palate cleanser."
    </p>
    <p>Water was handed to me, perhaps to rinse out my mouth. By the time I finished drinking it,
    </p>
    <p>Ishizaki was ready to move on.
    </p>
    <p>"Next, this way."
    </p>
    <p>With that, he prepared a citric acid drink, this time in another paper cup.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, it’s citric acid, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>"I think I like this one better."
    </p>
    <p>We muttered our impressions of the citric acid drink to each other.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, that's the last one. The two you just drank aren't bad, are they?"
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't like the protein."
    </p>
    <p>"You're good, Karuizawa, how about Ayanokoji?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, it wasn't bad at all."
    </p>
    <p>Hearing this, Ishizaki laughed happily.
    </p>
    <p>"By the way. If you add citric acid to this chocolate-flavored protein, you get a very strange
        taste."
    </p>
    <p>He handed me the mixed protein and held it close to my mouth. It seemed like killing two birds
        with one stone, since both the protein intake and the citric acid intake are not bad.
    </p>
    <p>"Now drink both of them at the same time."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm kind of scared."
    </p>
    <p>"Well, let's drink it."
    </p>
    <p>We tipped our paper cups and started drinking.
    </p>
    <p>But the moment I put it in my mouth, I involuntarily stiffened at the taste spreading from the
        surface of my tongue.
    </p>
    <p>"Blaargh!"
    </p>
    <p>Kei screamed next to me and spat it out on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>She then made a vomiting gesture while thrashing about, strongly appealing the others.
    </p>
    <p>"This, that, that tastes like vomit! Eeh!"
    </p>
    <p>I also recalled that taste. My stomach was struck hard with a fist when I was learning martial
        arts, and the meal my body was digesting as well as the stomach acid both came up.
    </p>
    <p>The smell and taste that spread in my mouth, it was something close to that.
    </p>
    <p>"Hahaha! Yes! That's funny!"
    </p>
    <p>"Not funny! Water!!!"
    </p>
    <p>Pushing away Ishizaki, who was laughing exasperatingly, Kei drank from the water bottle
        "This is, how can I say this, certainly a mystery drink."
    </p>
    <p>"Even Ayanokoji is a bit taken back."
    </p>
    <p>Not only was it not tasty, but it honestly didn't taste edible.
    </p>
    <p>It became much less tense.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to surprise my customers tomorrow. For 500 points a cup, I'm going to offer them a
        magical experience."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm amazed that Ryuen allowed you to do this."
    </p>
    <p>I'm more surprised about that as well.
    </p>
    <p>"He said, 'Do whatever you want with your points. We're doing something else tomorrow.’"
    </p>
    <p>I see. So Ishizaki is just going to rent the extra space for himself.
    </p>
    <p>Then the expenses would be minimal, and, well, it's no wonder that about 10 guests would at
        least be curious about the experience.
    </p>
    <p>"Ugh, a fun date turned into the worst..."
    </p>
    <p>After that, Kei just kept giving Ishizaki resentful glances until she left the place.
    </p>
    <p>Their relationship, which seemed to have improved a bit, may be back to square one.
    </p>
    <p>After finishing our reconnaissance while genuinely enjoying a few of the activities, I returned
        with Kei to the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>Students were present in large numbers in the classroom and appeared to love conversing with
        the maids in any way they desired.
    </p>
    <p>When one of the students occasionally deviated from the moral line and persistently called out
        to them, Sudo intervened, forcibly interrupted them, and asked them to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>He suited the role of a bodyguard and was in charge of dealing with trouble.
    </p>
    <p>The two-hour festival simulation would soon be over.
    </p>
    <p>I discussed with Horikita whether or not we needed to make any changes to the final staffing for
        tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>As I, Sudo, and the other boys started cleaning up, Onodera showed up.
    </p>
    <p>"We're done here, too," Onodera said.
    </p>
    <p>"I wish I could have seen everyone's maid outfits."
    </p>
    <p>Onodera, who had been sent out to the outdoor stalls, made a disappointed sound as soon as
        she returned.
    </p>
    <p>"You wanted to see the maids?"
    </p>
    <p>"I like cute things too. Besides, I'm not the kind of person who looks good in a maid's uniform,
    </p>
    <p>my legs are too thick."
    </p>
    <p>"You don't know if it looks good on you or not until you try it on."
    </p>
    <p>"With the limited clothes we have, I'm sure they won't even fit my size."
    </p>
    <p>Onodera then replied with a wry smile, saying that it was impossible for her.
    </p>
    <p>Onodera has a well-trained figure, with broad shoulders and more developed legs than most
        females, as a result of her dedication to swimming.
    </p>
    <p>A custom-sized maid uniform would unavoidably be created specifically for Onodera if we gave
        it to her.
    </p>
    <p>Sudo squatted and shifted his focus to Onodera's thighs.
    </p>
    <p>"Wait, hey Sudo-kun!"
    </p>
    <p>"They're the legs of a well-trained athlete. Well, it's certainly a little different from what you'd call
        a maid."
    </p>
    <p>He placed his finger to his chin and said exactly what he thought.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm so embarrassed!" Onodera blushed and ran out of the classroom like a rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>"What's with her?"
    </p>
    <p>I could sense the clear change in Onodera up close as I observed the two of them interacting. In
        addition to sharing similarities, the two of them were also incredibly close.
    </p>
    <p>Sudo didn't appear to be aware of this, presumably because he had never previously expressed
        affection to Onodera or because he had never even felt the presence of it.
    </p>
    <p>The arrows should have been facing each other, but they were currently pointing in different
        directions. I don't know much about love, but I do know that the fundamental rule in these
        circumstances was to maintain a warm eye on the parties concerned.
    </p>
    <p>But it was the reason my curiosity and desire to observe the outcome of a different pattern
        overcame me. Will they still be able to be a couple if I break the "rules"?
    </p>
    <p>"Don't you understand? Why Onodera behaved like that? The same feelings you have for
        Horikita, Onodera has for you."
    </p>
    <p>"What?"
    </p>
    <p>I said it in a slightly roundabout way, so Sudo didn't immediately understand. However, Sudo
        wasn't so rock-headed that he couldn't understand what I was saying at all.
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? Onodera… me?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah."
    </p>
    <p>"No, no, that couldn’t be it."
    </p>
    <p>He seemed to have thought about it seriously, but denied that it could be true.
    </p>
    <p>This was also a natural reaction.
    </p>
    <p>"Although Onodera may not have been initially drawn to you, you have recently displayed
        remarkably rapid development. It wouldn't be surprising if she became aware of you as a
        member of the opposite sex, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Little by little, Sudo's face turned grim as he began to reorganize his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>"What the hell... why me?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course, there’s no guarantee. If you want to know the truth, it might be important to observe
        Onodera carefully and try to understand her."
    </p>
    <p>"But, hey... I..."
    </p>
    <p>Nothing else needed to be said to understand the situation. Right now, Sudo's feelings were
        strongly directed toward Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>That was why I wanted him to show me how he’ll change from this unnecessary comment of
        mine.
    </p>
    <p>Will he move closer to Horikita or sway toward Onodera?
    </p>
    <p>Or will he change into an unexpected third party?
    </p>
    <p>"No. I'm getting a little confused, I'm going to go cool off while I go see the food stalls."
    </p>
    <p>You'll have to think long and hard to come up with an answer.
    </p>
    <p>"Kiyotaka-kun, was that… okay?"
    </p>
    <p>Yosuke, who was standing by, seemed to have heard my conversation.
    </p>
    <p>"I don’t think you should have interfered."
    </p>
    <p>"Is that so? Well, I’m sorry if that was careless of me. I’m still learning how this works."
    </p>
    <p>I apologized to Yosuke with a blank expression on my face.
    </p>
    <p>A little while later, it was time for the preliminaries to end.
    </p>
    <p>"Good work, everyone. That's all for today. If there are any reassignments for tomorrow's show,
    </p>
    <p>I'll call you from my cell phone by 9 pm."
    </p>
    <p>After all the cleanup was done, all preparations for tomorrow were complete.
    </p>
    <p>The students were already on their way home for tomorrow's performance.
    </p>
    <p>Only two people remained in the classroom, me and Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>"I've been thinking about it a lot, but it just doesn't feel right for you to be a maid," I said.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't want to do it, but it would be nice to have more hands, wouldn't it? It would have been a
        little easier if your girlfriend had cooperated."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but it's out of my jurisdiction. I've left it to Kei's will."
    </p>
    <p>It seemed that Sato and the others, including me, had approached Kei, but she refused to wear
        the maid's uniform.
    </p>
    <p>I haven't heard what the reason was, but I guess it was because she didn't want to change
        clothes rather than because it was too much trouble or because she wasn't suited for customer
        service.
    </p>
    <p>Not everyone understood Kei's body and her past.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm just kidding. It's not something you force anyone to wear. If you're unwilling to wear it, it
        won't make you look good to tomorrow's guests."
    </p>
    <p>"Here, look through this. I've made some adjustments based on today's rehearsal."
    </p>
    <p>I handed the notebook to Horikita for a final check.
    </p>
    <p>"Thank you. It looks like the schedule you've put together is going to be fine."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita looked up from her notebook, "All festival participants are required to take a one-hour
        break before the end of the festival after notifying their homeroom teacher."
    </p>
    <p>They are not allowed to help with any of the stalls during this break and are required to manage
        their staff, whether or not they are busy.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        A boy and a girl were standing face to face in the centre of the street leading to Keyaki Mall.
    </p>
    <p>There were no students in the area at all because the festival's preparatory preparations had
        already started.
    </p>
    <p>"We can finally talk, Yagami-kun."
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't think you would barge in on us while we were preparing for the festival."
    </p>
    <p>"I wouldn't have caught you otherwise. It seemed as if you were avoiding me."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami refused to confront the problem right away even after making contact, forcing Kushida
        to move to this location.
    </p>
    <p>"We just didn't run into each other by coincidence. By the way, it appears that you frequently
        visited my room. I apologise; I was absent."
    </p>
    <p>Both parties kept smiling during the conversation. The scene would seem to be one of friendly
        chit chat if someone were to see the two of them from the sidelines.
    </p>
    <p>"Were you really away? Or were you using the answering machine to harass me?"
    </p>
    <p>"Staying away? Why would I do that? There seems to be some kind of misunderstanding."
    </p>
    <p>"There’s no misunderstanding."
    </p>
    <p>Irritated by Yagami's refusal to let her grasp the reality of the situation, Kushida stepped forward
        on her own.
    </p>
    <p>"You cut me off because I was useless. That's all, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>In the unanimous special exam, Yagami expected Kushida to expel Horikita and Ayanokoji.
    </p>
    <p>Since she failed to live up to that expectation, and since there was no contact between them, it
        wasn’t surprising for Kushida to judge as such.
    </p>
    <p>"Do you remember that I contacted you on the night of the unanimous special exam?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. Of course, I remember."
    </p>
    <p>On the night the exam ended, Yagami called and learned from Kushida's mouth that Horikita
        and Ayanokoji had not dropped out.
    </p>
    <p>The call was cut off shortly after that, and Kushida has not been able to reach Yagami since.
    </p>
    <p>"I will be honest with you. I thought Kushida-senpai hated me. That's why I haven't had the
        courage to face you lately, and maybe I've been unconsciously avoiding you."
    </p>
    <p>"Stop it. It's no use lying to me like that now. Pretending to be a junior who has a liking for me
        only gives me the chills after I learned part of your true nature."
    </p>
    <p>"Excuse me. Now, could you tell me again how that day happened?"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida was beginning to understand.
    </p>
    <p>The freshman in front of her was just having fun playing with her. He knew all about the
        unanimous special exam, and he was about to open his playful hands again.
    </p>
    <p>"I won't answer."
    </p>
    <p>"Why not? At least we know that Kushida-senpai acted to expel one of those two students. But
        as a result, Sakura-senpai was expelled instead of Kushidasenpai. What I want to know are the
        details of it."
    </p>
    <p>"I did nothing in that special exam. So, Sakura-san, who was the lowest in OAA, was inevitably
        cut. That's it."
    </p>
    <p>The class details in the unanimous special exam were not leaked to outsiders. So, Yagami
        wanted to know the details.
    </p>
    <p>She attempted to exclude the narrative by implying that Sakura Airi was only chosen because of
        a lack of talent. However, Yagami didn't stop grinning and gently placed his hand on Kushida's
        shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>"You shouldn't lie."
    </p>
    <p>"Lie?"
    </p>
    <p>"Kushida-senpai’s behavioural pattern has substantially changed since the unanimity special
        exam. Although you seemed to be getting along with students in other classes as usual, I have
        previously looked into this and understand that you have cut off contact with your classmates. In
        other words, your true personality was somewhat revealed by that unanimous special exam."
    </p>
    <p>Externally, Kushida had been smiling at her classmates. But there were limits since her
        classmates were more distant than ever.
    </p>
    <p>A small group of girls used to hang out a couple of times a week, but now it's down to zero.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm still getting along with my classmates as usual."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida implied that Yagami just so happened to miss the times she was hanging out with her
        classmates.
    </p>
    <p>Kushida tried to push it that way, but Yagami kept smiling.
    </p>
    <p>"It's no use trying to hide it; Kushida-senpai allowed her class to discover all about her past. And
        it was definitely Ayanokōji-senpai who pushed her into that corner."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami spoke eloquently, as if he had been watching Kushida and the others fight in class. The
        fact that he mentioned Ayanokouji instead of Horikita's name was clearly unusual.
    </p>
    <p>"You're imagining things on your own. It doesn't fit at all."
    </p>
    <p>"You're free to misrepresent it, but... What on earth do you want from me if you have nothing to
        say? I have to help with the festival, so I'd like to get back as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm tired of hanging out with you, Yagami-kun."
    </p>
    <p>"You’re tired of...?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm tired of being your friend, Yagami-kun. That's all I wanted to say today."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida abruptly offered to end her relationship with Yagami.
    </p>
    <p>"You want to end your relationship with me. I understand that feeling. Since Kushida-senpai's
        past and character are now known in the class, there is no point in pressing Horikita-senpai or
        Ayanokoji-senpai to be expelled now."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not going to correct every single thing anymore. If you want to interpret it as you see fit, go
        ahead."
    </p>
    <p>"You're an interesting person, Kushida-senpai. What you just said was the truth. Besides,
    </p>
    <p>Kushida-senpai herself is beginning to think that it's okay to throw herself into this environment.
    </p>
    <p>So, she wants to end her backwards relationship with me and look forward."
    </p>
    <p>She wanted to look forward. Those words stuck in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>"Aside from Ayanokoji-senpai, have you made peace with Horikita-senpai?"
    </p>
    <p>"I won't answer that either."
    </p>
    <p>"By the looks of it, you've been heartbroken. I'm a little disappointed, Kushida-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida resisted the urge to retort, but anger welled up within her, and she continued hating
        Horikita as much as ever.
    </p>
    <p>"I am…!"
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, that's okay. You don't have to say anything else. I can tell by looking at you."
    </p>
    <p>His dismissive attitude lacked some of his former politeness.
    </p>
    <p>Kushida couldn't help but be a little unnerved by this, but she couldn't risk appearing weak in
        this situation.
    </p>
    <p>Instead, she stood out as being more tolerant than the ordinary student, possibly as a result of
        her frequent interactions with unusual characters like Ayanokoji, Ryuen, or Amasawa.
    </p>
    <p>She was surprised and felt a sense of realization when acting tough.
    </p>
    <p>"This is the end of us, Yagami-kun. We have nothing to do with each other, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Rest assured. You're worried that I might go around exposing Kushidasenpai's past, right?
    </p>
    <p>That's why you came to check on me while giving me a warning, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's right, if Yagami-kun exposes me, rumors about me will go around the school."
    </p>
    <p>"Then will you listen to what I have to say?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'll tell them everything about Yagami-kun, about how you used me to get Ayanokōji and
        Horikita expelled from school, about how you’re a devil with a kind face."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami didn't know if this was a threat. Still, using the weapons she has now is the only way
        Kushida can defend herself.
    </p>
    <p>"You have threatened back. Then I will keep that in mind. Are we done?" Whether it works or
        not, Yagami broke off the conversation and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm the leader of the 1st year Class B. I'm busy with various cultural festival stalls, so I'll see you
        then."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't forget, Yagami-kun, that as long as you keep your promise, I will keep mine."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami smiled at last and disappeared out of sight with light steps.
    </p>
    <p>"I hope this is the end of it."
    </p>
    <p>While she held such wistful thinking, she also realized that it wasn't the end.
    </p>
    <p>So what should she do?
    </p>
    <p>Should she prepare to attack or should she just stand there and wait with her finger on her
        mouth?
    </p>
    <p>"No. I can't stop Yagami..."
    </p>
    <p>Up until now, Kushida had challenged and lost to various opponents, including Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>She now realized that she was painfully alone.
    </p>
    <p>She realize that she is alone. But even so, the situation has changed drastically.
    </p>
    <p>The other person is certainly holding Kushida in low esteem. Not only at the outside but, also
        from their heart.
    </p>
    <p>Even so, she prided herself on being able to read such things.
    </p>
    <p>"Before I fight that guy, I have something to do."
    </p>
    <p>She was aware that the issue goes beyond Yagami alone and needs to be resolved.
    </p>
    <p>She had no desire to revert to her previous role as a kind honour student, but in order to keep
        her place in the class, she needed to make a significant contribution.
    </p>
    <p>Kushida Kikyo knew how to survive by herself.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 5</h3>
<p>
In the middle of the night, I received a phone call.
</p><p>"It's very unusual for you to call me, Sakayanagi."
</p><p>On the other end of the line, Sakayanagi let out a little chuckle.
</p><p>"Indeed you may be right. May I have a few minutes of your time now?"
</p><p>"I wouldn't be answering if it wasn't convenient."
</p><p>"I see. Then let’s get straight to the point, Ayanokoji-kun, you will naturally participate in the
cultural festival, right? My father seems to be concerned that there may be people from the
outside who will come to bring you back."
</p><p>"The chairman of the board called me a little while ago. He told me that I should consider taking
this time off from the main event again, but I politely declined."
</p><p>I probably would have attended the last sports festival if not for the fact that it was to give
Sakayanagi a break.
</p><p>"Aren't you afraid? No, that's a foolish question, I'll change the question a bit. Are you perhaps
assuming that the people involved will not move to recapture you?"
</p><p>Otherwise, Sakayanagi said, she doesn't see the point of me purposefully putting myself in
harm's way.
</p><p>"It's simply a question between actual harm and potential harm. If everything is settled with the
sports festival and cultural festival, then sure it would be nice to rest, but there’s also a school
trip coming. There’s no guarantee that next year’s sports festival and cultural festival will be
without spectators. It’s easy to stay in your comfort zone, but the opportunities I will lose by
doing so are far more troublesome."
</p><p>"So you want to experience your remaining school life and what is normal for a student as much
as possible."
</p><p>She replied in agreement with my way of thinking.
</p><p>"Besides, I have other objectives. I don't want to waste them."
</p><p>"If that's the case, I have nothing further to say; I think it's best that Ayanokoji-kun does what he
wants."
</p><p>Although I was interested in the festival, I realised it was inappropriate to inquire about it. Was
her goal to simply win the showcase or to completely dominate the opposition? Does she have
another objective in mind? She might respond if I questioned her, but that would bring up a new
topic.
</p><p>It was up to Class A to make whatever choice they make, and no third party had the right to
decide what was right or wrong.
</p><p>"Unexpected events, however, are things that can occur at any time. Even if the festival is
secure, anything could happen at any moment. Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me if
you need help at any moment."
</p><p>"That's very kind of you."
</p><p>"I can't have Ayanokoji-kun disappear before we have a rematch."
</p><p>"I'll take care of myself."
</p><p>"I'll see you soon then. Good night."
</p><p>Avoiding any idle chatter, Sakayanagi ended the call with a mutter.
</p><p></p>
