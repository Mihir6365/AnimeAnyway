    <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
    <h2>The Cultural Festival</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        After a long period of preparation, the day of the cultural festival finally arrived.
    </p>
    <p>Students are expected to arrive at school by 8:30 a.m. as the start time is 9:00 a.m.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the gates to the school open at 6:00 a.m., allowing students to prepare early in the
        morning if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>In the very early morning, at 6:00 a.m., Horikita and I met in the lobby of the dormitory to go to
        school.
    </p>
    <p>This is because we wanted to make the final checks in advance so that there should be no
        inconvenience to the production during the festival.
    </p>
    <p>She looked at the box I was holding in my hands as soon as I joined her.
    </p>
    <p>"Good morning. Is that the box you were talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry you had to come up with a budget you didn't plan for."
    </p>
    <p>"It wasn't a huge amount, so the impact was minimal. Originally, Each of us in 2nd year were
        given 5,000 points, which we should have been able to spend freely."
    </p>
    <p>We also bump across students who arrive early with the same idea from the first to the third
        year, though there aren't as many of them.
    </p>
    <p>I stopped by the classroom once, placed down the box there, and then came to the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>"Did you get the call from Matsushita-san?"
    </p>
    <p>"I did. It must be hard for her, since she was one of the driving forces behind the maid cafes up
        to this point."
    </p>
    <p>Early in the morning, Matsushita called to report that she had to take the day off due to illness.
    </p>
    <p>"But it's a good decision."
    </p>
    <p>If she had only a slight fever, she might have been able to go, but she had developed a cough
        and other symptoms, so she could not be trusted with a job that required customer service.
    </p>
    <p>However, even if she was reassigned, Matsushita, who is in poor health, cannot be entrusted
        with a heavy workload, and the spread of a cold would affect the class after the festival.
    </p>
    <p>"Besides, this is the kind of preparation we need to make in advance."
    </p>
    <p>Simply reassigning staff is insufficient; you also need to know where to add in the necessary
        personnel.
    </p>
    <p>"Speaking of which, did you hear? It's rumored that Hasebe-san and Miyake-kun may have
        been the ones who leaked the information about the maid cafe."
    </p>
    <p>"Sounds like it. But we could have foreseen that at an early stage, couldn't we?"
    </p>
    <p>This information came down from Kei, who was in close contact with the girls and had already
        heard about it.
    </p>
    <p>"I guess so. But I wonder if it was really a good idea to leave it alone."
    </p>
    <p>"Rumors are rumors. Haruka and Akito didn't actually leak the information."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita's self-loathing at not being able to help Haruka and the others peeked out.
    </p>
    <p>"You shouldn't show your weakness so easily. It will only give them an opening to take
        advantage of you."
    </p>
    <p>"You’re always so calm as if you’re a stranger to the situation."
    </p>
    <p>I noticed that Horikita was looking at me as if to check my expression.
    </p>
    <p>The observation continued for five or ten seconds, and then I noticed that her face had changed
        to a difficult expression with a wrinkle between her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>"I have a few questions…do you usually interact with the first-year students?"
    </p>
    <p>"First-year students? No, I don't. I talk to Nanase or Amasawa once in a while, but that's about
        it."
    </p>
    <p>I feel like I shouldn't say that I interact with them, since I rarely ever go see them myself.
    </p>
    <p>"Is that what you wanted to ask?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's not a big deal."
    </p>
    <p>"Speaking of interaction, what about you? You talk to first years in the student council, don't
        you?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I do. I'm getting a little bit more involved with the juniors."
    </p>
    <p>The student council had gained three people from this year's first years; the second years only
        had Ichinose for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>There was a distinct lack of quality, if not quantity, of talent.
    </p>
    <p>The most recent addition was Horikita, but it was likely that the number of members were
        adjusted to fill the gap.
    </p>
    <p>The student council could have as many members as it wanted, but it was stated that eight to
        twelve members were usually there.
    </p>
    <p>At this school, there are currently three third-year students, two second-year students, and three
        first-year students.
    </p>
    <p>It would seem that they were following past conventions.
    </p>
    <p>"At first, I thought it was useless. I would rather be in my room studying than doing student
        council work because it would better benefit me. To be honest, that feeling hasn't gone away."
    </p>
    <p>Student council work wasn't the only thing that seemed like such a waste of time. Whether it
        was club activities or friendships, it was basically a series of futility.
    </p>
    <p>Some may go from club activities to becoming professionals, or from friendships to future jobs,
    </p>
    <p>but for many, these will be nothing more than memories of the past.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, if you work hard at your studies, it is likely to lead you to a great future.
    </p>
    <p>It would be the most solid and safe choice a student could make.
    </p>
    <p>"There’s a lot to be learned in futility. You're beginning to see that."
    </p>
    <p>"Your brother was student council president, too."
    </p>
    <p>"My brother's case is different from mine. He was able to carry out his student council duties
        flawlessly while also achieving impeccable results in his schoolwork. I don't think he ever felt
        that the student council was a burden, nor did he suffer from a lack of studying."
    </p>
    <p>Even if we'll never know the actual truth, there was always plenty of room for Horikita to study. I
        don't think there was any way she didn't put in a lot of bloody effort, but she didn't let it show in
        vain.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm grateful to you, if only for the results. Joining the student council has helped me see things I
        couldn't see."
    </p>
    <p>She was honestly thankful, or so I thought, but she still went on with her words.
    </p>
    <p>"It made me realize how great my brother is again, and I have to do a lot of extra work."
    </p>
    <p>"I wish you had just been honest and thanked me."
    </p>
    <p>"You have to accept some complaints."
    </p>
    <p>"I agree and sympathize with you that academics are a difficult goal for you."
    </p>
    <p>I am sure that I am not inferior to Manabu when it comes to pure academic and physical ability
        alone.
    </p>
    <p>But if he was in the same grade under the rules of this school.
    </p>
    <p>It's an unlikely story, but you never know what kind of fight it would have been.
    </p>
    <p>If I'm right, he had that kind of power and influence to get me to think seriously
    </p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        As 9:00 a.m arrived at the maid cafe in the special wing of the school, an announcement was
        made to all students at once.
    </p>
    <p>Guests stepped through the main gate and the opening of the festival was announced.
    </p>
    <p>"What do I do, I'm getting nervous..."
    </p>
    <p>"I haven't had any contact with outsiders since I entered this school."
    </p>
    <p>I heard a conversation with Ike, who was standing shoulder to shoulder with Shinohara.
    </p>
    <p>I guess being in a closed environment for so long certainly created extra tension.
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Sato and the other maids continued to discuss the shift change due to Matsushita's
        absence.
    </p>
    <p>Although the burden on each of them would inevitably increase, the time adjustment was
        nearing completion.
    </p>
    <p>Sato, dressed in her maid costume, clasped her hands together in anxiety, but quickly slapped
        her own cheeks between her palms to regain confidence.
    </p>
    <p>"We can do it, we can do it!"
    </p>
    <p>"Maya-chan will be fine. I'll back you up too."
    </p>
    <p>Kei, who was helping behind the scenes, cheerfully encouraged her.
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, I'll do my best!"
    </p>
    <p>Since overcoming a big hurdle, the two of them have really grown closer.
    </p>
    <p>Their relationship as best friends won’t be broken in the slightest from now on.
    </p>
    <p>The only other member I had to worry about was...
    </p>
    <p>I looked around and observed the other students.
    </p>
    <p>Sudo and some of the male team members were not listening to the announcements and were
        having their final meeting with Yosuke.
    </p>
    <p>We had to keep our feet on the ground about what to do when it gets crowded or in case of
        trouble.
    </p>
    <p>After giving out all the instructions, we realized that we were short two students. Immediately
        after, Horikata and I looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>We must’ve been thinking the same thing. She approached and spoke to me in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>"Hasebe-san and Miyake-kun seem to be missing."
    </p>
    <p>"I guess it's not like they're in the restroom."
    </p>
    <p>The other students seemed to be too busy minding their own business to have noticed yet.
    </p>
    <p>"I knew there was something going on at this festival, but ……"
    </p>
    <p>"If it's just simply slacking off, I guess I'm rather grateful."
    </p>
    <p>For Horikita, who had not calculated them as a force to be reckoned with from the start, there
        was no need to get worked up if they just didn’t help out.
    </p>
    <p>However, if they were to sabotage the project, that would be a different story.
    </p>
    <p>"But it also adds fuel to the fire because of the rumors."
    </p>
    <p>"If you leak information and then skip the festival, well, that's enough blame, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>"I've been keeping an eye on it so far, thinking only time will tell, but …… I still think we should
        do something about it early on. We should at least dispel the rumors."
    </p>
    <p>"I understand what you're saying, but we should focus on the festival today."
    </p>
    <p>"Is that what you want?"
    </p>
    <p>"Even if we can erase the rumors, we can't erase the fact that those two have slipped out.
    </p>
    <p>Besides, there is still a possibility that they could embarrass the class in some other way at the
        festival."
    </p>
    <p>With multiple sources of anxiety, a poor response could lead to unnecessary animosity.
    </p>
    <p>Taking sides is certainly only for when Haruka and Miyake are determined to not be the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>"I agree."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita was a bit nervous, but she cleared her throat to get rid of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sure you'll be able to handle Hasebe-san and Miyake-kun just fine."
    </p>
    <p>I replied with a glance, and decided to start greeting the guests.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        "Welcome!"
    </p>
    <p>Sato's cheerful voice echoed in the classroom, or rather the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, the first guest to enter the store was a man who appeared to be in his 40s.
    </p>
    <p>A total of six maids waiting in the store responded all at once as they had been trained to do.
    </p>
    <p>"Let me show you to your seat."
    </p>
    <p>Sato's voice was cheerful, but her movements were stiff, since she wasn’t entirely comfortable
        yet.
    </p>
    <p>Still, thanks to the rehearsal the day before, there were no major mistakes, and after showing
        the guest to their seat, she took the menu list and cold drinks to his table.
    </p>
    <p>The only way to get back to the practiced routine was to repeat the process and let them get
        used to the guests.
    </p>
    <p>Then, slowly but surely, the number of guests began to increase.
    </p>
    <p>The age range was similar, but sometimes teenage boys and girls who appeared to be the
        guests’ family members began to shyly walk in.
    </p>
    <p>"A good start, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>It wasn't suddenly full, but it was nice to see that the seats weren't all empty.
    </p>
    <p>My cell phone was constantly receiving calls and reports from my classmates scattered around
        the school.
    </p>
    <p>Which exhibits were attracting the most people and which were deserted.
    </p>
    <p>Since the sales of each class were unknown until the end of the festival, we had no choice but
        to gather information personally.
    </p>
    <p>Fortunately, all students were required to take a one-hour break, so there were always a certain
        number of students who were not busy.
    </p>
    <p>That is why, of course, our class was always being scouted as well.
    </p>
    <p>After watching the room for a while, I decided to take a look at the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>It seemed that many guests had already made their way to the special wing, and as far as I
        could see, the guests outnumbered the students.
    </p>
    <p>If that man was behind this, it's possible that he's already here.
    </p>
    <p>I don't think he would be looking for me on the day of the event without having done his
        homework, leaving no stone unturned. But so far, I haven't seen anyone suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>Besides, with so many adults, students, and children in the area, it would not be easy to make
        contact with me.
    </p>
    <p>For now, the focus should be on the current students rather than on them. Yoshida from
        Sakayanagi’s class was peeking into the maid cafe without trying to hide.
    </p>
    <p>There was no sign of student’s from Class C at the moment, but they would likely come to check
        the situation at some point soon.
    </p>
    <p>The classroom door opened vigorously, and Ike and Hondo came out in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>"We took the order as fast as possible! I'm going to the food stall to get it now!"
    </p>
    <p>"That's fine, but please be a little more calm."
    </p>
    <p>Some of the guests were surprised by what happened.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, right. Sorry!"
    </p>
    <p>It was not an ideal situation for customers or potential customers to watch a flurry of restaurant
        personnel run to get their food. With a warning, the two looked at each other, nodded, and
        began to move, albeit at a rather fast pace.
    </p>
    <p>With this being the first delivery, we couldn’t afford to be late.
    </p>
    <p>Today, this kind of back-and-forth repeated itself every time an order was placed.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji."
    </p>
    <p>I turned around when my name was called and saw Kanzaki approaching me.
    </p>
    <p>"Looks like you're already thriving."
    </p>
    <p>We had gone through the preliminary phases, but Ichinose's class's offering was, as I recall,
    </p>
    <p>sweets-based.
    </p>
    <p>They dealt things like crepes and chocolate bananas.
    </p>
    <p>"What about you?"
    </p>
    <p>"The kids love them. But the adults are not as receptive as we thought they would be, so we're
        not sure if we can aim for the top spot in terms of sales."
    </p>
    <p>"You may have a hard time, then."
    </p>
    <p>"Probably, but my priorities have shifted so I’m not entirely concerned about this festival at the
        moment."
    </p>
    <p>Apparently, the first step towards change with Himeno may have worked.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to the gym now. I want to learn what I can from the third year for the future."
    </p>
    <p>"I see. See you later."
    </p>
    <p>After seeing Kanzaki's walk off, I decided to return to the maid cafe and start working.
    </p>
    <p>I didn’t have much to do until "noon" arrived, though.
    </p>
    <p>In a small partitioned off corner of the classroom, I stood by to deal with any problems that could
        arise.
    </p>
    <p>I’m also in charge of taking pictures of guests who want to have their picture taken.
    </p>
    <p>After the first photo shoot, the guests who had been watching quickly started wanting to be
        photographed one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>I'm not saying that there weren’t adults out there who would like to make some fun memories
        with high school students, but it was better to assume that the guests were taking advantage of
        the festival’s purpose and dropping money on us.
    </p>
    <p>In a sense, it seemed that quite a few of them decided that this was also their job.
    </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, conversation and laughter gradually spread throughout the maid cafe, and it
        began to show aspects of a lively, ubiquitous cafe.
    </p>
    <p>"New customers, please show them around."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita's inorganic voice reached the classroom filled with laughter. Sato immediately
        approached to serve the customer and began to lead him to an empty seat.
    </p>
    <p>"Sato-san will show you around. "
    </p>
    <p>"Well then, if you’ll follow me...."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, who is not very good at showing affection, was in charge of outdoor advertising.
    </p>
    <p>She did not smile in person, despite the fact that she was dressed as a maid to draw attention
        from customers.
    </p>
    <p>If this were a real maid cafe, Horikita would have been fired during her training period after
        passing her interview.
    </p>
    <p>However, the idea of Horikita giving an interview at a maid cafe is totally unlikely.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        Within the first two hours of the event, the maid cafe was continuing to draw in customers as
        expected.
    </p>
    <p>The important thing is how much we can sell the purchased products.
    </p>
    <p>Especially because the film we bought in large quantities costs about 70 points per sheet.
    </p>
    <p>So far it seems to be going on nicely, and I, the photographer and the instant camera, have
        been busy flying around the classroom!
    </p>
    <p>The instant camera, which cost nearly 9,000 points, was not a cheap photographic equipment to
        have invested in, and I had to buy another one in case my current one broke down.
    </p>
    <p>"I got one shot~!"
    </p>
    <p>The maids' voices echo through the store, and I move out of the waiting room, camera in hand.
    </p>
    <p>It seems that this time they wanted a photo shoot with Mii-chan, and Ichihashi, who was in
        charge of the bill, promptly received the points on her cell phone and completed the payment.
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, cheese!"
    </p>
    <p>After taking a two-shot of the laughing Mi-chan and the customer, I checked the film that popped
        out of the instant camera.
    </p>
    <p>"As I thought..."
    </p>
    <p>Although I was suspicious at the moment of shooting, I had released the shutter at the moment
        Mi-chan closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>"Ugh, sorry Ayanokoji-kun……"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry about it. I'll take another picture."
    </p>
    <p>It's a souvenir piece, I don't mind if there are some problems with the guest's expression, but I
        cannot give them one with a mistake in the maid's expression.
    </p>
    <p>This was not only a consideration for the guests, but also for the maids, such as Mii-chan.
    </p>
    <p>As a girl, there was no way she would accept a badly taken photo.
    </p>
    <p>That was why, even though each picture could be taken for 800 points, two, or in some cases
        three, sheets of film were needed.
    </p>
    <p>The second shoot went well, so I handed over the photos that were ready to be developed. After
        the shooting was over, I quickly went back to the waiting room.
    </p>
    <p>Well, I've been repeating this endlessly since morning.
    </p>
    <p>But still…
        This cultural festival, which has many political figures, is a great opportunity for that man.
    </p>
    <p>I knew that even if there were many people around me, he would take some measures to set
        me up.
    </p>
    <p>This must have been the same for Chairman Sakayanagi.
    </p>
    <p>However, as noon approached, there was no sign of any change taking place.
    </p>
    <p>Tsukishiro, and the mysterious student who visited him at the Sports festival, I remember
        Conversation that I had with both of them..
    </p>
    <p>"But no matter how good you are, you are still just a child. You should understand that that
        person has already factored in that strength of yours and sent me to you."
    </p>
    <p>"After eliminating Tsukishiro, all we have to do is eliminate the white room students and peace
        will return. I came here to advise you because I think you are making such a mistake."
    </p>
    <p>If we were to tie these matters together somewhat forcefully, it would be natural to think of
        capturing me by force with adults who are not students through the cultural festival.
    </p>
    <p>In fact, they decided to use Tsukishiro to forcefully hold the festival, so it should be so. Would
        they miss this great opportunity by letting me evade them?
    </p>
    <p>No, the issue still hasn't yet come to light.
    </p>
    <p>Missing an opportunity. Of course, the festival is not over yet.
    </p>
    <p>But what if they didn't come here at all?
    </p>
    <p>That would not be mere negligence, but….
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun, what should I do, I seem to have run out of Darjeeling!"
    </p>
    <p>Seeing Mii-chan rushing in with a panicked look on her face, I interrupted my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>Let's focus on the problem at hand for now.
    </p>
    <p>We had prepared several kinds of tea, but the Darjeeling, which used high end tea leaves, sold
        out immediately.
    </p>
    <p>We discussed and narrowed down our stocking to a minimum number because it is a high price
        range product costing 1,200 points, but it is selling unexpectedly well.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, inexpensive tea bags sold poorly. Since it was impossible to buy more on the
        day of the show, we could not restore our inventory now.
    </p>
    <p>"Put a Sold out sticker on all the menu boards right away. I'll handwrite corrections on the signs
        that are posted outside."
    </p>
    <p>"Uh-huh."
    </p>
    <p>I grabbed a pen and immediately corrected the sign with the menu at the entrance of the
        restaurant. Both were cheap props from the bargain bin, but they would work.
    </p>
    <p>"That should work."
    </p>
    <p>I highlighted the "Sold out by popular demand" written next to Darjeeling. Although this is a
        biased sellout, this will also serve as a form of promotion for the popularity of maid cafes.
    </p>
    <p>Immediately after, an arm extended from behind me on the left side.
    </p>
    <p>What came into view was not a school uniform, but the fabric of a suit.
    </p>
    <p>"Take this without turning around."
    </p>
    <p>The white paper, folded in two, swayed in the slight breeze coming in through the window.
    </p>
    <p>There may be no contact, and just when I thought so, this is it.
    </p>
    <p>It would be easy to ignore the order not to turn around, but I took it silently.
    </p>
    <p>The person who approached me at such a short distance without giving me any sign of him was
        not an ordinary person.
    </p>
    <p>"May I ask your name?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's needless prying."
    </p>
    <p>As soon as I grab the paper, his left arm disappears from my sight. I held that position for a
        while, and then I sensed another presence approaching.
    </p>
    <p>"What's wrong, Kiyotaka-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>Yousuke seems to have come out of the classroom, concerned that I didn't come back right
        away.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, I was approached by a guest who got a little lost and had to be dealt with. Any trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>"Orders are starting to not turn out well. The stalls seem to be doing better than expected."
    </p>
    <p>"I see, the turnover is getting out of control. I'll be right there."
    </p>
    <p>After confirming that Yosuke had left, I unfolded the paper I had been holding in my right hand.
    </p>
    <p>[I'm here to pick you up. Decide for yourself what to do. I'll wait for you at the front gate.]
        He even politely included his phone number.
    </p>
    <p>I decide what to do? If they are really giving me a choice, did they really think I would choose to
        leave?
    </p>
    <p>It was unclear how much significance the note had.
    </p>
    <p>All I could say for sure was that the person who handed this to me was connected to the White
        Room.
    </p>
    <p>Have they decided that they can't use direct force and will leave it to my judgement?
    </p>
    <p>But the fact that no steps had been taken so far may have something to do with that sentence.
    </p>
    <p>Either way, there was no point in worrying about it. I rolled up the small piece of paper, put it in
        my mouth, and swallowed it.
    </p>
    <p>Paper originally comes from plants, and its main component is cellulose.
    </p>
    <p>Since humans don't have any enzymes to break it down, it cannot be digested and is excreted
        as it is.
    </p>
    <p>It is not a problem if a third party picks up this note, but carelessly keeping it in your possession
        could lead to some demerits.
    </p>
    <p>If it's a cultural festival where it'shardtomovefromplacetoplace, it's easier to do this quickly because there
        are no additional issues.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        It's been 3 hours since the Cultural festival started.
    </p>
    <p>Around noon, new guests were arriving to replace the families who came to school first thing in
        the morning. After receiving a report from Ike and the others who had gone out to scout the
        area, I went near the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>"Over there!"
    </p>
    <p>Ike pointed to where several girls from Ryuen’s class were shouting.
    </p>
    <p>"We, the 2nd year C class, are now competing with the 2nd year B class for sales at the concept
        cafe! If we lose, someone could be held responsible and expelled!"
    </p>
    <p>The atmosphere is clearly different from that of many students who are basically smiling,
    </p>
    <p>cheerful and continue to serve customers.
    </p>
    <p>Many guests stopped to watch the saddened faces and the shouting.
    </p>
    <p>"Please, Everyone Cooperate with us! Thank you very much in advance!"
    </p>
    <p>One after another, they handed out the flyers that seemed to made by them.
    </p>
    <p>I approached a boy of junior high school age who seemed to have received one of them and
        asked him to show it to me briefly.
    </p>
    <p>It describes in detail the offerings of the class that will operate a kimono concept cafe on the
        second floor of the special building, but does not mention any menu or other prices.
    </p>
    <p>Instead, it put the confrontation at the forefront, strongly emphasizing that this was a battle that
        could not be lost.
    </p>
    <p>"What? What? This is bad, right?"
    </p>
    <p>The girls made sincere requests, but it couldn't be said that they were not exaggerating.
    </p>
    <p>It seems that Ryuen is threatening to drop out them from the school.
    </p>
    <p>"Is he seriously trying to get someone expelled, that Ryuen guy?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know. The possibility of that is probably low. Putting aside the forced expulsion with a
        penalty, it would be a problem if the expulsion was carried out without consent. In fact, if the
        threatened students report to the school, not only Ryuen's position gets under risk, but class
        points will also inevitably drop."
    </p>
    <p>"Then it's a lie! Let's go there now and make it stop!"
    </p>
    <p>"Impossible. His classmates strongly fear the chance he’s telling the truth. Besides, if you listen
        to the words out loud, all they've said is that they might be expelled from school."
    </p>
    <p>So there is nothing to determine that they are lying to the guests as well.
    </p>
    <p>The fact that it is not just a mere confrontation is typical of Ryuen, who makes one move after
        another.
    </p>
    <p>It was safe to assume that they were working more towards beating us than to be among the
        top four.
    </p>
    <p>"If we lose, they'll take away 1 million private points, right? Oh no!"
    </p>
    <p>I would love to tell Ike not to worry, but it's important to expose the public to the fact that they are
        seriously frightened. The importance of the confrontation becomes more clear.
    </p>
    <p>"W-What are we going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>"If they want to do this, we'll just fight back with a similar strategy."
    </p>
    <p>"You mean threaten to expel someone too!?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, not that way. We're going to show them that we're also putting all of our effort into the
        concept cafe competition as a second year B class. We are ready for that."
    </p>
    <p>"What? And what do you mean ready?"
    </p>
    <p>"Open the cardboard box I brought for you."
    </p>
    <p>I had Hondo and Tonomura take the box down to the ground and remove the duct tape. Out of it
        came a bunch of flyers.
    </p>
    <p>"This is…! It's a flyer just like theirs!"
    </p>
    <p>"I was also planning to put up flyers to encourage guests to come if necessary. They beat me to
        it, but I think it will work."
    </p>
    <p>The flyers prepared by Horikita and Ryuen’s class were quickly circulated throughout the school,
    </p>
    <p>and word spread that the two classes were competing against each other.
    </p>
    <p>This way, it was also self-evident that they were making big bets on the one on-one match-up.
    </p>
    <p>Knowing about this confrontation will give the illusion that both classes were taking similar risks.
    </p>
    <p>It doesn't create the need for me to go out of my way to threaten my classmates.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to call the girls who have free hands now and ask them to spread the flyers all at
        once."
    </p>
    <p>"Okay, okay! I'll let them know right away!"
    </p>
    <p>The process was to have them use their feet directly and have Hondo and the others
        communicate the information to all classmates.
    </p>
    <p>Then, in addition to the specified locations for handing out fliers, we informed the boys
        managing the stalls that we would also be confronting Ryuen's class.
    </p>
    <p>"Did you hear that Horikita's class and Ryuen's class are playing for a lot of money?"
    </p>
    <p>"I heard that the leader of the losing class is getting expelled?"
    </p>
    <p>It seemed that word of the one-on-one match was beginning to reach the ears of ordinary
        students who had nothing to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>Speculation led to rumors, and rumors led to speculation.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going back. Let me know if anything else comes up."
    </p>
    <p>Ike and the others who delivered meals were always on the lookout for changes in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>They assuredly nodded, so I let them continue while I made my way back to the special wing.
    </p>
    <p>On the way there, I spotted a Japanese-style girl holding a leaflet in a corner of a largely empty
        corridor.
    </p>
    <p>"Sshase!"
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : The girl here uses the word - 'Sshase'「っしゃせー」which like the word 'Shasu' 「しゃ
        す」,used later on, is a godan Verb which means : to thank. It does have other meaning but in
        this situation, it's the character just saying the word to thank people. ]</p>
    <p>
        She periodically distributes pamphlets to passing adults in a manner that reminds me of the
        lethargic individuals I sometimes saw at the Keyaki Mall performing Tisshukubari with no energy
        at all.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : The word ティッシュ配り, Tisshukubari is known as Tissue-pack marketing. In this,
        Instead of flyers and pamphlets you are given a facial tissue pack with the brand's logo and
        promotion material printed on it. Since most people don't take flyers as they are of no use,

        people surely take free tissue packs and end up reading it. Successful advertisement than flyers
        and much more useful. ]</p>
    <p>
        It's just that she's dispassionately handing out the set number of leaflets.
    </p>
    <p>"Can I have one?"
    </p>
    <p>"Shasu."
    </p>
    <p>She may not even be aware of my presence, but she mumbles a small thank you and holds out
        a leaflet to me.
    </p>
    <p>However, when I received it, the other person's eyes saw me.
    </p>
    <p>"Eh."
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't realize you were handing out flyers in a place like this, Ibuki."
    </p>
    <p>"Shut up. Go away."
    </p>
    <p>She looked at me with such a disgusted look on her face that she turned away from me, as if
        she's being looked at by someone who she doesn't want to be looked at.
    </p>
    <p>"I heard about it, but I guess that means you're keeping your word."
    </p>
    <p>I had heard that she would dress in a kimono after losing the match with Ryuen, but it suits her
        better than I expected.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I guess 'fine feathers make a fine bird' huh?"
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here Ayanokoji didn't necessarily used the same phrase. He said - "Magonimoishō
        ka" / 「馬子にも衣装 か」 which is a phrase which simply translates to - "anybody can look good
        with the right clothes" but it could be represented as different phrases in English. I choose this
        Phrase because it looks like what Ayanokoji would say (with his literary knowledge) and unlike
        other phrases, it also looks like the phrase ibuki won't understand. ]
    </p>
    <p>
        She stared at me intensely, but I was relieved that she didn't seem to understand much of what I
        meant.
    </p>
    <p>"It's nothing."
    </p>
    <p>It's not easy to finish distributing all the flyers if you're handing out flyers in an unpopular place.
    </p>
    <p>"Shouldn't you move to another location? I saw Yamashita and others handing out over there."
    </p>
    <p>"You've got to be kidding me. Why should I work with those guys?'
    </p>
    <p>Although I already knew her answer, she immediately rejected me.
    </p>
    <p>"You take all of it from me, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's unreasonable."
    </p>
    <p>"I've had enough. I think I'll just throw them away in a garbage bag..."
    </p>
    <p>She swore as she looked down at the bunch of flyers.
    </p>
    <p>The reason she didn’t do so is probably to make sure she is well punished for her loss to Ryuen.
    </p>
    <p>When you win, you force your opponents to do things, but when you lose, you run away.
    </p>
    <p>If you continue to do that, you won’t be able to compete with Ryuen or any other opponent in the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>"By the way, what did you confront Ryuen with?"
    </p>
    <p>"I would have preferred a one to one battle, but he suggested we play a card game."
    </p>
    <p>"Card game? You mean like poker or something like that?
    </p>
    <p>"Well, they're kind of the same."
    </p>
    <p>The content of the game itself was not important, but the fact that it was a suggestion from
        Ryuen was what caught my attention.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe Ibuki was successfully lured into the trap.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, it's bad to interrupt Ibuki any more than I already have.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll spread the word later about what you've been working so hard to promote here."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't spread it. I'll knock you on your feet."
    </p>
    <p>I hurriedly avoided a sharp kick at the same time as her costume swayed.
    </p>
    <p>"Tch"
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, by the way, the greeting at the cafe is 'Welcome home, master.' Just give it a try."
    </p>
    <p>"I'll say it if you'll take my kick to your face."
    </p>
    <p>"I think I’ll pass on it."
    </p>
    <p>She raised her leg slightly to threaten me, so I shrugged and left.
    </p>
    <p>The rather laid-back mood that was present earlier in the day had vanished by the time I arrived
        back at the maid cafe, and the biggest crowd of the day had started to form a queue.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita also joined the line, and started guiding the guests.
    </p>
    <p>"It appears that you were able to start distributing flyers without any issues."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. From this point on, you and Ryuen's class should start to outpace the others."
    </p>
    <p>"Everything is going according to your plan."
    </p>
    <p>I'm not the one who added the unique element to it, though, I just accompanied and acted as
        support.
    </p>
    <p>I nodded to Horikita, and we both turned to our separate positions after that.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 5</h3>
    <p>
        The Maid Cafe was headed in the right direction. The fact that Ryuen made his plans public at
        an early stage, meanwhile, might have worked against him because no other classes followed
        suit, effectively drawing clients.
    </p>
    <p>This in itself was a welcome development, but a problem that had not occurred during the
        rehearsal arose.
    </p>
    <p>The problem was that there were too many customers due to the confrontational attitude that
        had been adopted between Class B and C.
    </p>
    <p>There was already an extreme amount of seating in the classroom, so adding more would just
        make the situation worse.
    </p>
    <p>The only option was to make the customers wait in line, but maid cafes aren't known for having
        a quick service.
    </p>
    <p>It was essential that students dressed as maids also enjoyed conversing with the adults.
    </p>
    <p>Usually, in such a situation, we would consider handing out numbered tickets and asking people
        to come back later.
    </p>
    <p>However, in a cultural festival, this was not a good idea.
    </p>
    <p>What would a customer with 3,000 points left in their pocket do if they received a numbered
        ticket and were asked to come back in an hour?
    </p>
    <p>Some customers would do so dutifully, but most would drop their money at another place during
        the waiting time.
    </p>
    <p>The next thing you know, they've spent almost 3,000 points, and they have no more money to
        drop at the maid cafe, so they leave without stopping by.
    </p>
    <p>This is a development that happens in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>That was why we wanted customers who had lined up once to keep lining up until they entered
        the store and spent their money.
    </p>
    <p>And if possible, we even wanted to take the points they plan to drop elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>"This is bad. We’re starting to see customers tired of waiting and they are leaving."
    </p>
    <p>The prospect of taking a risk and getting a big payoff was now a warning sign.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun, can I leave for a bit? I have a plan."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida called out to me as I was about to walk to the end of the line.
    </p>
    <p>She must have been curious to see what was going on and came to check on the situation.
    </p>
    <p>"What are you planning on doing?"
    </p>
    <p>"The guests who are waiting are bored, but they all show strong interest in the maid cafe. Sine
        they are getting hungry it’s not surprising they are starting to leave."
    </p>
    <p>"You’re right."
    </p>
    <p>Since it was also right around lunchtime, it was obvious from the adults now in the classroom
        that many of them were there for food and drinks.
    </p>
    <p>Kushida picked up one of the bags filled with homemade cookies that she had been selling ,
    </p>
    <p>prepared for souvenirs and started walking down the hallway with it.
    </p>
    <p>Then, with a smile, she called out to the now bored customers.
    </p>
    <p>"I’m sorry for the wait!"
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image7.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        She then pulled a cookie out of the bag and started handing them out to the waiting crowd. She
        may be aiming to fill their bellies just a little, but there was more to it than that.
    </p>
    <p>Once they receive something in return, they may feel guilty about leaving the place.
    </p>
    <p>If Kushida were to leave her current post, it would not be difficult for someone to run away from
        the line with some guilt on their back, but she stayed and continued to talk to them with a smile
        on her face.
    </p>
    <p>After receiving the cookies, it was no longer easy to leave the line, even though they were
        impatient.
    </p>
    <p>There were some disadvantages to Kushida leaving the hall, but the customers who had
        already taken their seats were certain to spend some money.
    </p>
    <p>For now, it was more important to bring the money-generating presence beyond that point.
    </p>
    <p>She could see what was going on in the restaurant better than anyone else, and she also knew
        how to make the most of herself.
    </p>
    <p>What could she do to get as many people on her side as possible?
    </p>
    <p>She knew how to get close to adults of the opposite sex, engaged them in conversation that
        made them feel good, and sometimes even held their hand or did other skinship with them.
    </p>
    <p>They showed not the slightest resistance or aversion to this behavior.
    </p>
    <p>The other girls had been working hard all day, but Kushida was the only one who had managed
        to do all of these things perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>Even when she was accounting at times, she made as few mistakes as possible, even when
        she stumbled over a calculation.
    </p>
    <p>This was truly a gift, as she had never participated in any real-life practice sessions.
    </p>
    <p>"Kushida-san's abilities are quite something. This is her element, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>Yosuke nodded his head in respect as he looked at her workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>"It seems that Kushida-san and Horikita-san, who have been facing strong headwinds, will also
        have some tailwinds."
    </p>
    <p>They've done such a good job, I had to admit that to some extent.
    </p>
    <p>"People are creatures that resent easily, but on the other hand, they are also creatures that
        admit easily. Especially when you are young, evaluations are like the two sides of a coin. From
        the front to the back, and now back to the front again. But the more you're pushed around, the
        more you'll feel like a tired presence."
    </p>
    <p>"Still, I'm fine with it, as long as Kushida-san is able to fight alongside everyone in the class."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm really impressed by what I'm seeing."
    </p>
    <p>"I think it's a cumulative process. During the preparations for the festival, Kushida-san visited
        Horikita-san's room late at night several times. I think they were practicing."
    </p>
    <p>So, in addition to her own talent, she was practicing well behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>If Yosuke's reading of Kushida's life was correct, it was a reminder of Kushida's greatness.
    </p>
    <p>It would also confirm Horikita's confidence that Kushida was in good hands.
    </p>
    <p>We then went back to the waiting room and spent about 30 minutes pulling the camera around.
    </p>
    <p>"Um, Ayanokoji-kun, where is Kushida-san?"
    </p>
    <p>Mii-chan came out of the room, looking busy.
    </p>
    <p>"Kushida?"
    </p>
    <p>"There's a customer who wants to take a picture with Kushida-san, but I can't find her."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida-san, who was supposed to be organizing the line, had disappeared?
    </p>
    <p>Yosuke and I immediately looked down the hallway, and sure enough, Kushida was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>"Excuse me, have you seen a girl standing in line here?" Yōsuke called out to the guests in line.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, you mean the girl who was handing out cookies? It looks like she was approached by a girl
        from the same school and followed her about five minutes ago."
    </p>
    <p>"What was she like?"
    </p>
    <p>I asked about the person who approached her, as if interrupting a conversation.
    </p>
    <p>"Um, a girl with her hair tied up in two knots."
    </p>
    <p>Yosuke didn't seem to have a clue, but I had a strong idea.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but I need you to take care of the store for a bit and direct me to another maid the
        way Kushida did."
    </p>
    <p>This was the kind of trouble no one expected. That's why I knew immediately that it was a
        problem I had to deal with.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 6</h3>
    <p>
        It is difficult to find a specific person at a cultural festival where many people of all ages and
        genders are present.
    </p>
    <p>And even more so if you are dealing with someone who you cannot predict about where they
        are going.
    </p>
    <p>While operating my cell phone, I sigh in admiration at the overwhelming network of information.
    </p>
    <p>I'm amazed at the speed and accuracy with which I can obtain location information within
        minutes of making contact.
    </p>
    <p>The Location was not in the direction of the Keyaki Mall or the dormitories, but behind the indoor
        pool facility.
    </p>
    <p>When I arrived there, I found Kushida's back facing me, dressed in an out-of-place maid outfit.
    </p>
    <p>"So don't make me say it again…"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida, who was probably having a heated conversation with the other party, was shouting at
        her.
    </p>
    <p>"Wow…"
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the other person immediately noticed me and told Kushida to stop talking.
    </p>
    <p>"What? Why is... Ayanokoji-kun here..?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course he’s going to look for the ace when you’ve disappeared."
    </p>
    <p>That’s true.
    </p>
    <p>Although I let the substitute maid take over the queueing example set by Kushida, I'm not sure
        how much longer she can maintain the same pace as Kushida.
    </p>
    <p>"I thought I had taken her out well, but how did you find this place, senpai?"
    </p>
    <p>The way she's talking, it seems that she was waiting for the moment when I wasn't around to
        take Kushida with her.
    </p>
    <p>"Unfortunately for you, I am working with someone I can rely on now. No matter where anyone
        goes, I’ll be sure to know where they are."
    </p>
    <p>Even Amasawa doesn't seem to have any idea who it was, but she didn’t inquire any further
        "She was going to go right back after this, right senpai~?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. She's right. I'm sorry I slipped out without telling you, but I also wanted to talk to
        Amasawa-san for a minute."
    </p>
    <p>"Then you could have just stood there and talked, that's no reason to leave for 10 or 20
        minutes."
    </p>
    <p>"That's…"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida knew that the top priority was to organize the line and keep the customers in line. Still,
    </p>
    <p>Kushida abandoned customer service to handle the situation. Unless it was something serious,
    </p>
    <p>she would not leave from her position.
    </p>
    <p>"Whatever there is between the two of you, we’re busy with the festival. Can you talk about it
        some other time?"
    </p>
    <p>There was no need to go to the trouble of choosing today as the day for the exchange.
    </p>
    <p>"You are not the least bit surprised to see me and Kushida-senpai together, are you? Did you
        know about our history?"
    </p>
    <p>"No."
    </p>
    <p>Until now, I really didn't know there was a deep connection between these two.
    </p>
    <p>"But today, with this timely contact, I understand everything."
    </p>
    <p>Even information that seemed unnecessary was derived in my head on its own.
    </p>
    <p>Why was Kushida so adamant about expelling me from the school in the unanimous special
        exam, and why did she take such reckless risks?
    </p>
    <p>If a student from the white room was behind it and forced her to do it, it was not unreasonable.
    </p>
    <p>I could also see why they acted at this festival, where they could not be easily traced. After
        school, Kushida's behavior was also consistent with the fact that she had kicked off invitations
        from her classmates and headed somewhere else.
    </p>
    <p>"Kushida-senpai will return later, so can you give me a little time?"
    </p>
    <p>Amazawa in front of me still doesn't realize that I have arrived at the answer.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry Ayanokoji-kun, could you please excuse me. I'll be back as soon as I can. I also really
        need to talk to Amasawa-san."
    </p>
    <p>"I see what you mean, but it's not going to happen. This is enough, Amasawa."
    </p>
    <p>"Senpai's eyes are so naughty, aren't they? You’re looking at me like I’m naked or something~"
    </p>
    <p>Amasawa pressed the tip of her finger against her lips in a seductive manner, but the tone
        wasn’t sexual. It was an action to hide her wariness that I can see right through her.
    </p>
    <p>"Kushida. You had a weakness regarding your past with Amazawa and one other person. That's
        why you forced the class to get involved in the expulsion in the unanimous special examination
        so that Horikita and I could be expelled, or perhaps you had been working with them on
        something even before that."
    </p>
    <p>"Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>I must have been right on target; unable to confirm or deny, Kushida simply looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>"Let's stop now, senpai. This is a time for me and Kushida-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but it doesn't work that way. Even before working as a maid, Kushida is a necessary
        presence in the class."
    </p>
    <p>"What does that mean? I'm not doing anything wrong."
    </p>
    <p>"You may be not, but what about the other one?"
    </p>
    <p>When I replied, this was the first time I saw a change in Amazawa's attitude.
    </p>
    <p>Immediately afterward, Amazawa, with an eerie smile on her face, grabbed the wrist of Kushida.
    </p>
    <p>"What?!"
    </p>
    <p>She then pulled her close and stood behind Kushida with her right hand locked in place and
        forcefully closed Kushida's mouth with her left hand.
    </p>
    <p>"Perhaps Senpai has an idea of who the other student is?"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida's words were silenced before Amasawa asked this question because Kushida knew the
        person directly.
    </p>
    <p>In other words, she knew who the other white room student was.
    </p>
    <p>That's why she went ahead herself to do it. So that Kushida wouldn't suddenly blurt out that
        person's name.
    </p>
    <p>"You know, Kushida-senpai, if you say anything, I'll have you expelled, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida's face contorted in pain, probably due to the tight grip on her right arm.
    </p>
    <p>"This isn’t like you, Amasawa. You seem like you’ve been cornered pretty badly."
    </p>
    <p>"Wait, senpai, I didn't say anything, did I?"
    </p>
    <p>"Every single action speaks for itself."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida, enduring the pain, would not understand the nature of this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>And Amasawa herself didn't know how much I understood.
    </p>
    <p>"Let’s talk about it again later, just the two of us next time. Please pretend you didn’t see this
        and leave, Ayanokoji-senpai. If you do that, I’ll let her go in about ten minutes."
    </p>
    <p>"What if I don't say yes?"
    </p>
    <p>"I might make Kushida-senpai as useless as a dead person then."
    </p>
    <p>She said and squeezed her right arm even tighter.
    </p>
    <p>"Nuh uh!"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm a pretty girl, but I can easily break an arm or two."
    </p>
    <p>"Then let's give it a try. Let's see if you break Kushida's arm first, or if I can stop you.
    </p>
    <p>The distance between me and Amasawa was about 5 meters.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you serious?"
    </p>
    <p>"Are you serious about breaking her arm? Or are you saying that you don't think I can stop
        you?"
    </p>
    <p>"Both."
    </p>
    <p>"Then you're wrong on both counts. You really need to get serious."
    </p>
    <p>Laughing, Amazawa loosens her grip on Kushida's right arm, albeit slightly.
    </p>
    <p>At that moment I kicked the ground and dove in just as Amasawa switched to a motion to break
        her arm.
    </p>
    <p>My right hand slid down Kushida's arm and reached her wrist as my left hand went around her
        mouth to her back, I grabbed Amasawa's right hand.
    </p>
    <p>"No way..."
    </p>
    <p>It must be a defensive instinct. In an instant, she abandoned the action of breaking Kushida's
        arm and shifted her attention to me, and tried to make a left fist with a tight grip.
    </p>
    <p>However, I didn’t give Amasawa any chance to make any further movements, and caught her,
    </p>
    <p>blocking her from moving towards Kushida.
    </p>
    <p>Just as Amasawa had done to Kushida earlier, I went behind her and twisted her body to the
        ground with her arm behind her back.
    </p>
    <p>"Fuu~!"
    </p>
    <p>The forceful hold on the ground caused Amasawa to lose her breath for a moment and gasp for
        air. Her breath caused a slight dust cloud to rise.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh my, that was... a little unexpected."
    </p>
    <p>"Did you think there wasn't much difference between you and me?"
    </p>
    <p>I could tell by the look in her eyes. Amasawa's pride, which was always high, was deeply
        wounded.
    </p>
    <p>"You mean I was wrong about your abilities?"
    </p>
    <p>"Probably."
    </p>
    <p>Amazawa's fighting ability, which she has learned in the White Room, is real. Horikita and Ibuki,
    </p>
    <p>who have trained properly, or even Ryuen and the others, who have learned fighting in their own
        way, would not be able to beat Amazawa.
    </p>
    <p>However, whether she can compete with me on an equal footing is a completely different matter.
    </p>
    <p>Even if your opponent's skill level goes up from 5 to 20 or even 30, it will be the same situation if
        your skill level is close to 100.
    </p>
    <p>"Since when did you think you could beat me?"
    </p>
    <p>"From the moment we met."
    </p>
    <p>"If it wasn’t for Ayanokoji-senpai’s words, it would be too excessive."
    </p>
    <p>"I'll tell you this, you seem to think that the other student might push me out of school, but did
        you ever wonder why I never asked for the other student’s name?"
    </p>
    <p>The smile slowly faded from Amasawa.
    </p>
    <p>Up until now, I had never willingly sought out a white room student on my own.
    </p>
    <p>"That's because I didn't think they would be a match for me from the start."
    </p>
    <p>"You mean… are you serious Senpai?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's not you who doesn't understand that, right, Amasawa?"
    </p>
    <p>If you had only half-heartedly practiced martial arts, you would not have had any real feeling for
        it yet. But Amasawa was different.
    </p>
    <p>Even so, in less than 10 seconds of total movement, the match had already been decided by a
        wide margin.
    </p>
    <p>"You and the other student should have challenged me at an early stage. You shouldn't have
        gone around and involved the people around you in the fun."
    </p>
    <p>"So, you understood why I contacted Kushida-senpai..."
    </p>
    <p>"It all connected just now. And now the unexpected is about to happen."
    </p>
    <p>"The unexpected?"
    </p>
    <p>"After 3 p.m., keep an eye on the student council room. Make sure to not be seen in front of
        anyone. Then you'll have all the answers."
    </p>
    <p>Seeing Amasawa's strength slowly slipping away, I released the restraints.
    </p>
    <p>There was no need for any more forceful techniques.
    </p>
    <p>"We've wasted a lot of time. Let's go back to the maid cafe."
    </p>
    <p>"Is it okay leaving her?"
    </p>
    <p>Amasawa stood up, but there was no emotion in her face.
    </p>
    <p>"It's okay. You don't have to worry about your past being exposed."
    </p>
    <p>I started to walk away and Kushida rushed after me.
    </p>
    <p>"How could Ayanokoji-kun know that?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don’t worry about it, but you can trust me."
    </p>
    <p>"Who is Ayanokoji-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>That question would be inevitable if you had witnessed the conversation and fight with
        Amasawa earlier.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know anything about fighting, but I can tell you’re not normal."
    </p>
    <p>"It's not uncommon for classmates to learn martial arts. Horikita and Ibuki, even Ryuen and
        Akito should be strong in fights, even if they are self-taught. It's not like boys and girls can
        compete with each other from the start."
    </p>
    <p>I would explain that it was only overwhelming due to the gender difference.
    </p>
    <p>Whether Kushida would be convinced by that is another matter.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll have to get back soon and help them get in line. Please go back yourself."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, sure."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida replied, bowing her head as if she had made up her mind to do something.
    </p>
    <p>"Thank you for helping me."
    </p>
    <p>An unexpected thank you from Kushida. Of course, Kushida was easily more down-to-earth
        than most people on the external front. She was the type of person for whom expressing
        gratitude itself was easy enough to do.
    </p>
    <p>"You don't think I'm sincerely grateful, but that's fine. I just felt like saying so, even if it's a lie."
    </p>
    <p>"It's not a big deal. It's more of a natural behaviour for a classmate."
    </p>
    <p>"Then you don't have to consider this as a debt, right?"
    </p>
    <p>She emphasised that part, and I thought about it for a moment, but I didn’t feel like indebting
        her.
    </p>
    <p>"Of course."
    </p>
    <p>If I did consider her to be in my debt because of what happened, she wouldn’t really be able to
        repay me.
    </p>
    <p></p>
