    <h1>Epilogue</h1>
    <h2>Arrival of Autumn</h2>
    <p>
        "Sorry to keep you waiting."
    </p>
    <p>Hasebe lightly tapped Miyake's shoulder as she called out to him from the front entrance.
    </p>
    <p>"No, I haven't waited for long. I was bored anyway."
    </p>
    <p>Hasebe missed a week of school but has been showing up at school every day since then.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you fine you quit the Archery Club?"
    </p>
    <p>"It was like passing time aimlessly, to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>"It's my fault, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>"No. I just quit because I wanted to quit. Better than that, I'm glad you're coming to school."
    </p>
    <p>She participated in only the minimum five events at the gymnastics festival.
    </p>
    <p>She also contributed to the class at the very least, although not in terms of results.
    </p>
    <p>However, she rarely speaks to anyone other than Miyake and has a strained relationship with
        Yukimura, who agreed to expel Sakura from the school.
    </p>
    <p>Miyake stands by her side, silent, as though this is something that can't be avoided at this point.
    </p>
    <p>"At first, I wanted to destroy everything, not only Kiyopon but all the classmates who abandoned
        Airi. I know I'm a bad guy."
    </p>
    <p>"No, ——I know how you feel."
    </p>
    <p>"Someone had to be expelled from that exam. But it had to be Kushida-san because that was
        the original promise. Right?"
    </p>
    <p>"...... Yes."
    </p>
    <p>"I will not forgive Kiyopon. I won't forgive my classmates. But I thought it was wrong to keep
        dragging you down and making you suffer."
    </p>
    <p>She tells Miyake the answer that went through all his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, Miyachi. Will you help me in taking my revenge?"
    </p>
    <p>Her eyes were not smiling, and Miyake did not have the courage to ask back if she was really
        serious.
    </p>
    <p>"Haruka ......"
    </p>
    <p>"What a Joke."
    </p>
    <p>Laughing and deceiving, Haruka begins to walk.
    </p>

        "I'll take my revenge alone."
    </p>
    <p>"I——"
    </p>
    <p>He tried to reach out to Hasebe with his hand but then withdrew it.
    </p>
    <p>She turns her back and walks away.
    </p>
    <p>Despite his hesitation, Miyake silently began to walk behind her.
    </p>

    <h2>Afterword</h2>
    <p>
        Both to newcomers and to people who have been here before, Welcome.
    </p>
    <p>I'm Kinugasa Shougo. I'm gonna be a bit serious this time, as you will see soon.
    </p>
    <p>After five years, [Classroom of the Elite] got a new season. It's such a short time when written
        like this, but I've had to overcome many difficulties to get to this point. I even stopped writing
        once or twice.
    </p>
    <p>From time to time, I got worried about the anime's continuation. But, the reason that I’ve been
        able to keep writing at this pace, is because of all the fans that have been supporting me,
    </p>
    <p>especially since the anime's release in 2017.
    </p>
    <p>Without this support, the anime would never have been renewed.
    </p>
    <p>As a writer, I couldn't be happier, I'm very grateful for all this. Thank you all very, very much.
    </p>
    <p>Please let me say that much, at least.
    </p>
    <p>More than anyone, I want the anime to continue. It has been around two years since the talks of
        a renewal started; right when around the global pandemic, unfortunately, was starting up.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, I'm grateful that I can safely tell you about the news now, after all that time and
        trouble.
    </p>
    <p>We will do our best to connect it. Moreover, of course, I will continue on this original work and try
        to make it as interesting as I can. There's a lot more that I want to tell you all, but this is it for
        now.
    </p>
    <p>It's been a long time, but I'm happy that we'll get to see Ayanokoji and the others again.
    </p>
    <p>"Won't you do an anime till the end of the story? Won't you!? Won't you!!?"
    </p>
    <p>Well, leaving all that aside.... Woohooo!!! I did it!!!
    </p>
    <p>Everyone, once again, I hope you all enjoy it!!!
    </p>
    <p>TL Note:
    </p>
