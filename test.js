Consequently, the first round and day of the exchange meeting started.

We received the game and rules from the school.

Group Nine was the team we were going up against. Ike and Keisei from Horikita's class were present.

It was called 'Flower Arrangement.' 

There was a Flower Arrangement classroom there.

It's possible that some students joked upon hearing it.

However, I was being really serious.

In this instance, the ultimate concern was the quality of the final product in order to compete in flower arrangement. 

The blending of many flower varieties. 

Whether or not you were able to locate petals that were the proper moisture content and a variety of suitable flower materials in various sizes.

They were delicate, so the question was whether you could finish it without breaking or harming it. 

The sum of these variable scores would determine the winner. 

Since I hadn't visited the training camp when I was called up, I hadn't had a chance to experience anything, so I made the decision to head directly to the facility. 

Just before, we had a quick lecture, but this one seemed much more in-depth than I had anticipated. 

All participants completed the assignment at the same time, and we would compete one-on-one in the conclusion.

From the first to the fifth, it was predetermined who would be in charge.

There were ten participants from both groups, two leaders, and a few viewers, including Hashimoto, at the assigned production site. 

Takahashi Osamu, a first-year Class A student from the Nagumo group, was one of them.

By the way, I took part as the third person in line, adhering to the guidelines at the time.

“Do you, Ayanokoji-senpai, also make flower arrangements?”

One of my opponents, first-year Class D student Nanase Tsubasa, approached me and inquired.

“No, I haven't carried it out. I recently received some advice from my friend.”

That friend, by the way, was Hiyori.

She had a great deal of experience and had been using flower arrangement to make bookmarks for a long time.

“I understand. Since you were the only boy taking part, I assumed you were skilled at it.”

Maybe because it demanded skilled hands, as nine out of ten competitors were female, according to Nanase. 

I felt a little out of place because I was the only male participant. 

I had a match with Nagumo, but since Nanase had no bearing on our contest, there was no need to inform her.

“I don't know if I can do it well; I've only done it once or twice.”

“Please be gentle with me.”

Although I was concerned that the scoring criteria would be a little ambiguous, it appeared that the individual in charge of flower arrangement—who also happens to be the person running the facility—was a knowledgeable and strict judge. 

Luckily, I was able to defeat my opponent by going up against her head-on because she wasn't a very skilled first-year student.

Regarding the group's standing, we just about prevailed with three victories and two defeats, despite the fact that the result remained unclear until the fifth game.

“You're very remarkable, Ayanokoji-kun. I believe that for your first try, you're doing quite well.”

“But I'm not nearly as good as Hiyori.”

At first appearance, both were stunning flower arrangements, but the quality was very different.

I would have been completely destroyed if she had been my opponent.

“You're really good at this, Ayanokoji-kun. Let's make it together next time if you like.”

“Yes, I would like to improve in this as well.”

That such a fierce opponent could also be an ally brought me relief. 

The fact that I had prevailed in the individual competition was noteworthy.

I would have preferred to quietly carry on creating them in the flower arranging classroom.

I wouldn't mind participating in a three-day straight flower arranging competition.

I was experiencing strong emotions, but I had to control them.

Apologies, flower arrangements. 

See you Later.

Subtly, after the first game, Kiryuuin called out to me.

“A win is an ideal place to start. However, I didn't sense any strain.”

“Yes, that is true.”

I said nothing about how serious I had been in my response.

During the game, whispering was permitted. 

It was inevitable that the audience would become disinterested.

“But it's normal for anyone to win or lose in an experience-based learning competition. It's a really intriguing method of selecting the winner when you take the school's objectives into account. Simply assembling students with excellent OAA talents is pointless. Every team has an opportunity to succeed.”

Not even the famed Nagumo could predict or ascertain Horikita and the others' ability to produce quality flower arrangements. 

Having said that, we may say the same thing. 

What we were able and unable to do. 

Utilize our free time to enhance our skills by participating in as many experiential learning opportunities as you can. 

These items belong in the hands of a leader…

“This list was created by Hashimoto for me, which simplifies things. He's quite helpful.”

As a leader, Kiryuuin appeared to enjoy avoiding the hassle. 

That was okay too, I suppose. 

It was an ideal way to have fun throughout the three days rather than take winning too seriously.

“If we keep going in this direction, you won't need to take command very often.”

“I am appreciative of that. All I'm interested in seeing is your match with Nagumo.”

She appeared to have no intention of doing anything, as was to be expected.

“I don't believe the outcomes will live up to your expectations.”

I saw that Inogashira was staring at us by herself when we were having this chat. She most likely didn't play in the first game, based on the circumstances. She mentioned that she could sew well and that she would also enjoy flower arrangement.

“What's going on, Inogashira?”

She came over to me a little nervous when I questioned her out of curiosity. 

When Kiryuuin saw this, she moved aside to give her more room to speak.

“Ayanokoji-kun, you're good friends with Koenji-kun, aren't you?”

"What?"

I responded right away. 

It was the first I had heard that Koenji and I were close friends.

“Is that true? I see.”

“What is the issue?”

“Well, I was instructed to bring Koenji-kun back by Tatebayashi-senpai.”

Tatebayashi is the head of the third-year Class D group, which includes Inogashira and Koenji.

“He was furious.”

“Yes.”

Being a classmate and a member of the same group, it appeared that the shy Inogashira was made to assume charge of overseeing Koenji.

“I was hoping you could take some action.”

Our eyes had met when she had been viewing the situation earlier. 

She must have come in a desperate attempt to get assistance, but the other person was just too much to handle.

“Maybe you should ask Yosuke?”

When I attempted to suggest the most practical course of action, Inogashira shook her head.

“I am unable to request Hirata-kun to take this action... It's asking for too much.”

I wonder then if it's okay to ask me...?  

Well, comparing myself to Yosuke—who was really helpful—would be impolite. 

He would agree if asked, and he would probably keep trying to convince him until Koenji came back. 

It made sense to me that Inogashira would experience guilt.

“I apologize. I'm unable to assist you. Nothing I can do will help.”

“I see. I apologize. I'll try to work things out.”

With a small bow on her head, Inogashira moved slowly away.

“Should we just leave things as they are?”

“Although I do feel bad for her, that man won't do what we want of him. After experimenting with a number of different approaches over the previous two years, this is the conclusion we reached.”

“Naturally, the choice is yours. Whatever the specifics, it matters that she approached us first.”

“You take unusual things seriously. I'm not excited about it, but I won't deny it either.”

Since my last conversation with Mii-chan, my policies and thoughts toward Koenji had become clear. 

Any needless interaction or communication would now be pointless in the absence of a particular exam that threatened expulsion.

“Why not give it a try? There's still some time until the next game. Based on my observations, Tatebayashi's team appears to be small and unlikely to prevail; nevertheless, if Koenji is capable, things could perhaps improve. Correct?”

Although it would be improper for me to say so, he didn't seem to be the kind of person who worried about other people.

I wanted to try a lot of various things, but it didn't seem like there were many options for that.

“I see. Now, I'll try to get in touch with him. Should Koenji prevail, he may value the extra points he will receive.”

“It's a wise idea.”

As a matter of truth, Koenji could only be motivated by that.

I chose to try it even though I felt like I had been asked to do something difficult.
