The next day arrived. It was nearly 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning.

Seated on the couch in the dorm lobby, I awaited my meeting with Mii-chan.

Kei, who had quietly stayed over in my room on Friday night and spent the early hours of the morning with me, was sound asleep. I intended to postpone our originally planned date to an afternoon date.

As I observed Mii-chan in the elevator on the monitor, I stood up from the comfortable sofa.

“Good morning.”

“Good morning, Ayanokoji-kun.”

She clutched a paper bag, presumably holding a thank-you gift purchased the previous day.

“So, where are you meeting Koenji?”

“Huh?”

“Isn’t that where you’re headed next?”

“Well…”

“So, you are meeting him?”

“...Actually, um… not really.”

With Mii-chan’s reply, the atmosphere around us froze. Silence stretched, but I couldn't let it go forever. 

Resuming the conversation, I addressed the issue.

“So, Koenji is unaware of today’s plans.”

Mii-chan, whose expressions were a mix of agreement and distress, seemed on the verge of tears.

“Ah, it should have been the obvious choice, shouldn't it? I wasn't thinking clearly with all the nerves and tension. I assumed you had arranged everything. It was my mistake... I'm really sorry.”

As she spoke, tears welled up in Mii-chan's eyes, about to spill over.

Thankfully, the lobby was empty, but it would be problematic if anyone walked in and saw her in tears.

“First, let's calm down. While I'm not close with Koenji, I have an idea of where to find him.”

“Really?”

Though it wasn't a guarantee, I was fairly confident I could locate him.

“I believe Koenji might be at the gym around this time.”

“The gym? The one on the second floor of Keyaki Mall?”

“Exactly. I've been going there myself recently. Koenji often comes on Saturday and Sunday mornings.”

I had noticed him leaving after his workouts around noon on multiple occasions.

With a newfound sense of optimism, Mii-chan composed herself, and we headed towards Keyaki Mall.

As we walked, I stole a glance at Mii-chan, her eyes still tinged red. Despite her academic prowess and quiet demeanour, she seemed remarkably vulnerable when faced with unexpected situations.

She wasn't an entirely uncommon type, not exactly rare, but the kind of high school girl you could encounter just about anywhere.

This made her connection to Koenji all the more intriguing.

Regardless of personal preferences, objectively speaking, Mii-chan's appearance was above average.

Perhaps she happened to fit Koenji's preferences and was being secretly favoured by him.

However, Koenji didn't strike me as the type to keep his romantic interests a secret.

If anything, if he had feelings for someone in the class, he seemed more likely to make his intentions known.

It was a contradiction for someone so self-assured to shy away from pursuing someone they liked. 

If that were the case, it suggested that Koenji might not be as confident as he appeared.

—Then again, maybe not.

People have their own unique ways of expressing affection. 

Koenji might argue that he prefers to keep his distance from the women he likes as a form of showing his interest. 

I considered various possibilities, but ultimately, I could only reach one conclusion.

Attempting to decipher Koenji's thoughts would likely be fruitless.

In the end, the only way to understand his true intentions was to speak with him directly.

We made our way into Keyaki Mall, which was already bustling with activity, and headed straight to the second floor.

I instructed Mii-chan to wait outside the gym while I went in.

“Just as I thought, he's here.”

As expected, Koenji was in the midst of his workout routine.

It appeared that he was focused on the bench press, a routine he would likely complete soon.

After all, Koenji always concluded his gym sessions with the bench press.

Despite the physical strain, he was effortlessly lifting 200 kilograms, with a smile despite the sheen of sweat.

I couldn't help but wonder if there were any other second-year high school students capable of such a feat.

Regardless, it was evident that he was nearing the end of his session. 

It was only a matter of time before he headed to the showers and then made his exit.

To avoid any potential awkward encounters, I promptly exited the training area.

Outside, I was greeted by Akiyama-san, a staff member at the gym, with whom I exchanged brief pleasantries before making my departure.

While I had also planned to meet with Mashima-sensei, I decided that it could wait for another day.

“How did it go?”

“I think he'll be done in about 20 or 30 minutes. If you're okay with it, we could wait here.”

“Yes.”

We settled onto a bench near the gym entrance and waited.

“...”

“...”

With little conversation between us, we simply listened to the ambient music playing inside the Keyaki Mall.

“I'm starting to feel a bit nervous.”

As the time approached, she seemed to sense the anticipation building.

“I have no idea how Koenji will react to this.”

“Neither do I...”

“By the way, what did you decide on for the gift?”

“Um, I wasn't sure what to get him, so I settled on a face towel and a hand towel.”

“Wow... That's quite an unexpected choice.”

“Perhaps, but I thought it might suit him. I often see Koenji using both.”

“Is that so? I knew about the hand mirror, but not this.”

“Yes. I thought if it was a luxurious, organic cotton towel, he might appreciate it, so... Oh...”

“That sounds like a significant purchase.”

It seemed Mii-chan hadn't quite followed my advice about keeping the gift small.

“Uh... y-yes. I'm sorry...”

“How much did it cost?”

“Well... about ¥12,000.”

So, it was roughly the same price as the total amount given, or perhaps a bit more. 

Given Mii-chan's personality, it was a predictable situation.

“It's okay. Let's hope Koenji likes it.”

“Yes. I need to properly show my gratitude for his help.”

Despite her nerves and flustered state, Mii-chan responded with determination.

In the end, choosing a gift that exceeded the budget might have been the right decision.

After waiting for nearly 40 minutes, longer than expected, Koenji emerged from the gym.

“Ah, He's coming out.”

From our sitting point, it seemed Koenji immediately noticed us, but he showed no change in expression as he walked past us without saying a word. 

We appeared to be of no interest to him. Observing his behaviour, it was difficult to believe that he harboured any affection for Mii-chan or had been secretly supporting her.

However, based on the convenience store clerk's testimony, we were 99% certain it was Koenji.

Therefore, the only option was to confirm the truth with him. 

Mii-chan quickly rose from the bench and began to follow after Koenji.

“Um, Koenji-kun! Can I talk to you for a moment?”

Mii-chan called out from behind him, causing Koenji to halt and elegantly turn to look back.

“Do you need something from me, Wang girl?”

“Eh, what did you just— call me, Wang what?”

Koenji must have referred to Mii-chan's real name, Wang Mei-Yui, calling her “Wang girl,” a nickname likely only Koenji would use, which led to Mii-chan's confusion.

Although Mii-chan appeared puzzled by the nickname, she suppressed her confusion and fortified her resolve.

She tightly grasped the handles of the paper bag she held in front of her.

“I wanted to discuss something with you. Can I have a moment of your time, please?”

Mii-chan addressed Koenji with a polite but determined tone, albeit softly spoken.

Koenji seemed to contemplate her request for a moment, then raised his arm briskly and shook his head.

“I'm sorry, but I'm a bit pressed for time right now. Let's talk another time. Hahaha.”

With that, he chuckled toward us, turned his back, and resumed walking away.

“Eh, um… ah…”

Mii-chan, who appeared to be someone who carefully weighed her options, was visibly flustered by Koenji's unexpected rejection. 

I couldn't help but feel somewhat surprised as well.

“What should we do now...?”

“Should we try again?”

“Oh... It took a lot of courage for me to approach him this time... I'm not sure if I can muster that again.”

It would undoubtedly be a significant challenge for Mii-chan to approach Koenji in the same situation once more. In that case, our only option was to persist today.

“Then we should just follow Koenji.”

“But wouldn't that be quite bothersome?”

“Normally, yes. But if you can't try again, then regardless of the inconvenience, we have to proceed, don't we?”

If the inconvenience is just someone walking around, I feel like he wouldn't be too bothered by it.

“What should we do? If we lose sight of him, we'll have no choice but to give up.”

She couldn't make a decision, wavering between moving forward and stepping back.

It was evident from her demeanour that following Koenji was her main intention. 

So, should I continue to take the lead as I had been?

“I'll take responsibility if we get caught following him. Let's go.”

“Y-yes!”

And that's how we decided to tail Koenji, observing from a distance. 

I didn't see the need for secrecy, but Mii-chan was eager, so I chose not to voice any unnecessary objections. 

I descended the stairs as Koenji rode down the escalator, carefully tracking his direction while positioning Mii-chan behind me. 

Meanwhile, with his long strides, Koenji ventured deeper into the mall.

“Shouldn't we hurry? We might lose him.”

“It's okay if we do.”

Most people visited the mall daily, and students typically had a mental map of the area.

While there were several shops in Koenji's path, none had extensive floor depths. 

A quick glance would reveal all the customers. 

At the far end was an open cafe area. 

Unless he used one of the several exits prepared along the way, we had no concerns about losing sight of him.

Considering those exits, if he were heading home, it would be quicker to return the way he came.

The likelihood of him needing to use a specific exit wasn't very high.

At the foot of the stairs, I glimpsed Koenji's receding figure, now smaller in the distance.

“He seems to be heading to the cafe. That should make things easier for us.”

“Indeed.”

After confirming from a distance that Koenji had finished ordering and was holding a cup, I moved closer and noticed Koenji sitting at a two-person table with a female student.

“Who's she?”

“That's Enoshima Midoriko from class 3-B.”

“Do you know her?”

“I've only seen her on the OAA app. Let's get closer.”

“But won't Koenji-kun notice us if we get closer?”

“Well, we've been tailing him this far, but I wonder if it's really necessary.”

We should be able to wait close by, till Koenji's meeting is done. It would be worse, of course, to imply that we were hiding and biding our time until she left him alone. 

“At this point, I'd like to know what kind of conversations Koenji usually has.”

However, Mii-chan seemed to have flipped a switch, appearing reluctant to be discovered.

“You mean eavesdrop?”

“I know it's wrong, but... He may not be honest about why he gave me the gift, and there might be clues in their conversation!”

No, I highly doubt there'd be any clues in his conversation with Enoshima, who seems completely unrelated…

“Let's keep tailing him!”

“If that will satisfy you, Mii-chan, then I have no objections. Let's move from this side.”

While Koenji was chatting with Enoshima, he probably wasn't paying attention to his surroundings. 

But if we entered his line of sight, we couldn't be sure that he wouldn't notice us. 

Mii-chan and I made a strategic exit from the mall through a side door and aimed to re-enter from the opposite side. 

Although it took several minutes to circle around, Koenji had just bought a drink, implying that he'd stay for a while.

However—

As we entered the mall and approached the cafe, Koenji was nowhere in sight, leaving only Enoshima engrossed in her phone.

“Could he be in the restroom?”

“...No. Koenji's drink is missing. That's unlikely. He must have wrapped up his discussion with Enoshima and left in that brief window.”

“So... Does that mean we won't be able to meet him today?”

“That's what I assumed, but there's no need to rush.”

We spotted Koenji, confidently retracing his steps.

“Koenji-kun!”

“Oh? Wang girl and Ayanokoji boy. Have you come to chase after me again? It's tough being popular. Hahaha.”

A big misunderstanding, but it seems Koenji has finished his business.

“Do you have a moment?”

Without time to stumble over words due to the urgency, Mii-chan smoothly initiated the conversation.

His drink isn't with him. Did he finish it right away?

“Of course. My personal matters wrapped up quicker than expected.”

He had just concluded a brief meeting with Enoshima. I couldn't even begin to speculate on what they discussed.

“Was it you, Koenji-kun... who left items from the convenience store in front of my door while I was absent from school...?”

The long-awaited benefactor. 

She was seeking to uncover the motive behind his actions. 

Would Koenji admit to it honestly? Would he appear surprised and bewildered? Or would he deny it—

“It was indeed me who left those items for you, but why does it matter?”

Koenji confidently affirmed without a trace of hesitation or deception. A very Koenji-like response, truly unexpected.

“Um, why... did you...?”

“Why? When someone is in need, I lend a hand. Aren't you the same type of person?”

“…Eh?”

Caught off guard by his rational response, Mii-chan found herself at a loss for words.

“If that satisfies your inquiry, then I suggest you leave now?”

Mii-chan appeared uncertain how to respond to his statement.

“Wait a moment. While it may not be my place, there's something that's been bothering me. While it's natural to assist someone in need, from what I've observed, you're not one to offer help to just anyone. Yet, you've consistently helped Mii-chan. This pattern suggests there's a specific reason behind your actions.”

In a probing manner, and with subtle expressions, I attempted to prompt him.

“You certainly have a knack for choosing your words, Ayanokoji boy. You won't let me off the hook by suggesting it was a spontaneous gesture. I didn't assist Wang girl on a whim. I abhor insincerity. However, that doesn't mean I disregard acts of kindness. When I feel a genuine debt, I see it as only natural to repay it. That's all.”

Despite Koenji's attempt to sound nonchalant, Mii-chan remained visibly perplexed. 

She was still frozen in place. 

One thing was clear—he didn't appear to harbour any unexpected romantic feelings for her.

“Is there anything else, or are we finished here?”

With those words from Koenji, time finally resumed for Mii-chan, who had been momentarily frozen.

“I... I can't recall ever doing anything for you. I don't believe you owe me anything. From what you've mentioned, it sounds like I've helped you in the past…”

With a mix of apology and firmness, she sought clarification after grasping the situation. Koenji casually swept his hand through his hair.

“Hahaha!”

He chuckled brightly.

“That's precisely why it's not about hypocrisy but genuine goodwill. It's just a minor incident you need not even remember.”

In essence, this was his rationale. 

At some point, Mii-chan had assisted Koenji in some capacity. 

His subsequent acts of kindness were not driven by insincerity but by sincere goodwill. 

Hence, his consistently considerate behaviour towards Mii-chan. 

Even in her recent absence from school, he was repaying her kindness—that was the gist of it.

“I don't recall it at all... but, well, please accept this gesture for now.”

With that, she extended a paper bag containing a set of towels she had purchased as a token of gratitude.

“I have no need for this. There's no need for expressions of gratitude.”

“W-well, if you're not keen on this, I'm fine if you decline. But in that case, could I at least repay you? The expense you incurred on my behalf wasn't trivial.”

“Unfortunately, I'm not in need of money at the moment. I don't desire it.”

His response struck me as peculiar. 

To an average student, it might not raise any questions. 

It was reasonable to assume that Koenji, who amassed a fortune during the island survival test, had considerable wealth.

However, Koenji had a reputation for being extravagant. 

He had previously expressed his belief in not holding onto money for long. 

While it would be reasonable to accept his claim of saving money now, considering his recent purchase of a large TV, it was conceivable that he was still spending lavishly. 

It could potentially be a fabrication, a convenient excuse to avoid accepting points from Mii-chan.

“B-but that would pose a problem! I... I can't shake off this feeling of guilt... In that case, could you at least enlighten me on what I did for you?”

“Oh, my. You seem to have quite a complicated disposition. Didn't I mention? It's a trifling matter, one you need not dwell on. It's as simple as that. There's nothing more to discuss.”

Mii-chan seemed to have exhausted her ways for conversation with Koenji. 

With a somewhat crestfallen expression, she bowed to Koenji once more.

“May I be excused now?”

“Y-Yes.”

“I have something I'd like to discuss privately,” I interjected.

“I'm not particularly fond of attracting attention from men, but it appears you're also inclined to pry.”

“It's of importance. If you feel grateful, there's a chance you might cooperate with the class in the future, isn't there?”

“That's absurd, Ayanokoji boy. For the class to succeed, I must be valued, and any attempt to curry favour with me in exchange for something is mere pretence, don't you agree?”

He refused to acknowledge any action aimed at gaining his favour as genuine goodwill. 

It had to originate naturally.

“As long as we're bound by the school's regulations, true goodwill is unattainable. Am I mistaken?”

“Perhaps.”

“You should be well aware of this. There's no method that can turn me into an ally, no matter how hard you try.”

“That's accurate. Despite numerous attempts, I haven't discovered a foolproof method to secure your full cooperation.”

“Indeed. My stance won't change until I graduate, and even after. No amount of cunning tactics will sway my resolve. And that includes you.”

“So, what's your plan for a special exam like this one? What if Horikita decides not to protect you? We can't assume she won't renege on her promise. There might be circumstances where you can't avoid expulsion, even if you protest later.”

We could use threats or coercion to compel his cooperation.

“I've always been self-sufficient. It's that simple.”

In other words, he was confident in his ability to navigate challenges independently.

“Well, that simplifies things. I'll inform Horikita that there's no need to offer you protection.”

Having one less student to safeguard in the class provided us with an advantage. 

Naturally, I didn't anticipate Horikita betraying his trust.

“Feel free to do as you wish. Nonetheless, attempting to coerce me into compliance is futile when I have no intention of reciprocating.”

And there stood Koenji, as unyielding as a fixture, impervious to any attempts to dislodge him.

Given the circumstances, perhaps I could capitalize on the situation by excluding Koenji.
While Koenji possessed remarkable abilities, his presence posed a dilemma.

Depending on the specifics of the special exam, Horikita might continue to face obstacles due to him.

If I were the class leader, frankly speaking, Koenji would be dispensable.

The rules of the deserted island were solely between the two, with no involvement from third parties.

One option could be to eliminate him while I had the opportunity, but…

“However.”

Koenji, who had been nonchalant until now, suddenly shifted his demeanour, his gaze piercing.

“If 'someone' attempts to marginalize me, they should brace themselves.”

Had he deciphered my thoughts? No, it must have been his uncanny intuition.

“Brace themselves? I'm curious to see what you have in mind.”

“That's part of the intrigue.”

It wouldn't be as straightforward as targeting a specific individual.

One should prepare for actions that could unsettle the class's stability.

“Are you ready to unveil that plan? Although, it might prompt you to reevaluate yourself.”

“I, for one, have no intention of doing so. Horikita is the class leader.”

“Very well. I have dates to attend after this, so I'll take my leave.”

I couldn't comprehend why he chose to reference his dates in such an unconventional manner, but it seemed unlikely that I would engage in further conversation with Koenji anytime soon.

I had been closely observing Koenji in our class for quite some time. He truly was a mystery.

Though dealing with him posed its challenges, it was an undeniable truth that we needed to secure victory even with him in tow.

“Uh, um... Ayanokoji-kun.”

“I apologize. I just intended to inquire about something he mentioned that struck me as unusual, and I got a bit carried away.”

I offered a slight apology to Mii-chan, whom I had momentarily left behind.

“That's alright, but...”

“What's on your mind?”

“Oh, it's nothing.”

Indeed, my tone with Koenji had been somewhat threatening. It seemed to have left Mii-chan slightly unsettled.
