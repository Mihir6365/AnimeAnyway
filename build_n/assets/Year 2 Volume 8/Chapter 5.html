    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.1664s55"><span class="c26">Intro</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The morning of the fourth day of the school trip. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tomorrow it will be time to go back to school. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since this is the second time we are completely free, I want to make it a day
            with no
            regrets. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yesterday&#39;s spot tour apparently resulted in 10 groups, or one-half of the
            total
            20 groups, earning 20 or more points, all of whom earned 30,000 private points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, the members of the 15th group, to which Mii-chan and Miyamoto
            belonged,
            were disqualified because of time, so it seems that they will be taking a study session at the
            ryokan
            today.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I felt a little sad, but I can&#39;t help them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as the study session is over, I hope that they will soak in the hot
            springs
            and enjoy their trip as much as possible. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since it was now time for the large bath to be cleaned, I quickly finished
            changing
            my clothes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Like yesterday, I thought about watching TV, but today, Kitou is facing the
            screen,
            having come here before me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know the details, but it seems to be a fashion feature that concerns
            Kitou. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, Ayanokoji. We&#39;re going to have a snowball fight
            outside.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Snowball fight?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Watanabe, who had also finished changing, showed me his phone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that people are now gathering to have snowball fights that anyone can
            join
            in on. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That sounds interesting, let&#39;s go check it out.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ryuen, Kitou, what about you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kitou was too absorbed with the TV to give a reply, and Ryuen quickly headed for
            his
            usual seat, making his answer clear.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s go, then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the room is left both water and oil, but I&#39;ll trust their consciences
            here.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When Watanabe and I went outside the ryokan, a large number of students had
            already
            gathered. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Good morning, Kiyotaka-kun, Watanabe-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke, who was standing near the entrance and holding his cell phone, called
            out.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s a lot of people. Was everyone so interested in a snowball
            fight?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just that simple. It&#39;s a snowball match
            where
            you bet private points. I say bet, but the only qualification to participate is to pay 1,000
            points. The
            winning team will receive the points from the losing team.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you lose, you will lose less money, and if you win, you will get money to buy
            one
            or two additional souvenirs. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With how light hearted it is, it&#39;s no surprise that everyone is so excited.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, is it okay? Even though there is a lot of space, it is still on the
            premises of the ryokan.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mhm. I&#39;ve asked, but they don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s an early hour. I
            think
            it&#39;s a big factor that it&#39;s only us students on a school trip staying here.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The rules remain the same, simple and clear; no catching, only evasion. Students
            who
            are hit by snowballs must leave the court. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, the snowball has to be of a certain size; for example, if it is in
            powder
            form and the ball scatters in the air like a shotgun shell, it doesn&#39;t count even if it
            hits.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both self-reported and referee judgements will be effective. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, not many would intentionally mislead others for the sake of a few private
            points. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How many people are participating?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We should have about 30 people so far. Will you join too,
            Ayanokoji-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, I...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought about refusing, but, a snowball fight, huh? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I do not participate this time, I may never have the opportunity to experience
            it
            again. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I want to try it out, but I don&#39;t have a team.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll assign you to the teams where we&#39;re short on
            numbers, if you&#39;ll wait a bit.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke seems to be taking care of all the troublesome things, for which I am
            very
            grateful. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In fact, that&#39;s why he may be remaining here by the entrance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Taking care of things on his own can be a difficult task, but Yousuke may
            actually
            feel more secure if he can manage everything himself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I was waiting for about 10 minutes before the deadline, Horikita, who must
            have
            heard about the snowball fight in the ryokan, also showed up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I heard about this, but I didn&#39;t realize there were so many people
            here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe you&#39;ll join us?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right... it is a school trip, after all. If you have a vacancy,
            I&#39;ll join you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems she didn&#39;t plan on joining, but I think she was impressed by how
            popular
            the event ended up being.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a match, then, Horikita.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki, who emerged from the crowd, challenged Horikita as if she was waiting.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...You were here too, Ibuki-san? Really, you&#39;re always coming out from
            everywhere. But that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s just a game, but if you want, I can give it to
            you.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not liking the answer, Ibuki clenched her fist. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It may be a game, but a loss is a loss. Don&#39;t arrange excuses for later
            like a kid, okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll return that line to you exactly as it is.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke seemed to be taking a close look at the situation of the two, and when he
            looked at his mobile phone, he showed consideration for assigning them to different teams.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It wouldn&#39;t be exciting with them on the same team. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While I was stealing a glance, I spoke to Yousuke in his ear and asked for a
            little
            favour.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Good morning, everyone.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before us, Kushida appeared along with Yamamura, Nishino, and Amikura. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;As expected, Kushida. You invited Yamamura and the others too,
            huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..? Well, yeah.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought she was going to turn to her usual smile, but Kushida replied in a
            distracted manner. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But she quickly turned back to her smile. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Nishino-san and Yamamura-san said they would wait in the room until we
            leave,
            but that would be a waste, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s the right decision.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We have spent time as a group up to this point and our relationship is improving,
            albeit gradually. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is more meaningful to spend time together, whether as participants or
            spectators.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Would you like to join?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki said so to Kushida. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hm? The snowball fight?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right. Horikita and I decided to fight.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Really? But I don&#39;t think I should. I&#39;d be sad if I hit someone
            with a
            snowball. I would feel too bad to throw them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki made a sickened gesture, as if Kushida&#39;s attitude is truly sickening.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seeing that, Horikita immediately slammed a chop into Ibuki&#39;s side. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ouch! What the hell!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re dealing with me, aren&#39;t you? If you think about extra
            things,
            you&#39;ll quickly lose.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;ll lose. I&#39;ll make sure you cry!&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had thought that the distance between Horikita and Kushida had changed
            recently,
            but it seems that Ibuki was also involved. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">These crooked three, but strangely enough, I think blowing off steam like this
            may be
            good for them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The number of participating students continued to increase and eventually became
            42
            people in 6 teams.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Four teams of seven gathered by themselves. Two teams of stragglers like me were
            formed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not in the form of tournaments, etc., it&#39;s just one match. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke, perhaps thinking of how exciting it would be, designated Ibuki and
            Horikita
            specially as the third and final match. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The first match, a team of seven boys led by Ishizaki. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">And a team of seven boys led by Sudou. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is truly a clash of men. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the start, powerful snowballs flew from left and right. After all, with a
            total of
            14 snowballs, it is difficult for everyone to avoid them all. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In about 10 seconds of that, six people disappeared from both teams. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">By the way, Ishizaki, who was excited, also left in those 10 seconds. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Sudou seems to have put his frustration at being rejected by Horikita
            into
            his snowballs, kicking out the opposing team one after another. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, Ishizaki&#39;s team included Albert, who is agile enough to avoid the
            snowballs, and he has been fighting hard, defeating two so far. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura watched the match quietly, so I tried to get a little closer. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s exciting, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She replied as she noticed my presence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her facial expression was the same as usual, but she seemed to be enjoying
            herself
            somehow. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura exhaled, breathing into her palm.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On her hand, she was not wearing the gloves that she was supposed to have bought
            again at the ski resort. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Have you forgotten your gloves again?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I tried to take off my gloves, but I was stopped by Yamamura. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just kidding. I&#39;ve brought them with
            me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, she took a pair of gloves out of her pocket. She faintly smiled. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So you make jokes too, Yamamura.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...it isn&#39;t very fitting, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Instantly, the smile disappeared, and she regretted unnecessarily speaking.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, it&#39;s fine. I feel like we&#39;ve made a little bond as a
            group.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is a change that would have been unthinkable, at least from day one. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I felt it, too. &nbsp;I was always in the shadows, so I was less likely to
            be
            noticed no matter what I did, but... Kushida-san, Nishino-san, Amikura-san. Everyone looked at
            me, and
            accepted me between them. It&#39;s thanks to the group.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without the school trip, impressions of Yamamura would remain low until
            graduation.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a memorable school trip for Yamamura, and other girls. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There must be a lot of students in other groups who are similarly shortening
            distances. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When she finished putting the gloves on her hands, Yamamura pointed them at me
            and
            spread them out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not just the girls, but the boys also. This is different from what
            I
            always had in mind.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unlike on the first day of the group, Yamamura&#39;s attitude also included
            softness.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, it was a clear change, but it was a small percentage compared to other
            students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The school trip that I thought was too long at first will also end today,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A school trip spent with members you don&#39;t like, that time must have seemed
            terribly long and slow. However, just by recognizing the others as simple members of the group,
            a change
            comes about that is hard to believe after such a short time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sure you weren&#39;t the only one who changed, Yamamura. Kitou,
            Watanabe, Amikura, and Nishino also must have changed to a greater or lesser extent after this
            experience.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The group has been in constant trouble, but, in some ways, this has spiced things
            up.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think Kitou-kun&#39;s bad words toward Ryuen-kun are decreasing, little
            by
            little.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ever since we formed the group, he&#39;s been saying that he&#39;s going to
            kill him or send him to hell, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That in itself is a lot of trouble. Well, it&#39;s not so much that those two
            have
            become friends, but rather that they have just bumped into each other so much that they have
            become numb to
            each other. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, Kitou&#39;s image changed a lot for me. Originally, I didn&#39;t think
            he
            was the type to talk at all, but when I interacted with him up close, he talked surprisingly
            well. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There may be a lot of problems with what he&#39;s saying, but... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In particular, students in the Sakayanagi and Ryuen classes are often wary of
            each
            other. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They have almost never had the opportunity to see the good parts of the other
            person
            before. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Tokitou is also very attached to Sakayanagi.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Speaking of which... it seems like they&#39;ve been talking all this time
            in
            the group.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even now, they are watching the snowball fight side by side, and they are talking
            happily about many things. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Suddenly, I looked at Yamamura from the side and saw that the joyful look she had
            just displayed had faded. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The closest words that can express that expression must be &quot;I&#39;m not
            amused.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Does she have a liking for Tokitou, or does she have something on her mind about
            Sakayanagi? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a sign that either one of them is true. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yamamura, what do you think about Sakayanagi?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I asked the question not because I want to probe, but because I am genuinely
            curious
            about the relationship. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura, who had her attention somewhere else, was startled when she heard me
            calling out to her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I was wondering how you feel when you look at the competent leader of A
            class
            from the point of view of an ally.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, I&#39;m not really sure. I&#39;ve never been close to anyone, let
            alone
            Sakayanagi-san. &rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying that, she laughed at herself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The faintness of her presence means that she has no friendly relationships.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, is she simply feeling a longing, like envying Tokitou&#39;s
            casual
            conversation? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then why don&#39;t you take this as an opportunity? You may actually become
            friends.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t have the courage to do that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What about Kitou, then? Isn&#39;t this group conduct making you two get
            closer?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh... that&#39;s, he&#39;s a boy, so...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was intended as a light joke, but Yamamura pulled back more than I expected.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry. I guess I got a bit ahead of myself.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if they do not think anything of each other, it is natural for someone to be
            sensitive when it&#39;s about a man and a woman. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t mind. You said it for me, right? Thank you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I looked at Yamamura, and looked over the students around us. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">New encounters, new friendships. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, truth and lies; those who can see through, and those who can&#39;t. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A school trip in which the exchange of checks makes for a gut-wrenching
            experience.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Which class will be the winner in the future? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I can&#39;t right now, but I&#39;ll give it some thought.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At the end, Yamamura added on and replied so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We stopped exchanging words here and turned our attention to the game. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although Albert was showing his strong arm, he did not seem to have much accuracy
            in
            hitting his targets, and the winner was ultimately decided by Sudou&#39;s agility and precise
            attacks.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As expected of Sudou, who is a top-class performer in sports under any
            circumstances.
            Horikita also gave a generous round of applause to Sudou. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At a distance, Onodera also seemed to be supporting him in her own way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Following on, is the second match. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although the competition was mixed gender, there were no students with
            outstanding
            results like Sudou and Albert, and the matches were more like an extension of play than a
            serious
            competition.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It wasn&#39;t long before it was settled, but they both had a good time, and they
            ended up celebrating the good fight.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s about time, right? Good luck.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Finally, the third match. The battle between me and Ibuki, and the Horikita team
            begins. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s do our best together, Yamamura&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I called out to her, she gave me a dazed look. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I asked Yousuke to let you enter as well.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh, huh!? I-I can&#39;t do it. Let alone being able to fight myself,
            I&#39;ll
            only hold you back.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make up for the points if you lose.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not that kind of problem..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Just being there with the right number of people is enough of an asset.
            Let&#39;s go.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I walked out, Yamamura followed after me with a little hesitation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She would gather a lot of eyes on her if it was noticed that she was alone, so
            she
            came along to avoid that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m, I&#39;m warning you, you know?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s okay. You saw the match earlier, it&#39;s just for
            fun.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But... it&#39;s not like that for some people.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll definitely win!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki, who was burning with fighting spirit, picked up some snow, clenched it,
            and
            began image training for the sequence of actions up to throwing it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[TL Note 33 : Image Training, sports term for training while imagining in your
            head.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can just leave her alone.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I instructed Yamamura to move to the very back of the line. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The students in front of her would target her, so I&#39;m trying to avoid
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;d rather have her focus on having fun for as long as possible than hitting
            someone with a snowball and knocking them down. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the match started, like the previous two matches, the fighting students in
            the
            front gathered a lot of snowballs. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the other hand, snowballs that miss or are aimed at the rear are also flying
            by,
            but if she is careful, she won&#39;t be hit. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Whoa, whoa!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without time to gather and throw snowballs, Yamamura was desperately trying to
            avoid
            them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, one of the several snowballs came at an angle to hit around
            Yamamura&#39;s
            left hip. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...ah!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to help Yamamura, I forcefully pulled her right arm to let her avoid the
            snowball. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;S-sorry, you saved me!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The numbers are starting to dwindle and the fighting in the front is
            getting
            more fierce. Let&#39;s make some snowballs now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, ah, umm... okay!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We hastily made some snowballs, which turned out a lot bigger than expected.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They don&#39;t look like they would reach, but that in itself is fun so I
            won&#39;t
            say anything. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a weak yell, a large snowball flew through the sky.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, it landed on our own side.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Now we should make one smaller and throw
            that.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Y-Yes!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura started collecting snow again in a hurry. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the meantime, the game progressed faster and faster, and a few students were
            defeated. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura, hoping to make at least one person fall, completed her second snowball,
            but
            she was so focused on throwing that she was forced to exert herself and threw it almost directly
            downwards,
            with less distance than before. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, ugh..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Three of our team&#39;s front liners have been hit, and Yamamura has begun to
            gather
            the other team&#39;s gaze. I moved away from Yamamura to draw attention to myself, and moved
            forward.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I quickly gathered snow and threw a snowball at Nakanishi, who was trying to
            target
            us. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I threw a wild snowball, but it backfired. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura also forgot to evade and looked frantically at the snow under her feet,
            which caused her to get hit on the head. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah..!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the snowball she was clutching gone from her hand too, Yamamura hurried out
            of
            the area with her hands up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She was sad, but also frustrated, and it showed on her face. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That being said, I hope she was able to experience at least a little of the
            tension
            and fun of a snowball fight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, as we repeatedly threw snowballs at each other, people were defeated
            one
            by one and it was just Horikita left on the opposite team. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On our team, it&#39;s me and Ibuki. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In light of these circumstances, this is certainly advantageous. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki stood behind me and put her arms together. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Move.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without evading, I took the ball Horikita threw with my hands. Catching is
            obviously
            not allowed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you trying to do?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ibuki is asking for a one-on-one. Our team leader is saying she&#39;ll win,
            so
            I think I should listen to her.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had little time, but I actually enjoyed the snowball match, so I don&#39;t need
            any
            more. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Forcefully defeating Horikita would not be interesting. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, I am purely interested in the confrontation between Ibuki and
            Horikita,
            whose strengths should not differ greatly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t like it a bit, but it&#39;s fine. I can now just focus on
            Ibuki-san
            too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So, good luck, Ibuki. I&#39;m betting my souvenir on you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Just shut up and get out of here. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to lose
            to
            Horikita, is there?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As the crowd watched on, the battle between Horikita and Ibuki was about to
            begin.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no rule of draw in this fight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if the referee decides that you have hit at the same time, it means that you
            will continue to fight an extended battle. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is only a snowball fight, but for both sides it is a battle they cannot lose.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s great to have a true one on one fight, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The snowball fight was held with gloves, but at this point Ibuki took off her
            gloves
            and clutched the snowball in her right hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It must be a strategy to throw away the cold resistance but increase the accuracy
            of
            the delivery. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita was afraid of losing control of her fingertips due to the cold, so she
            looks
            like she will fight without removing her gloves. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With this, Ibuki has the advantage in case of a short term battle, while Horikita
            will have the advantage in a long term battle. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry, I was completely useless.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yamamura muttered as she moved her shoulders up and down, perhaps still a little
            out
            of breath. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s fine. Did you have some fun, at least?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes... I wanted to hit someone if I could.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, Yamamura only slightly raised the corners of her mouth. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She won&#39;t be able to fight in the snowball match with the same people, but
            there
            will be other chances for her to fight in some kind of competition.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I hope she will save her regrets until then and take her revenge.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Back in the gallery, we turned our attention to the two women facing each other
            one-on-one. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A serious match.. huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki wanted to settle the match in the short term, but Horikita saw through that
            and
            prioritized evasion over attack. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No stopping!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki began to be impatient as she gradually became frustrated and the coldness
            of
            her fingertips began to get worse. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As the battle began to drag on, Ibuki&#39;s eighth snowball aimed at Horikita
            grazed
            her near the cheek.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 8/images/image13.webp" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Come on, give me the win!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ibuki&#39;s strong fast-ball struck Horikita again despite her tiredness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as she evaded it, she released a snowball, which she had been holding for
            a
            while, as if it were a counter. But, Ibuki is strong. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She was tired, but still alert, and looked for an opportunity even as she lost
            her
            posture. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like you&#39;re at your limits too, so how about we end it
            here?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita, on the other hand, does not seem to want to fight for any longer and
            seems
            to be shifting to an attacking stance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, both of them were ready to give it everything they had. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A long one-on-one fight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The snowball from Horikita that was heading toward Ibuki was scattered in the
            air.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I guess it lost its momentum because of her soft grip. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Therefore, it hit Ibuki in the form of splashes of fragments. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita, on the other hand, tried to avoid a snowball flying from Ibuki just in
            time, but was unable to avoid it completely and it grazed the fabric on her left arm. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It did hit, but she also avoided it at the same time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a subtle judgement. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, Yousuke, who did not welcome any further delay, made a judgement
            call.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Horikita-san hit! Ibuki-san&#39;s victory!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With an intense triumphant pose, Ibuki smiled. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita was trying to act calmly, as this was only a snowball match, but her
            regrets
            seemed to be oozing out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Come on, loser! Please give me the 1000 points right away!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 34 - This is the word used in jp: &#36000;&#12369;&#29356; Makeinu,

            but I suppose that phrase isn&#39;t really used in english like this, it will work with just
            &quot;loser&quot; too.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without paying attention to her hand trembling from the cold, Ibuki took out her
            cell
            phone and stuck it up to Horikita. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s very annoying... You don&#39;t have to talk like that, I&#39;ll
            hand
            them over.&quot;</span></p>

            on!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Are they getting along or fighting? For a while, Ibuki continued to frolic and
            get
            carried away around Horikita. </span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On this day, we enjoyed skiing one last time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This time, all eight of us skied through a gentle course for beginners, rather
            than
            separating.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ryuen seemed bored all the time, but I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t act selfishly by
            himself. </span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After that, I bought souvenirs for the first-year students in the remaining
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the fourth day of such a fun school trip, all we have left is tonight. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After I finished bathing in the large bathroom, I received a message from
            Sakayanagi.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I responded to her request to meet with her and headed to the lobby where we
            planned
            to meet. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s only around 8:00 pm, but there are much fewer students around today.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On this last night, there should be a lot to talk about in the viking and in the
            room.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">[TL Note 35 : He says &quot;viking&quot; here to mean buffet again like I

            &quot;viking&quot; in the original so I left it like that.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps because they quickly realized this situation, I don&#39;t see many
            students
            in the lobby.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a favorable situation in place, Sakayanagi sat quietly in her chair and

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even though there aren&#39;t many people around, the combination of me and
            Sakayanagi
            is a little conspicuous. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In that sense, I&#39;d like to do this quickly, but...</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was a short time, but did you enjoy your school trip?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right. I was taught many things that I had never experienced
            before.
            Above all, it was frankly a good experience to be able to interact with students from other
            classes. I think
            I know a little more about Yamamura and Kitou now.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I mentioned both names here, but Sakayanagi looks the same as usual. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. &nbsp;I&#39;m not particularly surprised, since you have a voracious
            appetite for absorbing knowledge.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you get along with those two?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ll try to step in a little further by asking so. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t have any classmates that I consider special. I see them all
            with
            equal eyes. It doesn&#39;t matter whether we get along, or whether we don&#39;t, you
            know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether it was a lie or a truth, Sakayanagi replied vaguely. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Specializing someone can cause jealousy and other feelings among the other
            students.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As a leader, Sakayanagi may be seeing things equally without lying. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can I ask why you called me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are we done with the small talk now? Perhaps you&#39;re in a hurry? If
            Karuizawa Kei-san saw you here like this, she would be suspicious about us, right?&quot; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She said so while laughing like a little devil. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s not good to be seen meeting with an A-class delegate one-on-one.
            Right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He-he, it&#39;s a joke. I get it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After smiling with restraint, Sakayanagi started speaking. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I learned a lot during this school trip. Before we go back to school, I
            thought
            I would talk to you about the person who approached you at the sports festival,
            Ayanokoji-kun.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The time when we were talking in my room, absent from the sports festival along
            with
            Sakayanagi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">About the man who spoke out from the front door, is it..? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. I am interested in that story.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s good. So you were also interested in the identity of that
            voice.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it a lot.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With what I sensed in Nanase also in mind, it&#39;s still unclear whether the
            caller
            is an enemy or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So, I&#39;ll ask you, but what kind of person do you think he is? Is it
            possible that he comes from the same background as you, like Amasawa Ichika-san or Yagami
            Takuya-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;-No, I don&#39;t think so. If the other party only knew Sakayanagi, that
            could
            be possible, but he called my father &quot;Ayanokoji-sensei&quot;. This is a big
            difference.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If he was a White Room student, he wouldn&#39;t have called him
            &quot;Ayanokoji-sensei&quot;, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is common to those who grew up in the White Room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But that&#39;s not an absolute proof, is it? If he is from a different
            generation than you, Ayanokoji-kun, then the policies may be different, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s true, I can&#39;t be sure. It was just my own opinion that made me
            feel this way. One big reason is that the man called last year, when my father was visiting this
            school. So,
            one can assume that they are related. Further, you yourself said that it was someone close to
            the politics
            and business world, yes?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It goes back to the fact that he went out of his way to call him sensei.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a little surprise, Sakayanagi nodded with joy, her eyes closed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That is right. The advice and such may have been unnecessary. I already
            have
            eyes on the owner of that voice, his identity, but I haven&#39;t confirmed the truth yet. I was
            going to
            make that clear here today. That&#39;s why I called you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I turned my attention to the cell phone that Sakayanagi had placed at her lap.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, before I make everything clear, I&#39;m calling here someone who
            should
            know him. They said that they will be here soon.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In other words, among the second years, there is a student who has a
            connection
            with that man?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It seems that no candidates come up in your head, but is that
            true?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s correct. I have no idea who she is referring to. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, the owner of the voice is living his school life as a first year, so
            it
            would not be strange for someone from the second year to know him, but I don&#39;t think
            that&#39;s what
            this is. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no reason to call them here unless they at least know more about the
            situation on our side. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Is there a second year student, other than Sakayanagi, who knows about the White
            Room, and my father&#39;s identity?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the meantime, let&#39;s keep this conversation going.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That sounds like a good idea.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Spending time in silence is not a clever way to spend school trips. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How did you feel about the group divisions this time,
            Ayanokoji-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The influence of the chart filled by individual students must have a great
            effect. As far as I could see, I felt that the adjustment was not just about one&#39;s own
            group, but also
            the students who gave extreme assessments.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I agree. The students rated the best, and the students rated the worst. And
            an
            intermediate layer that doesn&#39;t belong to either. It will not apply to all groups, but I
            think there was
            definitely a bias. It must have been a combination that could easily affect the
            future.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Following that, I want to ask you something.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that. Ask me anything you want to know.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you think about the final test?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The groupings for this school trip will surely have an impact later on. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi closed her eyes happily and shook her head vertically with
            satisfaction
            two or three times. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s really fun to talk to you, Ayanokoji-kun. You always have the same
            idea. The final test is going to be tougher than last year.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">One or two expulsions wouldn&#39;t be a surprise. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It looks like Sakayanagi is making such a prediction. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You, with your protected points, will be safe, but the class points you
            lose
            anyway will remain the same. Aren&#39;t you worried that your large lead will be
            destroyed?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You think I&#39;ll lose in a direct confrontation with Ryuen-kun? Beating
            him
            is already the established policy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Like Ryuen, Sakayanagi does not even imagine that she will be defeated. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It is true that he makes interesting moves. He is almost like what they
            call a
            &quot;giant killer&quot;, with the power to hunt down the big names in particular. But, that
            won&#39;t
            happen in a confrontation with me. Ayanokoji-kun, you can be sure that I&#39;ll be the one
            competing with
            your class next year.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unwavering confidence. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There are cases of eventual draws, but that may be considered an exception.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t think that the school will create rules that make it easy for
            students to
            draw at the end of the school year. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That is what I saw from last year&#39;s fight with A class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Or do you think I&#39;ll lose?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Who knows?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can&#39;t say anything at the stage where I can&#39;t see the contents of the
            test.
            But if I tell her that, Sakayanagi will feel even more reluctant. Depending on the content, the
            implication
            would be that Sakayanagi may lose. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter who wins or loses...</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ayanokoji-kun, for you, is there no hindrance whether I win or he
            wins?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because our thoughts are linked, Sakayanagi also understands my thoughts well.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, Ayanokoji-kun. The future may not always be the way you want it to
            be.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just as I asked back, Sakayanagi put her index finger over her mouth. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apparently, the expected visitor had arrived. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps not having being told that I would be here, Kanzaki stood besides me with
            some surprise. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, I didn&#39;t expect him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ve never had the impression of him having a special connection to the past
            in
            all the years we&#39;ve been in contact. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;With this, all the necessary people are here, so let&#39;s start. Sorry,
            but
            could you come over here, Kanzaki-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What the hell is this, Sakayanagi?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi, with a smile, let Kanzaki, who doesn&#39;t understand, stand beside
            herself. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Crossing his arms with suspicion, Kanzaki still doesn&#39;t seem to have grasped
            the
            situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was the same for me, so I wondered if this arrangement had some meaning.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;First of all, Ayanokoji-kun. What do you think of the combination of me and
            Kanzaki-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span><img alt="" src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 8/images/image15.webp" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do I think?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell me your honest thoughts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I just feel uncomfortable. I&#39;ve never seen you and Kanzaki together
            before.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When they are actually lined up like this, that is very clear. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll bet. For the students of this school, Kanzaki-kun and I have no
            point
            of contact. We are not even on the same level as fellow leaders, and I doubt that any of you
            have seen us
            socialize in private. In fact, I have hardly spoken to Kanzaki-kun since I enrolled in this
            school.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, she wants to say that they talked before enrolling in the school.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How many years have I been talking to you like this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know. It must have been at least three or four years since I
            contacted you directly.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that they don&#39;t even clearly remember the time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can I ask you what kind of acquaintance you are?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a connection between parents. However, there is still no direct
            connection between the Sakayanagi and Kanzaki families. When you have parents who are well-known
            in their
            own right, you get invited to a lot of parties and things like that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no doubt that Sakayanagi&#39;s father is the president of this school,
            and
            that they are a well-known family by virtue of knowing the White Room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kanzaki-kun&#39;s father is the representative of a company called Kanzaki
            Engineering.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the thing these two have in common, &nbsp;it&#39;s being in the same framework
            of
            business leaders. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That would explain why I have no suspicions about Kanzaki. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What the hell are you talking about? What&#39;s the point of letting
            Ayanokoji
            hear about this? No, let me ask you why you called me before that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This actually has something to do with why I called you here.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know what that means.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I was hoping you could tell me more about Ishigami-kun who is enrolled at
            our
            school.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With that, Kanzaki&#39;s expression became even more intense. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;About Ishigami, you say..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ishigami? There are no names that come to mind among the second years, and the
            only
            student whose last name corresponds is a first year. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I see. You were interested in Ishigami too?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can take it that way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But, why Ayanokoji? They have no point of contact, do they? I don&#39;t
            think
            that man would meaninglessly concern himself with other grades. If he did, it would only be when
            there is
            some kind of trouble. It&#39;s hard to imagine Ryuen, or even Ayanokoji wasting his time in such
            a
            way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He&#39;s analyzing and describing the situation in his own way. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Not now, but in the past.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Still don&#39;t understand? You should also have deep feelings for the name
            Ayanokoji.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you mean... no...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As he noticed something, Kanzaki repeatedly looked at Sakayanagi and me. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re so late to notice. Of course, that is to be expected, too
            but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I see what it is.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that Kanzaki understood Sakayanagi&#39;s words. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he looked up at the ceiling holding his head, and looked at me again.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ayanokoji, huh..? I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re that person&#39;s
            child.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&#39;s only one thing I can gather from these words. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That Kanzaki must also have some idea of or acquaintance with the person named
            Ayanokoji. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">And it is no longer necessary to guess that it is my father. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That man has a strong connection with the wealthy. It was inevitable. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you still feel uncomfortable that I am with Ayanokoji-kun
            here?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah. &nbsp;I thought you were simply interested in Ayanokoji&#39;s
            ability,
            but I guess that wasn&#39;t it. Since when did you know he was Ayanokoji-sensei
            child?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, from the moment I saw him at this school. Unlike you,
            Kanzaki-kun,
            I&#39;ve seen Ayanokoji-kun when he was little. Right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She won&#39;t mention White Room, but she replied as if we were childhood
            friends.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So he&#39;s not just anybody. If he is that person&#39;s son... He must be
            superior.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kanzaki turned his eyes to me, as if he was now understood. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;My father adored Ayanokoji-sensei, and I have met him in person several
            times
            at parties. I&#39;ve only spoken to him once, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With even an indirect relation to Chairman Sakayanagi, it&#39;s no wonder that
            this
            kind of thing can happen.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even so, he seems to have a lot of respect for that man. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since I do not know his private life at all, I cannot imagine what kind of
            response
            he gave in front of Kanzaki, but I cannot deny that there is a gap in perception. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;My assessment of you has been changing again and again, but it&#39;s
            finally
            settled. If there is a child of Ayanokoji-sensei in Horikita&#39;s class, then I&#39;m sure they
            will be
            formidable.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He seems to have a high opinion of my father, and has happily convinced
            himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Now then. We were able to correct the misunderstanding, so let&#39;s move
            on.
            Ayanokoji-kun, you don&#39;t know about Ishigami-kun, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard of him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that the student named Ishigami is the one who contacted us. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;He is one of the young men who adore your father. You know Kanzaki-kun
            well,
            don&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Yeah. He seems to be infatuated with Ayanokoji-sensei. I didn&#39;t have
            the
            courage to so easily talk with him, but Ishigami was different. I don&#39;t know for how long,
            but he&#39;s
            really been actively talking with him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ishigami-kun is one year younger than us, and now he is living his student
            life
            as a first-year student.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A man who adores that man has entered this school, and for some reason, he has
            contacted me several times and even indirectly helped eliminate Yagami at the school festival.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The purpose of the man named Ishigami is still not clear. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve had a chance to interact with first-year students,
            but
            when did you notice Ishigami first?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I noticed him right away when I saw the OAA. However, he is not the type to
            come out into the public, so I didn&#39;t have a chance to speak. He communicated with Class A
            through
            Takahashi-kun, and he seemed to be intentionally avoiding contact with me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi herself didn&#39;t seem to want to force contact. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is he excellent?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c32">[TL Note 36 - &#20778;&#21155; Yuuretsu (relative) merits; superiority or
            inferiority; quality, translated as &quot;excellent&quot; since I thought that would sound most
            natural.]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sure Kanzaki-kun, who is close to him, knows more about that than I
            do.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kanzaki was entrusted with explaining the situation, but he did not look happy at
            all. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Quite the opposite. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re not close. I just went to the same cram school as Ishigami. But
            to
            answer Ayanokoji&#39;s question honestly, he is undeniably a genius. He&#39;s got a lot of ideas
            that I
            couldn&#39;t think of, and I&#39;ve seen them up close.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He didn&#39;t seem to like Ishigami, but he replied to admit the fact. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right. Kanzaki-kun&#39;s point of view, although it is only an
            idea,
            I thought it might be helpful.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But so what? Now all we have to do is just leave Ishigami
            alone.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can you imagine? He respects your father, Ayanokoji-kun. If so, it would
            not be
            surprising if he enrolled in this school to check his son&#39;s ability.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Keeping information about the White Room hidden, Sakayanagi successfully guides
            the
            conversation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ishigami came here to confirm Ayanokoji&#39;s ability..? I can&#39;t say
            that
            it&#39;s impossible.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Comparing to the Ishigami that he knew, it seems like he is convinced to some
            extent.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re competing in year two. Even if your class is one step behind,
            Kanzaki-kun, it is still unclear what the outcome will be. In such a situation, don&#39;t you
            think it&#39;s
            unfair that Ishigami-kun would use unnecessary tricks to find out about Ayanokoji-kun ability
            from now
            on?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t understand what you mean. But, why are you
            supporting Ayanokoji? It doesn&#39;t matter what happens to the students in your rival
            class.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If left alone, Ishigami will hinder one of the students in her rival class. It is
            clear to everyone that this is inherently a plus for Sakayanagi. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I just want to have fun. It is my role to bury Horikita-san&#39;s class,
            including him. Isn&#39;t it frustrating for someone to suddenly appear from the side and deprive
            you of
            purpose?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After laughing, Sakayanagi expressed her gratitude to Kanzaki</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you, Kanzaki-kun. From here on, Ayanokoji-kun and I will work out a
            plan
            to deal with Ishigami-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was gratitude, but... the implication that those who stand in the way should
            leave
            was also strongly included.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not going to get involved with Ishigami, so I&#39;m grateful for
            that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kanzaki answered without hesitation and started walking. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s talk again soon, Ayanokoji. I want you to tell me a lot about
            him.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He is eager to talk about my father, but unfortunately I know nothing about him.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For the time being, it would be safe to nod lightly here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, Ayanokoji-kun. Let&#39;s see if Ishigami-kun is really the right
            answer.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course, I&#39;ll ask him directly. That&#39;s the fastest, isn&#39;t
            it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi pulled out her cell phone and smoothly typed in the 11 digit number.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that she had done her homework, and had already obtained Ishigami&#39;s
            phone number. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sakayanagi made a call on the speaker, and soon after, the call began. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought it was about time I got the call. Sakayanagi.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as he answered the phone, Ishigami spoke in a tone as if he had foreseen
            it.
            This voice is unmistakably the person who called me last year and the person who contacted me at
            the sports
            festival. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re very quick to see things, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If someone asked for my number except a year one student, I told them in
            advance to report it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Just what I would expect from you. I&#39;ve heard rumors about you from
            inside
            and out.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He had eyes everywhere, and, like a spider, he had laid down his web; a web of
            information.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it have been better if you had called out to me
            sooner?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I deliberately avoided contact. You don&#39;t have to get involved with me
            either, do you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It doesn&#39;t work that way. I thought it was important to confirm whether
            or
            not you would stand in Ayanokoji-kun&#39;s way in the future.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then I&#39;ll ask you, but what are you going to do if I will?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t expect Ayanokoji-kun to be defeated by someone who is not me,
            but I
            don&#39;t like to be sidetracked. If you&#39;re going to intervene, I might have to stop
            you.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You will stop me? You should ignore me instead of wasting your time like
            that.
            I chose this school on the recommendation of Ayanokoji-sensei. To be a normal
            student.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He came to this school with a similar idea. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It is safe to assume that for now, there is no possibility of eliminating
            Ayanokoji from this school at this time.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;For now? It&#39;s a word that bothers me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In the unlikely event that Ayanokoji-sensei instructs me to remove him, I
            will
            do so. That&#39;s it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">His tone of voice, always calm, does not seem to be laden with lies. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;ve become quite loyal in a short time, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t go any further, Sakayanagi. &nbsp;Even more so if you want to be
            by
            Ayanokoji&#39;s side.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The only sure thing is that he is warning her it will not end lightly. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not going to tell you to hide me. Sooner or later Ayanokoji will
            find
            out about my existence. So you advise him. What is the best option to protect this school life?
            No, if
            he&#39;s listening to the call right now, you don&#39;t have to.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no proof. But he is considering the possibility that I am eavesdropping.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll let him know when I feel like it. &nbsp;I&#39;d be happy to say
            hello
            to you at school sometime.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At this point, Sakayanagi decided enough was enough and ended the call from her
            side..</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It was him, after all. Well, he didn&#39;t seem like he wanted to hide it,
            anyway.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s what it looks like. If he came to this school to enjoy student
            life
            to the fullest, I have no intention of being involved with him in the future.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At least in my interactions with Ishigami that I have felt so far, I have never
            sensed any danger, and the same is true of my current phone call. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now that there is a possibility that my father was not trying to expel me from
            the
            beginning, there is no need to panic. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. If you choose to do so, then I will respect it,
            Ayanokoji-kun.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m grateful. Thanks to you, I was able to confirm the existence of
            Ishigami.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Now that we have some sense of direction, I wouldn&#39;t want to keep you
            here
            for too long. But do you mind if I continue with what I was talking about just now?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The future won&#39;t always be the way I want it to be, right?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was certainly curious about Sakayanagi&#39;s way of saying that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, Ayanokoji-kun!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, just as she was about to continue the same conversation, we were
            approached. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Umm, did you see Honami-chan?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amikura, who was walking quickly down the corridor looking a little flustered,
            called
            out to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, I didn&#39;t see her. Did something happen to Ichinose?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Look, the school trip is already over, isn&#39;t it? So we decided to get
            together and chat until the lights went out, but we couldn&#39;t find Honami-chan.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A considerable number of people were searching, and while talking like this, a
            girl
            from D class hurriedly walked away next to Amikura.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like they&#39;ve checked the bath and the room.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I heard she looked a little depressed this evening... and I was a little
            worried.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After Amikura&#39;s worried voice, a girl from the same class came to talk to
            her.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Mako-chan. I just had it checked, and it looks like Honami-chan&#39;s
            yukata is
            here, so she might be outside.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Uh, outside? But it&#39;s almost 9 o&#39;clock, right? Besides, the people
            in
            the group are at the ryokan, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We are allowed to go out until 9 pm, but if we are going out alone, it will be a
            problem. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll check out the public bath one more time!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not wanting to waste any more time standing and talking, Amikura asked first and
            started walking. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s true that Ichinose&#39;s absence at this hour is a bit worrying. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s talk about this again next time. Please search for Ichinose-san.
            For
            you, Ayanokoji-kun, Ichinose-san&#39;s presence is probably still indispensable.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I said goodbye to Sakayanagi, and I left the lobby behind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We are not allowed to act alone outside of a group, and Ichinose is not a student
            who
            breaks the school&#39;s designated rules for no good reason. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if there were troubles, her basic stance would not change. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I looked out the hallway of the ryokan and saw that the snow was pouring down.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she is really out of the inn, there are only so many places she can go.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After returning to my room and putting on my personal clothes, I slipped out of
            the
            backyard of the ryokan and headed outside. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Beyond this point, there is a high plateau from which to view the illuminated
            landscape. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is exactly where it gets locked down at 9pm, which is the curfew. With the
            backyard which is in the ryokan borders, it is not necessary to meet the requirements for group
            conduct.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if the ground is bright with lighting, it is dangerous because of the snow.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Many of the students climbed to the higher ground on their first or second day at
            the
            ryokan. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Therefore, few students are likely to go back to see it again under the cold,
            snowy
            weather. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not to mention it is the last day. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They&#39;d want to spend a relaxing time at the inn. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
