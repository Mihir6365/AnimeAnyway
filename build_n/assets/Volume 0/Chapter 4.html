    <h3 class="c1" id="h.3as4poj"><span class="c9">Intro</span></h3>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When Mika saw the pile of cash on the white table, she couldn&#39;t help but let out
            a sigh of admiration.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;The amount is 50 million, I have arranged it in cash form as per your request,
            and it will not leave any traceable evidence.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I spoke to Mika while avoiding direct eye contact.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The 50 million does not cover any expenses associated with the pregnancy, including
            delivery and hospitalization.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Politicians really do have free reign over money and everything else, huh? Was
            it easy for you to get 50 million?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika said sarcastically, dressed in a suit she was probably not accustomed to
            wearing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Money is important, but I can provide as much money as you need to live.
            That&#39;s the world I live in.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I detachedly spoke in a robot-like way, Mika laughed at me, as if fed up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The fact that your child will be born does not affect your heart at all,
            huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then, are you going to tell me that you&#39;ve awakened to motherhood
            now?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No way. If that were the case, I would not have given the child away. For me,
            the whole process of having and giving birth to that child is work, nothing more, nothing
            less.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was relieved to hear that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could see in her eyes that this wasn&rsquo;t Mika&rsquo;s bluff, but that she was
            telling the truth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess I made the right choice picking you after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I almost regretted it when my belly started to grow and the morning sickness
            started to get worse. I came here thinking I would complain or something, but when I saw all this money in
            front of me, I didn&#39;t care anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even for Mika, who had been receiving a monthly salary of well over a million, it
            seems a lump sum of 50 million was a different story. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wouldn&rsquo;t want to hear any complaints in the first place, anyway. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The money I paid for her to give birth and the other expenses were more than double
            the market rate, even if I estimated them highly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Normally, I would have to pay almost half of this amount to the
            government.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;That&#39;s right, you have to earn 100 million to save 50 million, don&#39;t
            you? I can&#39;t help but think you&#39;re crazy if you have to pay almost half of this in
            taxes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika tiredly laughed a little as she touched the surface of the roll of
            banknotes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Have you ever properly paid taxes?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is said that many people in a profession such as Mika&#39;s do not pay
            taxes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now that you say it, I can&rsquo;t really remember. Well, I will start a new
            job now, so maybe I will, so I guess it&rsquo;s fine. More importantly, how have you been recently? Is
            everything the same?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, but I&rsquo;m busy and I don&rsquo;t want to have a long talk.
            Let&rsquo;s just do what we have to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I took out the contract and held it out in front of Mika.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you want the money, write it down. You have the rights of the child until
            you sign here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You worry too much. Don&#39;t worry, I only had the baby for the money. I have
            no hesitation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika had no intention of refusing the money, and she reiterated her willingness to
            accept it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No matter what, you will not be allowed to identify yourself as the mother in
            the future for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This may sound like an insistent statement, but it is extremely important.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I cannot deny the possibility that the White Room would be exposed if Mika, who is
            well versed in the underworld, were to publicly try to get her child back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know. Don&rsquo;t talk about me to that kid either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no need to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Can you just tell me what&#39;s going to happen to him?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I haven&rsquo;t told Mika anything relating to White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So it&rsquo;s understandable that she&rsquo;s curious about the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason for you to know that. Once the contract is signed,
            your relationship will be severed, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right, right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if understanding there was no point in further continuing, Mika started signing
            the contract.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All good?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Judging by the strength of her writing, there was no hesitation at all until the very
            end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure there will be no apprehensions left after emphasizing things this
            far.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I gave instructions and had the attach&eacute; case containing the money put into the
            trunk of Mika&rsquo;s car.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a bit risky to carry such a large sum of money in cash, but both Mika and I
            agreed to avoid transferring the money via banks and such.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This would be the last time I would see Mika, and the last time I would speak to
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was about to silently walk away, Mika took a few steps and then stopped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Aren&rsquo;t you going to ask? What will I do with this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was impossible to read the expression on her face. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I could detect that there was a hint of emotion in her voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m not interested. You are free to go to that host or fly abroad with the
            money.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She was slightly surprised, but then understood and laughed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You knew? You knew about me and him?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have to investigate, the people around did that on their
            own.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How long have you known?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Before I asked you to marry me and have a baby.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you suspect that this was brood parasitism?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">[ TL Note 8 : brood parasitism : (planting one&#39;s eggs in another bird&#39;s nest,
            as demonstrated by the cuckoo, etc.) ]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, as if she was messing with me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of before doubt. You would have predicted that I would
            do a postnatal exam. And if by any chance you were carrying someone else&#39;s child, you&#39;d lose your
            reward. It&#39;s an impossible choice.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hehe, indeed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;But you restrained yourself well. I must commend you for keeping your secret
            meetings with him to a minimum during our married life, and for being as discreet as possible to avoid
            detection.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am unsure if that host really wants to make Mika happy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the very least, Mika&#39;s fortune should be over 200 million, including this 50
            million.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Maybe 5, or 10 years? Until the money runs out, she will have happy days with the
            host.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Atsuomi&hellip; Did you love me, even once?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You will do anything for money. That&rsquo;s the most valuable thing about
            you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&rdquo;That wasn&#39;t really my point... No, I&#39;m sure you have nothing else to
            say.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve never had any special feelings towards Mika.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">And, at the same time, this woman does not even have a lingering affection towards
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All the words here that seem to invite sympathy are an act to make her look
            good.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She likes young, good-looking, good-talking men, and above all, she values herself
            and money.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is the woman called Mika.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Farewell, Atsuomi.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait. This is the congratulatory money from me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">3 million on top of the fee I had originally prepared for her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I handed over the money to Mika, including the congratulatory gift, which might also
            be considered consolation money.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&#39;t have to go that far. I wouldn&#39;t have sold this to a weekly
            magazine. I have done many black-hearted things with you too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika has a lot of things in her life that she doesn&#39;t want to be revealed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right. That&#39;s why this is a pure celebration money
            without any back and forth. If you don&#39;t need it, don&#39;t force yourself to take it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I reached out to pull up the money, Mika stopped my hand with a laugh.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have to have money to build my own home. I heard that land is getting more
            expensive these days, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&#39;t even know the underlying reason why land prices are going up, do
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know. As long as I have my money, I don&rsquo;t care,
            so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you. I&rsquo;m sure you know, but it will be some time
            before you can officially marry someone else.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because the plan is for me to go back to the country while I&#39;m still your
            wife, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Until a while after I put the kid in White Room, we have to keep the marriage in
            place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It won&#39;t be that long. If you wait two more years, you can do whatever you
            want after that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For that, I&#39;ve already given Mika the divorce papers, complete except for the
            dates for me and her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;One last thing. If you&#39;ve decided on a name, I&#39;ll file under that
            name.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Since eleven days have already passed since the birth, there are three days remaining
            unless additional steps are taken.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re letting me decide, even though I have no right to the
            child?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The name is just a symbol. No matter who gives it to him, his substance as a
            human being will never change.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After a short pause, Mika uttered the child&#39;s name.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then, Kiyotaka. Make it Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like you to suggest that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was a little surprised at this unexpected turn of events.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s going to be remembered by you, I thought this would be the
            name.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll accept it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You really are a very calm, and cool-headed person. This would make an
            ordinary person angry, right? It&#39;s the right answer to name him after the host I like... isn&#39;t
            it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika started to walk away. This time, her legs did not stop.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Farewell, Atsuomi. The time I had with you was a very important experience for
            me. Both good and bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After Mika left, I wrote down &ldquo;Kiyotaka&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She shouldn&rsquo;t have any complaints after I let her have that much money.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the representative managing White Room, I put my child out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I can establish that track record, I can say that the money was a small price to
            pay.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as Kiyotaka can be useful for at least five years, there will be no problems
            even if he breaks down after that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because there is no need for my real child to be superior.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;She was quite a lovely woman, wasn&rsquo;t she, Ayanokoji-san?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro, who was waiting in the next room, appeared with the same smile as
            usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You did great work too. I made you play detective.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m a jack-of-all-trades, you know. But are you sure you want to trust
            her? If necessary, you might want to consider getting rid of her. She may be quiet as long as she has money.
            But with the way she is, she will run out of money in a few years. Or, she could lose her money to a man
            running away with it, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yes, you never know with people.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If she loses the money in the future, Mika may appear in front of me again. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I hope she is smart enough not to choose to do that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how filthy and worthless a soul is, it is not a joyful thing to disappear
            for nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s a standard practice to make the first move, but it depends on the
            time. If Mika disappears, it creates other risks. It is necessary for her to exist as a mother for
            now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With the sequence of these events, it is clear that I have no attachment to my child.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If this was revealed by the person who was my wife on the family register, my
            credibility in the financial world would be lost at once.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed. It is just as you speak.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In a few days, my child will be delivered to me after the tests are complete.
            We will then begin the fourth term experiments.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just like you, it seems that your son has a harsh life ahead of
            him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">These words sounded like pity, but Tsukishiro had no such feelings at all.</span>
    </p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.1pxezwc"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c14 c21">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On this day when Kiyotaka arrived in my possession, I was gathering Suzukake and
            other researchers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-sensei. This is the curriculum for the fourth term students who will
            begin this year.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tabuchi was using a computer with dark circles under his eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I read through the materials projected on the big screen as he explained them to
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When it was decided that Suzukake would lead the second term students, he created a
            curriculum with a total of 10 levels.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now, the fourth term students will be assigned difficulty level 4.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The dropout rate for first-term students who will turn five is 14%, the
            dropout rate for second-term students who are two years old is 6%, and the dropout rate for third-term
            students who are one year old is currently 6%. From now on, I expect more than 20% of the second term
            students to drop out when they reach 5 years old, and more than 25% of the third term students. I&rsquo;ve
            increased the difficulty until now, but I haven&rsquo;t touched the fourth term students yet.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The higher the level of difficulty required of the children, the steeper the passing
            line becomes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In particular, Suzukake&#39;s curriculum is structured in such a way that the
            difficulty level increases dramatically after the age of 6, when the foundation is solidified.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It would not be surprising if the dropout rate for first-term students also increases
            sharply in the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wonder how much the continued increase in difficulty will really change the
            situation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We have only three sets of data, but even when comparing the abilities of the
            first and third term students at the same age, the students on the lower end increased by 11% and the
            students on the higher end by 37%. I think this proves that the educational method you have proposed is
            connected to the improvement of human abilities.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The research so far seems to be going well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If we continue to educate children in order, we will eventually be able to produce
            children who are incomparable to those in the first term.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However - it will take many years to achieve this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Also, there are several significant changes. As an example, we have analyzed
            the results of those who dropped out, and discovered some problems. One, is their extremely low social
            adaptability. The reason is already clear: 99% of them only lived in the White Room. The first term students
            in particular can only understand the outside world through fragmentary learning materials and pictures. It
            would be impossible for them to imagine and draw cityscapes in their minds. They did not even have a good
            understanding of what Japan and other countries are like. The second and third terms showed improvement as
            they began to learn through video, but they still lack the everyday knowledge that a Japanese child should
            have. Their lack of recognition through hands-on experience with vending machines, streets, shopping malls,
            convenience stores, and supermarkets in the city caused great discomfort to outsiders. Even if they remember
            these things in words and letters, they cannot respond naturally because they have no real experience with
            them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So? What&rsquo;s the solution strategy?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;To put it simply, if we can take them out of the White Room and conduct
            something like extracurricular lessons, things will be simpler, but I know we can&rsquo;t do that. The more
            people acting outside, the greater the risk that the facility&#39;s existence will be known, and the impact
            on young children is immeasurable.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida continued his explanation and pulled out a pair of large goggles.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is where the virtual console comes in. Using VR, we can instill in them a
            strong sense of the outside world from an early age, allowing them to travel, learn, and memorize anywhere
            in the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya followed up in agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ishida-san&#39;s idea is not bad at all. It would be great if they can
            understand the minimum common sense that they need to acquire in a virtual environment. Even if it is in a
            virtual space, things can be reproduced perfectly, and the experience of walking through the world will be
            imprinted on their minds. I think it&#39;s going to be a lot easier to adapt to the outside world because
            the structure will be the same.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If they don&rsquo;t have to go outside the White Room, it would be a small price to
            pay.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I agreed, and approved the additional budget.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any problems with the curriculum&rsquo;s
            contents.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tabuchi nodded with satisfaction, and Ishida and Souya also stood up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&#39;t mind if you use the virtual console. You can try anything else you
            want to try. However, I would like to have a different curriculum for the fourth term students this
            time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Different, is it? What kind of change would you like to add?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked at Suzukake, who had been sitting quietly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We will adopt the Beta curriculum.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I conveyed so, the researchers tensed up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;..Huh? You&hellip; What did you just say?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake was probably more surprised than anyone else.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I said we are going to adopt the Beta curriculum. Don&rsquo;t make me say it
            over and over again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake had created a curriculum with 10 levels of difficulty.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The Beta curriculum, which is the most difficult of the 10 levels, is the one that
            Suzukake named as the one that is too different from the others. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When compared to the third term, not to mention the fact that things are more
            rigorous compared to the education at age 0, the level of difficulty jumps by a great magnitude after the
            age of 6, which is when the fundamentals have been laid out. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even I, not knowing much about education, judged that it was not feasible based on
            the curriculum and the limitations of the children that I saw from the first term education, and decided not
            to implement it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I explained it to you at the time. I divided the curriculum into 10 levels of
            difficulty, but Beta is on another dimension that will never be reached. In effect, the fifth or sixth level
            is the limit of human development.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think he is right. The second and third terms we are conducting now cannot
            even be compared to the Beta curriculum. The current curriculum up to the third term is also certainly not
            easy, and it would not be a compliment to say that it has produced remarkable results. In such a situation,
            putting out the Beta curriculum now would do nothing but break down our sample
            materials&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know that it is necessary for research to increase the difficulty level step
            by step. However, it takes time to climb up the stairs one step at a time. I would like to see the limits of
            human beings in this area. I don&#39;t care if they all drop out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of all the things, choosing this timing when your own son will be
            here..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My son is the one who will receive the most rigorous education. This is the
            perfect opportunity. If we can create even one successful student in the Beta curriculum, it will be a great
            opportunity for future research.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...However, what kind of criticism will we receive from the
            supporters?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I said we would adopt the Beta curriculum when my child is
            enrolled in the fourth term. It is for the sake of research. If I am to speak freely, I don&rsquo;t even
            care if he dies.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Everyone, including Ishida and the others, fell silent and were speechless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you&hellip; Are you really sure about this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida may be an eccentric researcher, but he is still a human being. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&#39;s why he&#39;s flaring at me, but he must have realized that this is the
            decision.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. Assign the fourth level of the curriculum that you were going to assign
            to the fourth term students to the next fifth term students. The only exception will be for the fourth term
            students. Because there&#39;s no point in implementing an inhumane curriculum if it has no
            future.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It will not be too late even after all the results from the fourth term students are
            present.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We have a reasonable sample of kids to finish things with this one
            time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I showed him the list of children who will be in the fourth term, which I had kept
            secret up to this point.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is&hellip; A total of 74 names!? This is more than double the number of
            children in the third term, you know!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I mostly picked up the have-nots that we can use and throw away.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The amount I paid to the Ooba group, and the black market brokers connected to them
            is not cheap, but it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to have some extra samples. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve conveyed
            to these people how serious I am. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, the truth is that there are a few children from the business world mixed in with
            the have-nots. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They must be dreaming of great growth in a stern environment. We took them in without
            accepting any responsibility. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I&rsquo;m hiding which ones are from the financial world from the
            researchers. I don&rsquo;t want them to get involved in any strange ways.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake, who had been listening in silence, walked up to Ishida and the others who
            were not so enthusiastic about the idea.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I myself have learned various things since I began researching with Ishida-san
            and the others. That there is a line one should not cross as a human being. So much that I regret creating
            the Beta curriculum. I can see nothing but a result of breaking down, but, as long as you insist,
            Ayanokoji-sensei, we have a duty to carry this out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But..!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As Ayanokoji-sensei said, as usual from the 5th term, this is a special case.
            It is also a great opportunity for me to reject the reckless curriculum that I have created. I know it will
            make the fourth term students cry, but I want you all to think that this will connect to the research of the
            future, and follow me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake who has been the leader for these few years also seems to have become quite
            the adult.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They constantly clash over the content of their research, but in the end, Ishida and
            the others nodded their heads in agreement, recognizing Suzukake&#39;s enthusiasm and determination.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s my job to worry about this. I&rsquo;ll be thoroughly involved in the
            education of the fourth year students too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because, as a representative of White Room, I myself should be here to witness the

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I understand what you are saying. Of course, I will obey your instructions.
            However, please let me make a recommendation for the treatment of those who have dropped out.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will speak clearly, but, the abilities of the children who have dropped out
            far exceed those of the average person. I can easily say that it is also a good accomplishment. I think that
            it is a waste to throw them away&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;At which level are you talking about? Do you think that the objective is to
            enter a top university, or to win some competition among the masses?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;N-no, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough as a reason for the public. However, the true
            objective is completely different. It is to give birth to humans who have the strength to protect this
            country from the world, make this country stronger, and move this country.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not as if we can simply create honour students, then send them into
            politics and win.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What is necessary, what I want, is the ability to overwhelm others.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Someone who will never give in, someone who has a will of steel that will never
            sway.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only a person who is appraised as a monster by others can cut their way into
            today&rsquo;s degenerated world of politics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Carefully care for and return the dropouts with a name to their parents. As
            long as they have exceptional abilities, they will be somewhat satisfied.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Then, what about the children with no names?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Same as planned. Send them to the facility you have set up and let them run
            wild. After training them not to talk about White Room, of course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But that alone makes it very difficult for them to become independent and
            integrate into society.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So what? We&#39;ve given them an education. Even though they have problems,
            they have probably shown more excellence than their peers. They&#39;ll have as many chances to crawl up the
            ladder as you want. Do you have a problem with that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tabuchi is the only researcher who is strongly resistant to the general idea.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why I have to give him a firm warning.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up and follow my orders. If you disobey my orders, I will cut you off
            without mercy, even if it&#39;s you. Is that clear?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Y-yes. I am very sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My cell phone rang. The caller was Sakayanagi.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving for a while. Please continue the discussion, including how
            to deal with the Beta curriculum.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I went out into the hallway and answered the phone just as the door closed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-sensei&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it, Sakayanagi? You sound very gloomy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to contact you in this manner, but I heard that you had a
            son.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right. I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t been in touch. I&#39;ve been in the middle
            of some things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Are you really sure about this? This is your long-awaited son, you
            know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;ve been prepared for this ever since we decided to build White Room.
            I&#39;m a man who educates abandoned babies. I never thought about having a legitimate family.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But I think that&#39;s a bit of a leap. The babies at the shelter have an
            unfortunate history of being abandoned. Rather, they are happy because they can grow up in White Room
            without any problems. But, your son is different. He deserves the love of his father and
            mother.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already made my decision.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the other end of the line, Sakayanagi gulped.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to turn this call around on you, but I&rsquo;d like to consult
            you about one thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Consult me, huh..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re going to have a baby too one day. I&rsquo;m ready
            to accept your child if you need me to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;... I&rsquo;m not as strong as you, sensei. When it is born, I intend to raise
            my child together with my wife with all of my love and devotion.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. I knew you would say that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s Sakayanagi. I&rsquo;m sure he will provide a proper education and raise an
            excellent child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll consider that as another result, and look forward to it on a personal
            level.</span></p>
