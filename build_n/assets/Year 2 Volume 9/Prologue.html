        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c23"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before long, I was the best both in academics and sports.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before long, I was surrounded by people trying to take advantage of me.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not like I worked that hard.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though we learned the same things at the same time, I had the ability to
                        learn
                        much better than the others.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surprisingly, that&#39;s almost a necessary condition to becoming popular
                        here.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Popularity is a talent.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ever since I was a child, I had the talent to become popular.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, I do know that not everyone likes me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure the guys who consider me their rival especially hate me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t care, though.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaving good and evil aside, I was happy as long as people saw me as a popular
                        person.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such is my life as a popular person, unchanged all through primary and middle
                        school,
                        a dazzling road.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, I have been unable to shake off the strange sense of discomfort I feel
                        from
                        time to time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sense of discomfort with no answer.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a life without even the slightest discomfort, that feeling alone always
                        remained
                        in my head.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sense of discomfort that remains even after being accepted by and controlling
                        everyone.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I decided not to care about it, though.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as I can continue being popular, this feeling of discomfort or whatever
                        it is
                        doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what I thought.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, things completely changed when I enrolled in high school.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could no longer ignore this feeling of discomfort swelling up in me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horikita Manabu. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That man a year above me had the respect of all those around him. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was much more dazzling and intelligent than me, and had a certain conviction
                        on
                        top of that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, another man who had a different type of talent than Horikita Manabu showed
                        up
                        under me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayanokoji Kiyotaka. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is very different and has a cocky attitude, but his ability is undeniable.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My accomplishments aren&rsquo;t inferior to theirs.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Along with the feeling of discomfort, sometimes, I think about it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is my ability truly the real thing?</span></p>
