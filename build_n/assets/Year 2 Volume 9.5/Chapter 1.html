    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <h2>The Song of Loneliness</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        December 24.
    </p>
    <p>First day of winter vacation.
    </p>
    <p>I woke up in the morning with a slightly strange sensation.
    </p>
    <p>“...That was a weird dream.”</p>
    <p> Muttering to myself, I sat up on my bed.
    </p>
    <p>Though only slightly, it looks like I was sweating in my sleep.
    </p>
    <p>I don’t normally care about my dreams that much.
    </p>
    <p>Whether it’s a good dream, a bad dream, a strange dream, a dream is just a
        dream and not reality, and humans are fundamentally creatures that forget
        their dreams.
    </p>
    <p>I wouldn’t be surprised to find exceptions to this in the world, but I’m also one
        of those who forget.
    </p>
    <p>Even if I remember them right after waking up, they get thrown out of my
        memory after a very short amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>“I think the homeroom teacher was a bunny-girl..?”</p>
    <p> Even if I try to force myself to remember, it’s mostly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>These may be strange words to hear for a third party…
        No, I don’t think the main point of the dream was the bunny-girl.
    </p>
    <p>It would be a waste of effort to keep trying to remember my dream.
    </p>
    <p>I quickly gave up on trying to remember it.
    </p>
    <p>School’s closed, so I slowly started my morning routine.
    </p>
    <p>Toothbrushes and cups of different colours lined up on the washstand.
    </p>
    <p>My daily life started to go back to the usual when Kei and I distanced
        ourselves from each other after always spending our time together.
    </p>
    <p>Still, that doesn’t mean our relationship has ended.
    </p>
    <p>Resulting from our disagreement, one could say that our relationship has
        entered a period of cold war.
    </p>
    <p>I don’t feel even a slight psychological change due to this.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it’s because things are developing according to my guidance, but if
        this was unexpected, then perhaps I could have felt a little shaken.
    </p>
    <p>“...I wonder.”</p>
    <p>
        One would have to consider the other party as absolutely essential in order to
        have a change of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>Without that, I don’t believe that emotions will be moved.
    </p>
    <p>Even if one considers the other person a part of their
        <a href="

            d'être,</a> there is no
        need to hesitate to make your partner suffer or throw them away if it is
        necessary.
    </p>
    <p>However, leaving emotion aside, I believe that one should have a sense of
        responsibility as a partner.
    </p>
    <p>As long as two people are spending time together, it is their joint liability to not
        make that time displeasurable.
    </p>
    <p>Still, if someone gives you their time, the most important thing in one’s life,
        then you should make them happy rather than not.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, this idea is based on human society’s moral values.
    </p>
    <p>It’s not a good policy to make someone the subject of my experimentation
        forever, making them psychologically uneasy and burdening them.
    </p>
    <p>It’s not as if I barged into this cold war without thinking; I have a plan.
    </p>
    <p>Going to buy christmas presents together like we promised before our
        relationship worsened.
    </p>
    <p>It's still a possibility.
    </p>
    <p>The day we had originally planned to go on a date in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, there were signs of rain outside and the cold weather had
        continued since before the winter vacation.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a little unfortunate, but there’s rain forecasted for tomorrow’s Christmas
        too, so I can’t expect pleasant weather.
    </p>
    <p>I can’t control anything about the weather, so there’s no helping that, but
        there’s something else that was outside my expectations.
    </p>
    <p>I looked at the calendar on top of the table in my room.
    </p>
    <p>December.
        The 24th and the 25th are marked with a pink heart, but…
        That was the night of yesterday when our second term ended.
    </p>
    <p>I tried to call Kei directly to meet with her on the 24th, but she didn’t answer.
    </p>
    <p>I waited a while and sent a message to wait for her reaction, but it was left
        unread.
    </p>
    <p>I thought about what to do for an hour, until a phone call finally came back.
    </p>
    <p>The first word Kei told me with her weak but rough voice was ‘influenza’.
    </p>
    <p>The seasonal cold is an illness that spreads unrelated to age.
    </p>
    <p>It’s very common around November and December, so this isn’t anything rare.
    </p>
    <p>Apparently, she suddenly got sick and had to rest.
    </p>
    <p>She was weakened, but I’m sure she wanted to fulfil our promise for the 24th,
    </p>
    <p>even if she had to crawl there.
    </p>
    <p>However, influenza spreads from splashes in the air.
    </p>
    <p>If she went to Keyaki Mall anyway, she would have troubled other people as
        well.
    </p>
    <p>She said that she was already feeling strange before the illness, and first and
        foremost felt bad for not taking better care of her health.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, I could not blame her for her influenza, so I first told her to take
        care of herself.
    </p>
    <p>I told her that our promise was still there, and that we would choose a different
        day.
    </p>
    <p>It could still be cancelled if Kei tells me that she wants to cancel the promise
        after all, but I don't think that's currently a possibility.
    </p>
    <p>If she has a change of mind, that would be due to a third party, but I don’t think
        someone who is strongly independent like Kei would listen to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>Because I don’t think she would abandon the choice if there is a hope of
        restoring the relationship.
    </p>
    <p>It’s unclear if her influenza will heal quickly, but at this stage, the conversation
        ended with a decision on meeting towards the end of the year.
    </p>
    <p>It’s easy to infer that there was a lot she wanted to check about our
        relationship and circumstances, but I don’t think she could converse normally
        when she was stricken by a high fever, so I told her to get some rest first and
        quickly ended the phone call.
    </p>
    <p>When I checked on her again in detail after, she was wondering how to handle
        her friends buying and bringing her necessities while she’s in bed.
    </p>
    <p>It seems that arrangements have been made to respond to emergencies even
        in the middle of night, which was helpful because of the curfew in that area.
    </p>
    <p>So, that was last night, on the 23rd.
    </p>
    <p>This morning, I learned that there were many more students of all years
        discovered to be infected with influenza.
    </p>
    <p>The one good thing for the year-two students is that they survived the special
        tests without any incident.
    </p>
    <p>There may have been those among them who were struggling with poor
        health in secret, though.
    </p>
    <p>I haven’t had any close contact with Kei for the last few days, so there’s no
        change in my condition.
    </p>
    <p>The more important problem is how to spend today.
    </p>
    <p>All of my plans for Christmas Eve, today, and Christmas, tomorrow, are gone.
    </p>
    <p>“Good morning Ayanokoji-kun. I heard that Karuizawa-san got influenza, is
        she okay?”</p>
    <p>
        A message from Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>The messages continued.
    </p>
    <p>“It looks like there’s a lot of other sick people. Are you okay?”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose does own a wide web of information, so she quickly learns
        everything.
    </p>
    <p>It looks like she also has a grasp on Kei’s bodily condition.
    </p>
    <p>“Unfortunately, I think she’ll have to be in bed for a while.”</p>
    <p>
        “I see… I’m worried about her. Let me know if you ever need any help.”</p>
    <p>
        “Thanks.”</p>
    <p>
        After repeating that exchange a few times, she asked me what I’m going to do
        today.
    </p>
    <p>This day was normally cleared up for Kei, but… I still have to stop by Keyaki
        Mall to pick up a certain item, so my plans remain the same.
    </p>
    <p>“I think I’ll go to the gym or something.”</p>
    <p>
        I followed the flow of the conversation, and since I’m not in the mood to meet
        anyone, I replied so.
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, right. Err, what time do you think you’ll be there?”</p>
    <p>
        “I have nothing else to do, so probably the forenoon.”</p>
    <p>
        “Oh. I was also planning on going to the gym during the day, but maybe I
        shouldn’t?”</p>
    <p>
        “Why?”</p>
    <p>
        “I mean, won't that look like we arranged to meet on purpose? Even though
        it’s just a coincidence.”</p>
    <p>
        We just happened to want to go to the gym, and the time we wanted to go
        coincided.
    </p>
    <p>There’s no need to worry about every little thing.
    </p>
    <p>This may be out of consideration for my girlfriend Kei, but I think that’s
        excessive.
    </p>
    <p>In contrast, if we adjusted things now, it would seem more like deceit.
    </p>
    <p>“You don’t need to worry about that. I’ll just go there as I planned. I’ll see you
        there if we happen to meet in the gym.”</p>
    <p>
        My message was quickly marked read, and she replied with a sticker of
        something like a mascot character holding an OK sign.
    </p>
    <p>Now then, I can put off getting dressed and doing my hair to get ready to go
        out for later.
    </p>
    <p>The hour’s just 9 o’clock.
    </p>
    <p>I should do laundry, clean and spend my time in the morning relaxing.
    </p>

    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        Inside Keyaki Mall in the forenoon, the atmosphere of Christmas Eve was in
        full swing.
    </p>
    <p>Inside the mall was decorated with even more gaudy ornaments than at the
        entrance.
    </p>
    <p>There seems to be a high ratio of male and female couples among the
        clientele spending time here.
    </p>
    <p>As I also told Ichinose, I entered the gym I joined the other day.
    </p>
    <p>I finished checking in at the reception while thinking that there could be no one
        else here.
    </p>
    <p>I changed into my sportswear and entered the training room, but it wasn’t
        empty after all.
    </p>
    <p>There are boys, girls and even adults around.
    </p>
    <p>The character who draws my attention most is the person about to start bench
        pressing.
    </p>
    <p>It was the homeroom teacher of Year-Two A Class, Mashima-sensei.
    </p>
    <p>He has a large, muscled physique, and his sportswear is very suitable for him.
    </p>
    <p>“Good morning Mashima-sensei.”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm? Ayanokoji? Were you a gym student too?”</p>
    <p>
        I called out to him when he was about to lay down on the bench, and he</p>
    <p>
        replied so with a little surprise.
    </p>
    <p>“I joined just a little while ago.”</p>
    <p>
        “Oh, really? That’s great to hear, welcome”</p>
    <p>
        For some reason, Mashima-sensei happily nodded, as if he was approving

        one of his students for passing an exam.
    </p>
    <p>He’s making a pretty big deal out of just one of his students joining the gym.
    </p>
    <p>“What made you join, though?”</p>
    <p>
        “I felt that my physical strength was diminishing compared to before, so I
        wanted to get it back.”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s not a very student-like reason, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        “I don’t know if I will continue for long, though.”</p>
    <p>
        “You should. I also started training after thinking about some things, but it’s
        actually turned into my daily routine now. It wouldn’t be a bad thing to sweat it
        out at the same place as your teacher.”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei seems very welcoming, maybe because he’s more excited
        than usual right now.
    </p>
    <p>“Also, I’ll commend you for going to the gym on your first day of the winter
        vacation.”</p>
    <p>
        “Do you have any plans for Christmas’ Eve today?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm? No, unfortunately, I’m planning on sweating it out in the gym the whole
        day.”</p>
    <p>
        He replied without any ambiguity. That’s what I thought, but…</p>
    <p>
        “Probably.”</p>
    <p>
        Probably.
    </p>
    <p>Why did he add on such an expression, even though he’s talking about
        himself?
    </p>
    <p>“Is something going on?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, nothing. So, you just started, right? You probably don’t know much here.”</p>
    <p>
        “Well, yes.”</p>
    <p>
        I don’t think I’ll have any problems with the equipment, but I’ll refrain from
        making any unnecessary remarks.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that as a newcomer, it would be more fun to act like I really am a
        newcomer, on the premise that I don’t know anything.
    </p>
    <p>Now, I should also start———</p>
    <p>
        “Alright.”</p>
    <p>
        “Alright?”</p>
    <p>
        “This is a great opportunity. You can watch how I train for a while.”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh? Oh, okay…”</p>
    <p>
        I was about to start training myself, but Mashima-sensei stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei laid down on the bench and put the bar at eye level with
        himself.
    </p>
    <p>He lightly put it up and down a few times, and put the safety bars a little higher
        than his chest.
    </p>
    <p>“Never forget the safety bars while doing a bench press. They’ll save you from
        getting crushed.”</p>
    <p>
        “Thank you.”</p>
    <p>
        I kept watching, unable to tell him that I knew.
    </p>
    <p>It feels awkward not to say anything, though, so I should ask him something.
    </p>
    <p>“How much can you lift?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hmm… I’m going to do 80 kg this time, but I can do up to 100 kg. They say
        that only one in a hundred people can do that.”</p>
    <p>
        He doesn’t have a confident expression, but his tone of voice is overflowing
        with pride.
    </p>
    <p>He put strength into his muscles and flexed.
    </p>
    <p>I’ve never heard of anything like that, but I do wonder if it’s true. It sounds like
        a cheap line that just gets repeated by everyone.
    </p>
    <p>“You’ll break your body if you push yourself too far, though. It’s not like the
        movies where you just lift once and it’s over, your chest muscles get better by
        repeating numerous sets.”</p>
    <p>
        It sounds like he’s practised a lot from television, but he started putting it into
        action after saying that.
    </p>
    <p>I was in a state of emptiness as I was shown the man's breath and the sweat
        that was pouring out of him.
    </p>
    <p>I watched him for a while after that, and Mashima-sensei sat up after finishing
        3 sets.
    </p>
    <p>“Phew. Well, that’s how you do it.”</p>
    <p>
        “That was very helpful.”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s the most important thing. I’m planning on coming here 6 days a week
        except Thursdays even during the winter vacation. It will be midnight from the
        third term, but you can always rely on me if you have any problem.”</p>
    <p>
        That’s very specific. I suppose there’s something happening on Thursday, which he clearly excluded.
        </d>
    <p>“I can teach you the basics if you need me to, but———”</p>
    <p>
        “No, it’s okay. I wouldn’t want to take up your time, so I’m going to focus on
        coming here for a while and doing some light training.”</p>
    <p>
        I quickly declined and put precedence on getting away from this spot.
    </p>
    <p>“I see. Well, talk to me any time if you have any problems. I’ll be here as much
        as I can during the winter vacation.”</p>
    <p>
        After receiving these welcomed words from a teacher, I started to work out on
        my own.
    </p>
    <p>I continued training in the gym for about 30 minutes after that, and noticed the
        atmosphere in the gym change for just a moment.
    </p>
    <p>Because all of the students working out suddenly turned their eyes in my
        direction.
    </p>
    <p>I checked what they were looking at, and it was a person I was used to seeing
        from class, Koenji.
    </p>
    <p>He had a lot of attention on him, but he didn’t mind it, and started training.
    </p>
    <p>I thought they were looking at me for doing something unusual, but that
        doesn’t seem to be the case. I can just barely hear the male students near me
        talking.
    </p>
    <p>“Wow, that Koenji guy really is something else.”</p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, I don’t think any other high schoolers could do that…”</p>
    <p>
        His physical ability, unusual for high school students can be seen from his
        training in the gym, so it seems that people were looking at him because of his
        skill.
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, one can easily see the level of perfection of his physique from a
        glance.
    </p>
    <p>The mass of refined muscles, and his flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>He made no unnecessary movements, and there was a seriousness there that
        one would not imagine from his usual eccentric demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>When I think about it, I get the impression that Koenji has no qualms about
        training his body in various places.
    </p>
    <p>As such, it’s not strange in the least that he would be going to a gym, and
        rather I would say he is a very suitable man for it.
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei also stopped his hands to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>Objectively, one can easily say that Koenji is far past the level of a student.
    </p>
    <p>With his natural physique, he spares no effort in his daily training to maintain
        his body.
    </p>
    <p>I learned once again that Koenji is always in pursuit of fitness even in school,
    </p>
    <p>no matter the time or place.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike Mashima-sensei who is only slightly better than a beginner, Koenji
        displays training that is truly captivating.
    </p>
    <p>Further, let alone get anxious or lose his temper because of the attention, he
        is the type who flourishes under it.
    </p>
    <p>“koenji-kun’ always so popular.”</p>
    <p>
        Someone said those words to me, backing up the fact that getting attention is
        a usual thing for Koenji.
    </p>
    <p>“Good morning Ayanokoji-kun.”</p>
    <p>
        Then, she greeted me.
    </p>
    <p>“Hey.”</p>
    <p>
        “There’s a lot of rain again today, huh? By the way, when did you get here?”</p>
    <p>
        “About 30 minutes ago, I think.”</p>
    <p>
        “I see. I was planning on coming here around that time too actually, but I
        ended up chatting with a friend a little and got late.”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose said so standing next to me and staring at me from a close distance.
    </p>
    <p>“Pretty unfortunate, considering that today’s Christmas Eve, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “Well, it’s whatever. There’s no reason anywhere to consider this a special
        day.”</p>
    <p>
        “It may be different for girls though, you know?”</p>
    <p>
        “I see… I can’t deny that.”</p>
    <p>
        As long as I am a man, I can’t tell whether it’s men or women who cling onto
        special days more.
    </p>
    <p>After a light chat, Ichinose told me that she wanted me to run with her, so we
        lined up on two machines next to each other.
    </p>
    <p>We ran at our own pace for about 30 minutes without chatting after that.
    </p>
    <p>“You feel a lot more motivated when you’re doing this with someone else,
    </p>
    <p>don’t you?”</p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, I guess so. In that sense, it was the right thing to start with Amikura,
    </p>
    <p>huh?”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose laughed and wiped the sweat from her forehead with a towel.
    </p>
    <p>After that, I enjoyed the gym with Ichinose for around one more hour.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I told Ichinose that I will be leaving just as Amikura got here, so we
        separated as she went to chat with her.
    </p>
    <p>“Leaving already?”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei stopped training and called out to me when he saw me about
        to leave.
    </p>
    <p>He says ‘already’, but I think two hours is plenty long enough to be in the gym.
    </p>
    <p>“Yes. Well, I got tired. You know it’s been 2 hours, right, sensei?”</p>
    <p>
        “2 hours? Hm, I see. I never noticed.”</p>
    <p>
        Was he too engrossed in his training to take notice of the time?
    </p>
    <p>“I think you should rest a little more, Mashima-sensei. You kept going for
        around 3 hours without resting that much, right? Fatigue accumulates where
        you can’t see, and you might also get an injury.”</p>
    <p>
        Ready to be yelled at for trying to give advice as a newcomer, I gave him
        some words of advice.
    </p>
    <p>Then, he wasn’t angry but surprised, and crossed his arms.
    </p>
    <p>“...You may be right. I wanted to throw away my weakness and become a fine
        teacher, but it might have the opposite effect.”</p>
    <p>
        I suppose no one around gave Mashima-sensei advice like this until now.
    </p>
    <p>He wants results fast. He wants muscles.
    </p>
    <p>It seems he was so focused on that, that he forgot to even feel tired.
    </p>
    <p>“Alright. I’ll leave it here for today too.”</p>
    <p>
        Saying that, he earnestly took in my advice.
    </p>
    <p>“See you later, then.”</p>
    <p>
        I said my farewell and walked away, but Mashima-sensei quickly chased after
        me.
    </p>
    <p>“Is it alright if we chat a little?”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh? Of course.”</p>
    <p>
        I thought it would be related to the gym, but he invited me to the rest area
        instead.
    </p>
    <p>“Did I do something in the gym that bothered you, sensei?”</p>
    <p>
        I didn’t really understand why he called me here, so I asked him about it.
    </p>
    <p>“Of course not. It’s nothing like that, so don’t worry. You passed your time in
        the gym with no problems.”</p>
    <p>
        It feels like he didn’t watch me the whole time, though…</p>
    <p>
        He looked at my doubtful eyes and averted his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>“...I was too focused on my training to look around, I’ll honestly confess that.”</p>
    <p>
        He apologetically dropped his shoulders, perhaps sensing that I was seeing
        through him.
    </p>
    <p>That reaction makes me feel like I'm the one that did something bad.
    </p>
    <p>Teachers are on winter vacation too.
    </p>
    <p>They’re free to enjoy whatever they want on these grounds, and they don’t
        have to keep watch over the students.
    </p>
    <p>I ended up pulling an apology out of him by utilizing his responsibilities as an
        adult.
    </p>
    <p>“So, you wanted to talk with me..?”</p>
    <p>
        I tried to change the subject, and Mashima-sensei looked around just once to
        confirm that there was no one else around.
    </p>
    <p>“Actually, I have something to ask of you.”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh?”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei corrected his posture before continuing but was interrupted
        by a visitor.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a woman with long, wavy hair.
    </p>
    <p>A worker in the gym noticed us and approached smiling.
    </p>
    <p>“Mashima-san, you worked really hard again today, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, I really didn’t.”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei replied while greeting her.
    </p>
    <p>He’s been coming here longer than me, so I suppose they know his name.
    </p>
    <p>“This is..?”</p>
    <p>
        “His name is Ayanokoji. He’s an excellent student from B class, a different
        class than the one I’m in charge of.”</p>
    <p>
        He lightly tapped me on the back, telling me to introduce myself.
    </p>
    <p>At least he intended to, but his strikes are quite strong thanks to his muscles…
        “My name is Ayanokoji.”</p>
    <p>
        “We met at the reception desk a few times, didn’t we? You were with
        Ichinose-chan.”</p>
    <p>
        Impressive. It looks like even I left an impression on her, despite only coming
        here for a few days.
    </p>
    <p>“Ah, sorry, you’re resting. I just came here to get something I need, so excuse
        me.”</p>
    <p>
        She nodded in a well-mannered way, grabbed a few towels from an employee
        shelf and headed to the reception desk.
    </p>
    <p>Mashima–sensei continued looking at the woman until she disappeared,
    </p>
    <p>waiting to be left alone with me.
    </p>
    <p>……
        He’s not making any movements.
    </p>
    <p>“Sensei?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm, what, Ayanokoji?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, I mean… You wanted to talk to me about something, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “Oh, right. Well, I think we should do this next time.”</p>
    <p>
        “Okay? Well in that case, I’ll be taking my leave.”</p>
    <p>
        “Wait.”</p>
    <p>
        He grabbed my shoulders when I turned around.
    </p>
    <p>“...What now?”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei is a little strange today.
    </p>
    <p>His image as a quiet, calm teacher is getting cloudy.
    </p>
    <p>“I’ll confess that I think this is a stroke of luck.”</p>
    <p>
        “You’re confessing to a lot today, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        It looks like he’s finally getting to the point however, so I suppose I should be
        relieved.
    </p>
    <p>“That worker who was here just now, she’s Akiyama-san.”</p>
    <p>
        “I didn’t pay much attention, but she had a name tag. So?”</p>
    <p>
        “...I want you to look into her. As carefully and discreetly as you can.”</p>
    <p>
        “Huh?”</p>
    <p>
        I was about to turn around, but he’s holding my shoulders with such strength
        that it’s impossible.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>“I’ve never brought in a problem of the other gender into school up until now.

        However, the situation changed after I began going to the gym. I don’t have to
        say all the details for you to understand, do I?”</p>
    <p>
        “Well, I get what you’re trying to say. You have feelings towards this
        Akiyama-san, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “...You could say that too.”</p>
    <p>
        No, that’s the only thing I could say.
    </p>
    <p>“She has a child-like face somehow, but she’s also a proper, beautiful adult
        woman.”</p>
    <p>
        “Right…”</p>
    <p>
        She really is a beautiful adult woman, but that manner of speaking makes me
        feel a little uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>“What about Hoshinomiya-sensei or Chabashira-sensei? It’s not like romance
        between teachers is forbidden, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “It’s forbidden in the rules.”</p>
    <p>
        “Ah, I see. There’s probably teachers dating in secret, though.”</p>
    <p>
        “I’ll just say that I won’t say there aren’t. In the first place, those two would not
        be candidates even if it weren’t forbidden.”</p>
    <p>
        He said that in a very definitive way.
    </p>
    <p>“May I ask the reason?”</p>
    <p>
        “Sorry, but I’m not going to tell you. We’re teacher and student. That would be
        a useless conversation, wouldn’t it?”</p>
    <p>
        “I’ll be taking my leave, then. What we were talking about just now is useless
        as well, so.”</p>
    <p>
        “Hoshinomiya’s character isn’t serious enough. Chabashira’s character is too
        serious. That’s all.”</p>
    <p>
        A short but easy to understand reply came back from Mashima-sensei.
    </p>
    <p>Considering their reputations on equal terms, Hoshinomiya-sensei is a young
        maiden who falls in love often.
    </p>
    <p>I’m sure she would be flirty and continue her friendships with the opposite
        gender even if she entered a relationship.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Chabashira-sensei hasn’t had even one boyfriend since
        her student days.
    </p>
    <p>I feel like it would be a serious love if she ever fell for someone of the opposite
        gender.
    </p>
    <p>“You can’t know for sure that Akiyama-san isn’t like that either, though.”</p>
    <p>
        Even if you can’t tell from outward appearances, when you start dating———
        “She definitely isn’t.”</p>
    <p>
        He quickly said no with all of his strength, even though he has no basis for it.
    </p>
    <p>“I knew those two since my student days, and never looked at them as the
        opposite gender even once. Not once. Above all, if I support those two who
        are my friends, and also rivals, it would cause a big change in my school life.”</p>
    <p>
        Mashima-sensei assertively said that he would never want that to happen.
    </p>
    <p>“Well, that’s true.”</p>
    <p>
        “So, I need your help.”</p>
    <p>
        “Why me?”</p>
    <p>
        “Do you think I can ask the other teachers?”</p>
    <p>
        “No, but…”</p>
    <p>
        “You’re the only person who goes to the gym and can keep a secret.”</p>
    <p>
        “Wait, sensei, the reason you were happy to see me at first today…”</p>
    <p>
        “It was because I made a new gym friend, of course.”</p>
    <p>
        No, that’s definitely a lie.
    </p>
    <p>Those eyes were definitely the eyes of someone who found a student he can
        utilize for this matter.
    </p>
    <p>I can say that for certain now.
    </p>
    <p>“You know what I want to learn, don’t you?”</p>
    <p>
        “I can guess. Whether she has a boyfriend or not. Her type, and her hobbies
        and stuff she likes.”</p>
    <p>
        “Full score. Chabashira must be really happy to have a student like you.”</p>
    <p>
        Is this guy really the Mashima-sensei I’ve known all this time?
    </p>
    <p>I know professional and private lives should be considered on a different
        basis, but this side of him really is surprising.
    </p>
    <p>His voice is really calm, but I can’t see his expression.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m not telling you to start right away. Akiyama-san saw you with me today.
    </p>
    <p>You can start when winter vacation ends or something, so please slowly get
        close to her and look into her.”</p>
    <p>
        Carefully and cautiously. Just as Mashima-sensei wants.
    </p>
    <p>“I’ll do my best, but please don’t expect too much.”</p>
    <p>
        “I know.”</p>
    <p>
        “About Akiyama-san’s working days…”</p>
    <p>
        “6 days a week except Thursdays.”</p>
    <p>
        “...Right. So you knew.”</p>
    <p>
        The way Mashima-sensei asserted that he goes to the gym every day except
        Thursday did feel a little strange.
    </p>
    <p>I’m sure he did join here to improve his own body, but his objective turned into
        Akiyama-san instead…</p>
    <p>
        It’s not like he’s being negligent in his training though, so there’s no point
        faulting him for it.
    </p>
    <p>I was finally released from Mashima-sensei’s binding, so I left like I was
        running away from something.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        Right after leaving the gym, I started thinking about my plans for later.
    </p>
    <p>I should take the item from the shop I planned on going by, then take a stroll in
        Keyaki Mall and go home.
    </p>
    <p>As for Mashima-sensei’s request, I can take it slow, like the person in question
        himself said.
    </p>
    <p>I hope that he solves it himself while I think about how to extract information.
    </p>
    <p>It’s still just past noon.
    </p>
    <p>I’ll have too much time on my hands if I go back to my room now.
    </p>
    <p>I took out my phone and opened my address book.
    </p>
    <p>It wouldn’t be a bad idea to hang out with some male friends once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>“...Nothing.”</p>
    <p>
        I gently turned my phone’s screen off after taking a quick look.
    </p>
    <p>I can’t remember many times when I spontaneously called a friend of the
        same gender and hung out.
    </p>
    <p>“Wanna hang out a bit later if you’re free?”</p>
    <p>
        When I say that…</p>
    <p>
        “I’m busy.”</p>
    <p>
        …and decisively get rejected like that, it feels extremely shocking.
    </p>
    <p>Yousuke would infer how I feel and accept my invitation, but I don’t want him
        to worry about me.
    </p>
    <p>In short, it takes a lot of labour to invite someone, and it’s quite the big deal.
    </p>
    <p>In the end, I reached the conclusion that it’s best to be alone without troubling
        anyone.
    </p>
    <p>“What even are friends, I wonder?”</p>
    <p>
        I realize again that even though I’m entering the latter part of my second year
        here, I still don’t handle this subject very well.
    </p>
    <p>I went down to the first floor with an escalator.
    </p>
    <p>It’s still mid-day, so there are more students here now.
    </p>
    <p>There’s no other way than to talk to someone myself, is there?
    </p>
    <p>A chance meeting, for example.
    </p>
    <p>I should make it so that someone randomly finds me, and asks me to hang
        out.
    </p>
    <p>I looked around with that in mind, but I can’t find any classmates around at this
        time.
    </p>
    <p>As for same-year students…</p>
    <p>
        No, I don’t even see any of them.
    </p>
    <p>I would look too suspicious if I clumsily looked around to try and find someone.
    </p>
    <p>So, I quickly decided to give up on the route of meeting up with someone.
    </p>
    <p>I’ll change my objective for today to enjoy it by myself.
    </p>
    <p>I stopped before a map of the mall.
    </p>
    <p>I know where every shop is already, but I wanted to check if a new one
        opened.
    </p>
    <p>However, the shops don’t change much, and I don’t see anything new.
    </p>
    <p>There is one shop that grabs my attention, though.
    </p>
    <p>“I should check it out.”
        It was the rental shop, which I don’t usually visit that often.
    </p>
    <p>You can rent DVDs and BDs of videos, like movies or anime, whether they’re
        new or old.
    </p>
    <p>Other than that, they also have music discs.
    </p>
    <p>However, you can get permission from the school and pay a monthly fee to
        watch movie contents using a broadcasting service as you want, so this place
        isn’t very needed.
    </p>
    <p>This shop is utilized only by students who watch things occasionally, or
        students who are looking to find something specific.
    </p>
    <p>So, it's not a very popular place.
    </p>
    <p>That’s precisely why I decided to go there on this winter vacation.
    </p>
    <p>I have extra time, so it should be okay to do this once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>I feel like I’ve been lining up excuses for a while now, but I’m certainly not
        lonely.
    </p>
    <p>I should let myself know that again, just to make sure.
    </p>
    <p>After picking up the shop item I planned on taking, I reached the rental shop.
    </p>
    <p>It’s certainly not a big shop; I would rather say it’s cramped.
    </p>
    <p>All kinds of different discs are on display in this cramped space.
    </p>
    <p>They would normally be stored in a box or a case, but they’re in black or
        transparent OPP bags in this shop, with a printed paper glued to their
        backsides, where you can see what the item is.
    </p>
    <p>When using a computer or a tablet, one first checks the titles and the
        thumbnails to see if it’s interesting.
    </p>
    <p>When you’re checking everything in your hands one by one like this, you pick
        up things you never would have otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>Further, I read through the entire summary.
    </p>
    <p>While countless works are readily available, it's not a bad idea to search for
        good ones once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>I might start coming to the rental shop more often.
    </p>
    <p>But, there’s still one problem.
    </p>
    <p>Even if I do find something interesting, there’s no need to rent it here.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe if it’s something rare that isn’t on the internet, but otherwise I can just
        go back to my dorm and watch it as I want.
    </p>
    <p>I’m sure these rental shops are going to get even more difficult to operate in
        the future.
    </p>
    <p>It’s the same with electronics retail stores.
    </p>
    <p>I’ve heard that most people look at items in the store, then buy them cheaper
        online.
    </p>
    <p>I looked around the movie corner for a while, then went to the music corner.
    </p>
    <p>Normally, I’m not someone who listens to music that often.
    </p>
    <p>I hear the latest hits and the best songs of former years on TV, but that’s it.
    </p>
    <p>I have no experience purchasing music myself, and I still don’t have much
        interest in it.
    </p>
    <p>That’s why I’m exploring. I hope I can encounter something.
    </p>
    <p>I thought there was no one else in the rental shop, but it looks like there was
        one other customer.
    </p>
    <p>She has headphones on, and there’s BGM music in the store as well, so she
        doesn’t seem to have noticed me.
    </p>
    <p>I couldn’t tell who it was at first, but her details became clear when I
        approached closer.
    </p>
    <p>It was Shiranami Chihiro, who is based in the Ichinose Class.
    </p>
    <p>I haven’t talked much with her, but we’ve rarely encountered each other a few
        times at events.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, it was during the Uninhabited Island Test, and we also had contact
        on the ship afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>I wonder what she’s listening to?
    </p>
    <p>I’m curious, as I don’t know much about Japanese music (though it could be
        something else).
    </p>
    <p>But Shiranami is focused on listening to her music, so I don't think she will
        hear me if I talk to her too quietly.
    </p>
    <p>She’ll get startled if I forcefully enter her line of sight, however.
    </p>
    <p>I could have waited until the song was over, but there are going to be hurdles
        to talking to her and asking about it later, so I decided to get close and listen.
    </p>
    <p>While pretending to be looking around the store to not look suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>“Ah..!?”
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 9.5/Images/image1.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        Crap. I guess I startled her.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe I approached too closely since I’m curious about what she’s listening
        to.
    </p>
    <p>She hurriedly took her headphones off.
    </p>
    <p>“A-Ayanokoji-kun!?”</p>
    <p>
        “Sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.”</p>
    <p>
        Since she took them off, I can clearly hear the music coming from her
        headphones.
    </p>
    <p>I can hear a somewhat sorrowful guitar and a woman’s singing voice.
    </p>
    <p>“My broken heart, only time can heal. Someone else, other than him———”</p>
    <p>
        I guess it’s a song about being lovelorn.
    </p>
    <p>Then, she quickly turned the song off by pushing the stop button.
    </p>
    <p>“D-D-Do you need something!?”</p>
    <p>
        She asked, still a little surprised.
    </p>
    <p>“No… I don’t need anything, but I was just wondering what you were listening
        to. That’s all.”</p>
    <p>
        I replied honestly, but whether she will be convinced or not is another matter.
    </p>
    <p>I’m someone from another class with whom she is not close with, and
        someone whom she wouldn’t talk to if she didn’t meet with him by
        coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>Considering the differences between men and women as well, I might look
        very suspicious right now.
    </p>
    <p>“Sorry to bother you, I’ll take my leave.”</p>
    <p>
        I don’t want to pointlessly stay here and keep bothering her.
    </p>
    <p>The only thing I can do now is to quickly get away from her.
    </p>
    <p>“Err, umm…”</p>
    <p>
        She looks like she wants to say something.
    </p>
    <p>At the very least, she is not the type of person who can easily talk to those she
        is not familiar with.
    </p>
    <p>Still, if I try to urge her to speak, it will only have the opposite effect.
    </p>
    <p>So I didn’t look at her, and instead averted my gaze to another spot.
    </p>
    <p>I’m going to create an environment where she can speak comfortably and wait
        for her.
    </p>
    <p>“Umm… Do you have… some time now..?”</p>
    <p>
        A surprising extension request from Shiranami.
    </p>
    <p>“Sure, but can we really chat here?”</p>
    <p>
        From what I can see, this isn’t going to be about music.
    </p>
    <p>If we start chatting about unrelated things here in a rental shop without
        spending money either, then we’re going to be unwelcome guests.
    </p>
    <p>“Right… I’m fine with anywhere, and I don’t think it’s going to take that much
        time, so…”</p>
    <p>
        “Then…”</p>
    <p>
        “Ah, but, I don’t want to draw any attention, I think. I don’t want anyone to
        misunderstand…”</p>
    <p>
        I was about to ask to go to a cafe, but that’s out of the question now.
    </p>
    <p>“What shall we do, then? We can go wherever you’d like.”</p>
    <p>
        “...I’ll leave it up to you.”</p>
    <p>
        She’s entrusting it to me, with certain limitations.
    </p>
    <p>This does feel a little unusual, but I made contact in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>I should think of a spot that meets her demands.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        After that, Shiranami and I started walking while I thought about a few places.
    </p>
    <p>It would be hard to go to the roof in school, since it’s raining and the weather’s
        pretty bad.
    </p>
    <p>Still, there are a lot of students around inside the buildings.
    </p>
    <p>The one saving grace is that Shiranami seems very keen on avoiding me.
    </p>
    <p>In most cases like this, you would walk one or two steps apart even if you
        aren’t close with each other, but Shiranami is walking at quite a distance
        behind me.
    </p>
    <p>You probably wouldn’t think we were together if you looked at us from the
        side.
    </p>
    <p>So, even though it’s Christmas Eve, I don’t think I need to worry about us
        being mistaken as a couple.
    </p>
    <p>“...What?”</p>
    <p>
        “It’s nothing.”</p>
    <p>
        I feel like Shiranami’s going to go even further back if I pay too much attention
        to her.
    </p>
    <p>It’s not like I invited her, but she still looks worried.
    </p>
    <p>Still, I’m the one that started chatting with her, so I suppose I have no choice.
    </p>
    <p>Wandering around aimlessly, we arrived at a resting area.
    </p>
    <p>It’s an area with a few vending machines and two benches without backrests.
    </p>
    <p>I knew that there were surprisingly few students utilizing this place, and today
        is no exception either as I don’t see anyone else here.
    </p>
    <p>“Do you want something to drink?”</p>
    <p>
        “I don’t think so.”</p>
    <p>
        “Shall we sit on a———”</p>
    <p>
        “No, it’s okay.”</p>
    <p>
        I was turned down in a row and gave up.
    </p>
    <p>“Can I ask what you wanted to talk about?”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami stood facing me at some distance and started fidgeting with her
        hands.
    </p>
    <p>“Ayanokoji-kun… Umm… What’s your relationship with Honami-chan?”</p>
    <p>
        “What do you mean?”</p>
    <p>
        “Just classmates? Friends? Or… Something more than that?”</p>
    <p>
        Her words are indistinct, but they make her question very clear.
    </p>
    <p>It seems that my reply will be very important for Shiranami.
    </p>
    <p>I know why, of course.
    </p>
    <p>It was one of the events that originally led me to building a relationship with
        Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>Last year, just a few days after I enrolled, Ichinose was confessed to by
        Shiranami right in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike a normal friend, she felt feelings of love towards her like the opposite
        gender.
    </p>
    <p>No, that expression isn’t accurate.
    </p>
    <p>In our current age, it’s a mistake to make an issue of whether the genders are
        the same or opposite.
    </p>
    <p>Shiranami, as a person, has feelings towards Ichinose as another person.
    </p>
    <p>That’s all there is to it.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, she doesn’t like the fact that Ichinose likes me.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a very simple and easy to understand diagram.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m wondering what the right answer would be. I’m a bit confused, but…”</p>
    <p>
        “Don’t hold yourself back for my sake, just answer.”</p>
    <p>
        “I’m not holding back. It’s just a little hard to judge if I can call her my friend.”</p>
    <p>
        “...What does that mean?”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami raised her eyebrows with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>“I have very few friends. I don’t really understand what a friend is that well in
        the first place. You wouldn’t call someone a friend just because you talk to
        them, right? Where’s the line between an acquaintance and a friend?”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s, hmm, I wouldn’t really know the answer to that…”</p>
    <p>
        “Me neither. From my point of view, I think that we have a friendly
        relationship.”</p>
    <p>
        “I don’t really get it… Are you deliberately trying to evade the question?”</p>
    <p>
        That’s not my intention at all, as I meant to give a serious answer.
    </p>
    <p>“You’re just friends then, right? I can say that you don’t, umm, have any
        feelings like love towards each other, right?”</p>
    <p>
        I never asked Shiranami directly, but I don’t think she doesn’t know Ichinose’s
        feelings.
    </p>
    <p>She said ‘towards each other’, but I’m sure what she really wants to know is
        how I feel.
    </p>
    <p>“Of course you don’t, right? I mean, you’re dating Karuizawa-san, so.”</p>
    <p>
        She couldn’t wait for my answer and added onto her question.
    </p>
    <p>“Does it matter if I have a girlfriend or not? For my answer about my feelings
        towards Ichinose.”</p>
    <p>
        “Of course it does. I mean, you’d only fall in love with one person.”</p>
    <p>
        She came back with a romantic, rather, pure reply.
    </p>
    <p>She believes this with all certainty without doubt.
    </p>
    <p>“Don’t some people see more than one person at the same time as an object
        of love?”</p>
    <p>
        Unrelated to gender, I can definitely think of a case like this.
    </p>
    <p>“N-No!”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami however strongly denied it.
    </p>
    <p>I can tell she’s angry from the fact that she’s squeezing her small hand.
    </p>
    <p>“Sorry. That was unrelated to this matter. There’s nothing you should be
        worried about between Ichinose and me right now.”</p>
    <p>
        “...Right now?”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami, obviously sensitive to each and every one of my words, picked up
        the word I said as insurance just to make sure.
    </p>
    <p>“No one knows what will happen in the future.”</p>
    <p>
        “Still, if you had a normal relationship, I don’t think you’d add the ‘now’...”</p>
    <p>
        She may be right about that.
    </p>
    <p>If this was about a girl like Amikura instead of Ichinose, I may not have said
        ‘for now’ as insurance.
    </p>
    <p>I could have clearly said that she is just a friend, nothing more or nothing less.
    </p>
    <p>“Even if… Even if Honami-chan likes you, you wouldn’t have added the ‘right
        now’ if you didn’t have any feelings towards her… Those words wouldn’t have
        come out if you weren’t planning on breaking up with Karuizawa-san and
        dating Honami-chan.”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami managed to find the words she probably didn’t want to say.
    </p>
    <p>It takes courage to say these words, even though they are uttered by
        someone that is probably at my nose level.
    </p>
    <p>“I think that it’s okay for Honami-chan to, err, fall in love with anyone she
        wants…. But I’m not gonna stay quiet if she starts dating someone who’s
        dishonest.”</p>
    <p>
        “Do you become a dishonest person if you date and break up with someone
        once?”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s… No, but…”</p>
    <p>
        Ichinose’s classmate Shiranami can’t talk about Ichinose’s situation.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that she had already felt the changes, but that doesn’t seem to be
        the case.
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose’s new face.
    </p>
    <p>I really don’t want any unintentional influence from me until I figure out how
        the new Ichinose functions.
    </p>
    <p>So, even if it was going to cast a shadow inside Shiranami’s mind, I had no
        choice but to add in the ‘now’ and be noncommittal.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m not trying to worry you, but as long as there is the possibility that you will
        not accept it calmly, no matter what I say, I can’t help but add an insurance
        and be roundabout.”</p>
    <p>
        This may be a little stern, but it’s best that I convey things clearly.
    </p>
    <p>She had an expression that said ‘that’s not true’ for a moment, then thankfully
        seemed to notice that her passion had reached heights she was not
        expecting.
    </p>
    <p>“...I’m sorry. I think I said way too much…”</p>
    <p>
        She was so desperate that she forgot how far she was going.
    </p>
    <p>That’s all.
    </p>
    <p>“You really worry about Ichinose, huh?”</p>
    <p>
        It’s normal for her to be worried for her as a friend, and as someone whom she
        holds feelings for.
    </p>
    <p>“U-Umm… I’m, I’m really sorry!”</p>
    <p>
        She gravely accepted her blunder and started calming down.
    </p>
    <p>“I’ve just been hearing a lot of rumours about you two lately…”</p>
    <p>
        “Rumours are rumours.”</p>
    <p>
        “Yeah… I heard you were going to the gym together while ignoring your
        studies, or that you let her into your room even though you have a girlfriend…
        I can’t believe people are spreading such untruthful rumours…”</p>
    <p>
        Hm… Hmm?
    </p>
    <p>“W-What is it? Why do you look so weird and stiff all of a sudden?”</p>
    <p>
        “I’m just wondering where such untruthful rumours, no, trivial truths are
        spreading from.”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s a weird way of being roundabout. Rumours and truths are unrelated,
        aren’t they?”</p>
    <p>
        “In many cases, yes.”</p>
    <p>
        “...Huh?”</p>
    <p>
        “Hm?”</p>
    <p>
        “You haven’t been going to the gym with her… Right?”</p>
    <p>
        “No. I just happened to start going to the gym. I can run into her by
        coincidence there, can’t I?”</p>
    <p>
        Just like today.
    </p>
    <p>I got contacted by her before, but it’s not like we met in the gym on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>“I guess that’s right. Mako-chan goes to the gym too, but that thing about you
        letting her into your room… That’s definitely just an underhanded rumour,
        right?”</p>
    <p>
        “That’s right. I haven’t been calling Ichinose and inviting her into my room.”</p>
    <p>
        Something like that happened three times with Ichinose, but the first time was
        in the midst of the Class Voting Special Test.
    </p>
    <p>The second time was that rainy day at the end of the school year.
    </p>
    <p>The third one was recent, but that was just because Ichinose waited outside
        my room of her own initiative.
    </p>
    <p>I suppose someone saw her waiting there the third time.
    </p>
    <p>“...I’m gonna believe you.”</p>
    <p>
        Shiranami said with some hesitation as she finally had a positive expression.
    </p>
    <p>The problem is, depending on how she receives things in the future, she might
        think that she was betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps I should supplement just to be safe.
    </p>
    <p>However, I would cast a shadow over her heart again if I clumsily say
        something that sounds like an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>“Can I say one thing?”</p>
    <p>
        “M-Mhm. What is it?”</p>
    <p>
        “No matter who Ichinose ends up loving, or who she loves now, it’s not as if
        your value is going down. That might change if you do something that Ichinos
        wouldn’t want, though. You know what I’m trying to say, right?”</p>
    <p>
        “...Mhm.”</p>
    <p class="italic">
        I can’t be with the person I love. I don’t like it, so I’m going to interfere with her.
    </p>
    <p>If the person she loves sees that kind of thinking, she’s obviously not going to
        like it.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m a pretty unpleasant girl, aren’t I?”</p>
    <p>
        I suppose she started remembering the things she said today after calming
        down.
    </p>
    <p>“I said nothing but complaints to you, almost like I was taking my anger out on
        you…”</p>
    <p>
        I felt that the whole time as well after she said that she’d like to change
        location and chat.
    </p>
    <p>Still, even leaving out the part where I’m the one who startled her, I never had
        any intention of reproaching her.
    </p>
    <p>“Despite you helping me when I got lost at the Uninhabited Island Test that
        summer…”</p>
    <p>
        Ever since Shiranami enrolled in this school, she’s always held special
        feelings towards Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>I can understand why she would half-unconsciously harbour resentment
        towards someone like me.
    </p>
    <p>“I don’t mind. I’m the one who bothered you, and I should apologize for
        sounding like I was lectur———”</p>
    <p>
        “I’m really sorry!”</p>
    <p>
        Before I could finish my apology, Shiranami returned it back instead.
    </p>
    <p>“Umm, err, it’s not as if I hate you… I really don't.”</p>
    <p>
        I already know all that, but Shiranami doesn’t, so she started explaining for her
        own sake.
    </p>
    <p>She’s not going to be convinced if I interrupt her, so I suppose I should just be
        the listener for a while.
    </p>
    <p>After that, Shiranami continued apologizing while spreading the conversation
        in all directions with 80% apology and 20% explanation.
    </p>
    <p></p>
