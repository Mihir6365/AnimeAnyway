    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h2>A Love Letter</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        Tuesday, November 9.
    </p>
    <p>In the morning, I ran into Horikita in the elevator on my way to school.
    </p>
    <p>After exchanging a quick greeting, we left the lobby and went directly outside the dormitory
        together.
    </p>
    <p>"Have you heard? The day before the cultural festival, the entire third grade students are
        preparing a rehearsal just like it would be, on the next day."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, I heard they're inviting first years and second years to participate as well."
    </p>
    <p>This is exactly the information that was posted on the school bulletin board last night to inform
        the entire school. The source of the information was the student council - in other words, it was
        Nagumo's decision. This must be what Nagumo himself said last week that the student council
        would make a not-so-bad proposal.
    </p>
    <p>It was up to us to decide how we would participate. It can be a simulated food service or an
        actual one. It is only a proposal to make adjustments for tomorrow's festival altogether.
    </p>
    <p>"Many classes have already announced their participation in it to the student council. I'm sure
        the classes that have been keeping it secret all this time will want to get a third-party review
        before the festival."
    </p>
    <p>"So you're saying more classes are taking it positively."
    </p>
    <p>"I think it's because the 3rd year A class rented the gymnasium and put on a public performance
        that everyone is taking it well."
    </p>
    <p>The exhibits were announced without keeping it any secret and were demonstrated in person.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, the way they integrated the enhancements that emerged from that approach
        became widely known among the students enrolled in the school. There must have been a
        certain percentage of students that wanted this festival to be successful and for them to enjoy it
        as students rather than as a competition.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sure the student council's decision to pay for consumable materials and other expenses
        was also an additional factor for it."
    </p>
    <p>Even if you do a preparatory run, it will still cost money.
    </p>
    <p>It is necessary to set up a separate budget from the one provided for the festival, and the source
        of funds will naturally be in the form of collecting private points from individuals.
    </p>
    <p>It would not be surprising if some of the classes would have missed the preparatory event if they
        had to pay out of their own pocket for the rehearsal, but that is what the student council is all
        about. If the student council covers the cost of the event, there is almost no reason to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>They have already announced that if Classes bring in receipts, they will be paid off from the
        student council's budget.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it wasn't unlimited, but there were tens of thousands of points evenly set for each
        class.
    </p>
    <p>"We're going to participate in it, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course. The whole school knows it's going to be a maid cafe. So, There's no loss in doing it."
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. And then There's also the matter of Ryuen."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita gave me a serious look, and I replied with a gentle nod.
    </p>
    <p>"Let's see what they have in store for us."
    </p>
    <p>It was a great opportunity to see how Ryuen would develop the concept.
    </p>
    <p>"Do you feel like we can lose?
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>"You look pretty confident."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not confident. I'm just doing everything I can."
    </p>
    <p>"That's true. Even so, don't you usually feel insecure?"
    </p>
    <p>Apparently, Horikita is concerned that she might lose, even though she is fully prepared.
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe I'm scared about losing."
    </p>
    <p>Defeat doesn't only mean losing class points. But it’s just as bad to fail to earn class points.
    </p>
    <p>Wanting to avoid stagnating is natural when you're on the momentum of reaching Class A.
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe last year you wouldn't have been so anxious."
    </p>
    <p>"It was just recklessness... no, I was just not seeing anything around myself at that time."
    </p>
    <p>Now, Horikita was starting to broaden her horizons a little. That's why she couldn’t help but think
        about losing.
    </p>
    <p>"As a class leader, it's not a bad thing to be prepared for both winning and losing. I'm just one of
        the pawns making irresponsible statements."
    </p>
    <p>Well, it’s Horikita's shortcoming and strength that she cannot easily dismiss that statement. If it
        was Sakayanagi or Ryuen, they would’ve listened and dismissed it; if it was Ichinose, she
        would’ve taken it as if it was the only thing that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita has both of these aspects.
    </p>
    <p>"I know, but... Sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>I patted Horikita on the back with the palm of my hand.
    </p>
    <p>"What are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's too early to get used to winning."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not going to…"
    </p>
    <p>She looked a little angry, but she also realized that I hit the nail on the head.
    </p>
    <p>"It was a conceited notion, not the result of anything I’ve done well myself."
    </p>
    <p>The uninhabited island, unanimous exam, those weren’t victories supported solely by
        straight-up skills.
    </p>
    <p>"You mean…?"
    </p>
    <p>"What?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm trying not to take everything you say seriously, but you've been very cooperative lately,
    </p>
    <p>which is even more annoying. I don't know how to process this in my head."
    </p>
    <p>"Then please don't cooperate with me at all in the future."
    </p>
    <p>I tried to walk quickly away, but she grabbed me by the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>"That's rejected."
    </p>
    <p>I tried to get away, but was immediately grabbed and brought back.
    </p>
    <p>"I'd like to stop by the convenience store before going to school, would you like to join me?"
    </p>
    <p>"Convenience store?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm preparing for the day before the school festival, and I want to make the most of my lunch
        break today."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't mind joining."
    </p>
    <p>A few minutes in a convenience store wouldn’t be a problem.
    </p>
    <p>I followed Horikita to the convenience store and stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>There we ran into Koenji, who was just about to pay for his items.
    </p>
    <p>He had only two things: a bottle of soy milk and a white meat salad.
    </p>
    <p>It was a very light meal for lunch, but I wondered if he was going to have it during his morning
        break.
    </p>
    <p>Since Koenji is rarely seen eating, his private life remains a mystery to us.
    </p>
    <p>"Good morning, Koenji-kun."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita called out to him, but after paying for his things, Koenji only smiled lightly and didn’t
        exchange any words.
    </p>
    <p>"I heard that Koenji is the only one not assigned work for the cultural festival."
    </p>
    <p>"He told me he wouldn’t do anything. I'm sure I won't change his mind."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita didn't seem particularly concerned either and went to the cash register to select a quick
        meal.
    </p>
    <p>She refused the plastic bag offer and tucked it away in her own bag.
    </p>
    <p>"You didn't have anything to buy?"
    </p>
    <p>"They don't have anything I need, and I don't have stacks of private points."
    </p>
    <p>With the month of November, my wallet was filled to some extent, but I had plans to cash out
        soon.
    </p>
    <p>"You're no longer paying points to Kushida-san, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Not really, since I haven't been charged for it."
    </p>
    <p>"Would you really pay if she asked you?"
    </p>
    <p>"Do you think she will ask me?"
    </p>
    <p>Horikita replied to me with distaste, muttering,
    </p>
    <p>"No, I don't think so. I don't want her to come back to troubling self and bother again."
    </p>
    <p>Whatever the distortion, Kushida showed great change.
    </p>
    <p>And we must believe that it is heading in the direction of growth.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        After school that day. Ichihashi approached Horikita, who was sitting in front of her, with some
        hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>"Um, Horikita-san... can I talk to you for a minute?"
    </p>
    <p>She usually does not have a strong connection with Horikita and rarely talks to her.
    </p>
    <p>Usually, one would think that it would be about the cultural festival that is about to begin.
    </p>
    <p>But the item held in her hand, implyed otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>"What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Actually, I have a favor to ask you. You have student council work later today, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. As I told the class a while ago, I have student council work to do. I can't help you with the
        festival."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, that's not what I meant. This… Can you please...?"
    </p>
    <p>With these words, she presented a letter.
    </p>
    <p>A glimpse of a heart sticker clasped the envelope's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>"What's this?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's a love letter but…"
    </p>
    <p>"Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>No wonder she looked puzzled, unable to comprehend the meaning for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>Even though we live in an age where diversity is accepted, it is understandable that a love letter
        from a girl to a girl would be more upsetting in another way than the opposite gender.
    </p>
    <p>"Ah, uh? It is not from me to Horikita-san or anything like that. Actually... I was asked by a friend
        who wanted me to give it to the Student Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>"To the student council president? But isn't that something you should give in person?"
    </p>
    <p>If you're going to confess your feelings to someone you have a crush on, face to face is
        naturally the expectation.
    </p>
    <p>"She asked me to deliver it to him because she was too nervous to give it herself. But I don't
        have the courage to hand it to the student council president in person either…"
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo, for example, is more sociable than former student council president Manabu Horikita,
    </p>
    <p>but he is still a senior and representative of the school.
    </p>
    <p>It would be a considerable hurdle for someone who is not in contact with him to approach him.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, on the other hand, was different. It was easy to imagine them conversing about student
        council business on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>"I understand the situation, but…"
    </p>
    <p>"Please. She's been struggling with it for a long time now, and... she's finally found the courage
        to do so."
    </p>
    <p>If it was Horikita from a year ago, she might have declined the request.
    </p>
    <p>But building her relationship with her classmates is now important to her.
    </p>
    <p>There was no way around it to make up for her lost trust in the unanimous special exam.
    </p>
    <p>"Okay. I'll see if I can somehow find an opening and give it to him for you. Is that okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"Uh, yes."
    </p>
    <p>Ichihashi answered, but she looked a bit tense.
    </p>
    <p>"Is there still a problem?"
    </p>
    <p>"Um, well, there's a little problem with this love letter."
    </p>
    <p>When Horikita received the letter, he noticed that there was no name on either the front or the
        back. This means that the sender is unknown until you confirm the inside.
    </p>
    <p>"Can I assume that it is written inside who this letter is from?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know... If it were normal, I’d imagine it would be written. That girl, if she was just happy
        to tell him how she feels, she might not have written it."
    </p>
    <p>In other words, neither the deliverer nor the receiver would know the sender of the love letter.
    </p>
    <p>"That's a little hard to accept. Of course, I'll explain when I give it to him, but if I'm not careful, he
        might mistake it for a letter from me."
    </p>
    <p>Saying she received it from someone else despite it actually being a letter from herself— the
        possibility of Nagumo taking it like that cannot be said to be zero.
    </p>
    <p>"Well then, can't you ask someone else? Like a boy you know in the student council or... No? I'd
        like for you to give it today somehow."
    </p>
    <p>"That's easier said than done…"
    </p>
    <p>Despite her doubts, Horikita thought for a moment and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll do my best, but there's no guarantee that I'll be able to give it to him, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm glad Horikita-san took the job. I'm sure she'll be very pleased."
    </p>
    <p>Although hesitant, Horikita agreed to deliver the love letter to Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>Normally, she would have asked who the letter was from, but Horikita was not interested and did
        not try to go deeper into the matter.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        Because of the unexpected request, my steps were a little bit... No, they were quite heavy.
    </p>
    <p>"Why won't she just give it to him herself… jeez!"
    </p>
    <p>It was a mistake to accept this, and why did I, an irrelevant person, took something like this—.
    </p>
    <p>I should turn back and tell Ichihashi-san to give it to him in person.
    </p>
    <p>"That would be the right thing to do."
    </p>
    <p>When the feeling of escape came to mind.
    </p>
    <p>I suddenly remembered the time when I was about to give a letter to my brother who had
        decided to go to high school.
    </p>
    <p>I was an idiot and I didn't even realize that my brother was being cold towards me and was
        desperate to somehow get back to the old days when we were close.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that if I couldn't talk to him face to face, I could just put my feelings in a letter. But the
        pen in my hand didn't move as smoothly as it did in my head.
    </p>
    <p>For days and days, I thought and wondered, writing and erasing over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>How could I convey my feelings?
    </p>
    <p>How could I make my brother happy?
    </p>
    <p>I struggled with the act of writing the letter itself.
    </p>
    <p>And in the end——— I couldn't hand it over.
    </p>
    <p>My brother left for this school and I could no longer see or contact him.
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder what happened to that letter…"
    </p>
    <p>As I dig up my memory, I recalled putting it in my brother's desk drawer.
    </p>
    <p>"What if my brother goes home and sees it?"
    </p>
    <p>I stopped in the hallway and felt my heart rate suddenly hasten. If my brother saw a letter like
        that now, he would laugh at me.
    </p>
    <p>"———Let's forget about it."
    </p>
    <p>Even if I get agitated here and now, It won't help in getting rid of the letter and pretend it never
        happened. Now all I can do is hope that my brother doesn't find it.
    </p>
    <p>Remembering my brother's back from outside the window, I decided to put my hands together.
    </p>
    <p>"That’s right."
    </p>
    <p>Writing a letter to someone you love is difficult. Additionally, the obstacle is significantly greater if
        you have to give it to them directly.
    </p>
    <p>Even now, I would find it difficult to respond right away if someone asked if I could write my
        brother a letter.
    </p>
    <p>I don't know who she is or where she is from, but she wants to give it to the Student Council
        President Nagumo Miyabi.
    </p>
    <p>I understand her feelings of nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>I made my way to the student council room and somehow came up with a reason for myself to
        present it to him. Except for Student Council President Nagumo, all of the student council
        members were present when I opened the door. Yagami-kun, a first-year student, Aga-kun, also
        a first-year student, and Kiriyama-senpai, the third-year vice president, were the three boys
        present.
    </p>
    <p>However, it would not be possible for just any boy to do what I need. I couldn’t simply entrust
        them with the task of handing out love letters, which isn’t even a responsibility for the student
        council.
    </p>
    <p>But I was relatively close to Yagami-kun. I talk to him quite regularly. I knew I was taking
        advantage of my position as a senpai, but I couldn’t turn my back on this letter. Yagami-kun was
        sitting down and chatting with Ichinose-san.
    </p>
    <p>I reached for the love letter, hoping to get the troublesome matter out of the way quickly. But just
        then, Student Council President Nagumo appeared in the room.
    </p>
    <p>"The meeting will begin immediately. Take your seats."
    </p>
    <p>The voice of Student Council President Nagumo was as dark and heavy as he appeared. I felt
        the air instantly become tense and tight and put my hand back on my bag.
    </p>
    <p>There was no way I could say that I was asked to hand over a love letter under these
        circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>"Ichinose, if you have anything to report, let's hear it."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. It seems that it has been decided that all classes will participate in the rehearsal the day
        before the festival."
    </p>
    <p>"It was decided in almost half a day? It seems that the student council president's decision was
        correct. However, if the decision was made by the student council, I wish you would have
        informed us a little earlier."
    </p>
    <p>Kiriyama-senpai, the vice president, made a pointed remark.
    </p>
    <p>"It's just an idea. I thought starting a little earlier would make the juniors feel at easy and happy."
    </p>
    <p>Student Council President Nagumo replied without any particular apology.
    </p>
    <p>Such a scene from the student council meeting was becoming a regular occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>Basically, the student council-led things started with an idea from Student Council President
        Nagumo. Sometimes they were born from a comment made during the meeting, and other times
        they were created without our knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>Then there was a sudden silence, and Student Council President Nagumo had his arms
        crossed and his eyes closed. It was obvious that he was holding back his anger.
    </p>
    <p>"Um, what's wrong, Nagumo-senpai...?"
    </p>
    <p>"Listen, I heard a strange rumor."
    </p>
    <p>"Rumor...?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's not proven, but there was some guy, who said that I was betting a lot of money to get
        certain students expelled from school."
    </p>
    <p>"What? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>It's no wonder Ichinose-san asked back. I, too, could not immediately understand the meaning
        of what Student Council President Nagumo said.
    </p>
    <p>"Who told you that nonsense?"
    </p>
    <p>"Someone from your class, Kiriyama."
    </p>
    <p>Student Council President Nagumo threw such words to Vice President Kiriyama with his eyes
        closed.
    </p>
    <p>"From my class?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's just gossip among friends, so it wouldn't be strange if you were aware of it."
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, that's news to me. I don't understand why you would bet a lot of money to get someone
        expelled in the first place."
    </p>
    <p>Typically, students will spend a lot of money to get a certain person into an "A" class. Even for
        me, if that's what he was referring to, it's not difficult to grasp. But The odds were stacked
        against students, particularly third-years, and if they were permitted to get into President
        Nagumo's class, they have essentially assured an "A" class status till graduation. It's more
        possible—for lack of a better word—that Nagumo, president of the student council, granted
        those with whom he has strong links, private points in secret, granting them the chance to get
        into his class.
    </p>
    <p>"It's just a rumor. But I'm not willing to sit idly by and let the accusations against me go
        unchallenged."
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, as student council president, such rumors could damage him one way or the other. It’s
        understandable that he was visibly in a bad mood.
    </p>
    <p>"The student council will be suspended for a while."
    </p>
    <p>"Suspended...?"
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose-san was surprised by this unexpected proposal from Student Council President
        Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>The student council used to meet like this once a week and repeatedly discuss various topics.
    </p>
    <p>The only exceptions were during test periods and some special exams. It was unusual to
        suspend them during the regular school year.
    </p>
    <p>"We're done discussing the cultural festival, too. There shouldn't be any problems."
    </p>
    <p>"Are you going to look for the culprits?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course, we'll look for them thoroughly. The next meeting will be held after the festival."
    </p>
    <p>We then continued discussing the day before the festival, and we departed shortly afterward. I
        got up from my seat and headed toward Yagami-kun.
    </p>
    <p>He looked up from his notepad, halted his hand, and closed it as if he had sensed my approach.
    </p>
    <p>He was maintaining the logs because he serves as the student council's secretary.
    </p>
    <p>The other students left the student council room ahead of me, which I was grateful for.
    </p>
    <p>When the two of us were alone, I decided to call out to him.
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder if it's okay to talk?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun turned to me after looking a little surprised.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, were you still in the middle of writing it down?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, I just finished. Don't worry about it."
    </p>
    <p>He placed his hand lightly on top of the closed notebook and smiled at me.
    </p>
    <p>"Is something wrong, Horikita-senpai?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yagami-kun. May I ask you a slightly unreasonable favor?"
    </p>
    <p>"What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"I want you to give this to the student council president. It's a love letter."
    </p>
    <p>I took out the love letter and presented it to Yagami.
    </p>
    <p>"That's very rare these days. Most of the time it seems to be done through chatting or phone
        calls…"
    </p>
    <p>When he received it with a surprised look on his face, I hastened to add.
    </p>
    <p>"Just to let you know, it's not from me."
    </p>
    <p>"I see. I thought it was a love letter from Horikita-senpai... Or should I just give it to him as
        such?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, that's not it. A girl in my class asked me to give it to him."
    </p>
    <p>"There is no sender name. Whose love letter is it? I'll let him know."
    </p>
    <p>"I can't tell you that. She wants to remain anonymous."
    </p>
    <p>"It’s an anonymous love letter...?"
    </p>
    <p>"She asked for me to pass it on as a member of the student council, but there’s the issue of
        anonymity, and if I give it to him, he might think it's from me, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's quite possible. To be honest, I still have a little bit of doubt in my mind that it might have
        been written by Horikita-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun smiled a little funnily, but to me, it was anything but funny.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm just kidding. I can tell by the look of disgust on your senpai's face that it's not."
    </p>
    <p>I sure hope that's the case.
    </p>
    <p>"Actually, it would’ve been smoother if I had given it to you before Student Council President
        Nagumo arrived…"
    </p>
    <p>"Even if you gave it to me, I don't think I would’ve been able to hand it over. It didn't seem like
        the kind of atmosphere to give a letter."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, that was inevitable."
    </p>
    <p>Under the circumstances, no one could talk to Student Council President Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry to ask you to do this, but could you please deliver it as soon as possible? I'm sure
        they think I’ll deliver it today."
    </p>
    <p>"In that case, I'll visit the dormitory later."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun stared at the love letter intently while looking a little perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>"Is this really a love letter?"
    </p>
    <p>"Probably. I think she said she put her feelings into it, but I can't be sure."
    </p>
    <p>I couldn't peel off the seal to see what was inside.
    </p>
    <p>"If I gave it to him as a love letter and it turned out to be different, I think it would be disrespectful
        to the student council president."
    </p>
    <p>"That might be possible."
    </p>
    <p>"I'll put it somewhat vaguely, saying that I received the letter from someone."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, I think that's a good idea. Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>I thanked him for his honest acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>"By the way, even in this day and age, it's hard for a secretary to work with handwritten notes,
    </p>
    <p>isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with using a computer to work nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>"Tradition is also important. It seems that the notes have been kept on file ever since this school
        was founded. If we suddenly switch to digital, it’ll create a sense of discomfort."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun turned to face the bookshelf and fixed his gaze there. Undoubtedly, there are
        numerous records that tell the history of the Student Council. The student council files being
        replaced with a disc wouldn't necessarily be a terrible thing, but Yagami-kun made a valid
        argument. If we cherish tradition, perhaps we should keep doing this.
    </p>
    <p>"I also hear that it is better to have hardships while you are a student. If you get used to easy life
        early on, you may suffer later on."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun showed a slightly mature response, not like a first-year high school student.
    </p>
    <p>"In that sense, this love letter is similar."
    </p>
    <p>It is true that nowadays it is not uncommon to confess one's feelings using one's cell phone. But
        I can understand that there is a certain meaning to conveying your feelings through your letters.
    </p>
    <p>"Even so, today's Student Council President Nagumo really didn't seem to have a lot of time to
        spare, did he?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. He's betting a lot of money to expel the students, isn't he? As I recall… What was his
        name…"
    </p>
    <p>As if remembering something, Yagami-kun opened his notebook and showed it to me.
    </p>
    <p>The first page that was flipped through was from the middle of last year and looked like
        something a current third-year student would have written in his sophomore year.
    </p>
    <p>Then the page changed and switched to the most recent notes.
    </p>
    <p>I instantly recognized this because the notes, which seemed to have been written by
        Yagami-kun, were written in a perfect, orderly manner that showed his meticulousness.
    </p>
    <p>And the writing was so polished that it was hard to believe it was handwritten.
    </p>
    <p>"There it is. He said that this Kishi-senpai might have spread a rumor. Do you know what class
        Kishi-senpai is in?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun asked me with the same expression, as usual, showing me the meeting records.
    </p>
    <p>But my brain was pulled into another realm all at once.
    </p>
    <p>These characters.... They look very similar to that letter which had almost slipped from my
        memory.
    </p>
    <p>Was he the person who presented me with the letter during the uninhabited island exam?
    </p>
    <p>I held my gaze, which was about to blur with agitation, and reached the notes of today's
        meeting.
    </p>
    <p>I looked at Yagami-kun from a broader perspective and saw that he was still looking at me with
        the same smile.
    </p>
    <p>It couldn't be... But... No, it can't be.
    </p>
    <p>Amidst a whirlwind of emotions, I think as I continue to feign looking down at the notes.
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita-senpai?"
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, I don't know, but you should be able to figure it out pretty quickly if you look at the OAA."
    </p>
    <p>"Sure. I'll look it up right away."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but I just remembered something I have to do. I'll leave you to
        it."
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, really? I understand."
    </p>
    <p>I looked away from him and quickly turned as if to run away.
    </p>
    <p>"Well then, I'm sorry, but I need you to take care of my letter to the student council president."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, senpai. Thank you for your hard work, Horikita-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>If he stared at me then, I probably would have asked him. I knew in my gut that I had to avoid
        that. I exited the door connecting the student council chambers
        and slowly closed it.
    </p>
    <p>Just before it was about to close, I saw Yagami-kun smiling at me through the door’s slightest
        gap. He looked at me with a smile, as if he was testing me.
    </p>
    <p>It was as if he was challenging me with a question, "Did you notice?" It was as if he was trying to
        provoke me.
    </p>
    <p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken the trouble to open the notebook and show me the
        handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>The door slammed shut.
    </p>
    <p>The possibility that they happen to have similar handwriting cannot be ruled out.
    </p>
    <p>Since I saw that letter, a lot of time has passed, and my memory is blurry.
    </p>
    <p>Yet, for some reason, it was similar enough for me to be certain.
    </p>
    <p>Assuming he is the one who wrote the letter to me… he has been by my side the whole time
        and has been remaining composed and level-headed at all times.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, it did not seem to make this speculation very realistic.
    </p>
