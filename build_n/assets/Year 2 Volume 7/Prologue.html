    <h2>Hasebe Haruka's Monologue</h2>
    <p>
        When I evaluate myself, I consider myself to be a bad person.
    </p>
    <p>Everyone has done something once or twice that they were told 'You must not do.'
    </p>
    <p>For example, ignoring a red light.
    </p>
    <p>Even if you didn't have any malicious intent, you probably have some experience.
    </p>
    <p>For example, if you receive more change at the checkout, and you do not return it.
    </p>
    <p>Even if it is 1 yen or 10 yen, if the clerk mistakenly gives more, mostly no one returns it.
    </p>
    <p>For instance, spitting on the roadside or littering on the street.
    </p>
    <p>I know it sounds a little far-fetched, but it also qualifies as an offence/crime.
    </p>
    <p>However, that experience alone does not position me as a bad person.
    </p>
    <p>I…
        No, it could also be insignificant from someone's perspective.
    </p>
    <p>But because of my past, I decided not to make friends in school.
    </p>
    <p>I wanted to distance myself from my former friends and enter a world where I was not connected to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>So, when I learned about the existence of the Advanced Nurturing High School, I remember deciding that this was
        the place for me.
    </p>
    <p>I thought it would go that way, but I found myself making friends.
    </p>
    <p>Kiyo-pon, Yukimu, and Miyacchi.
    </p>
    <p>And... Airi.
    </p>
    <p>I have regained my youth.
    </p>
    <p>That's what I thought.
    </p>
    <p>But that youth was taken away from me on one unexpected day.
    </p>
    <p>Who took it from me?
    </p>
    <p>Surely, it's certain.
    </p>
    <p>Suzune Horikita and Kiyotaka Ayanokoji.
    </p>
    <p>I was a victim of the selfishness of these two people.
    </p>
    <p>I can't allow it.
    </p>
    <p>I can't forgive them.
    </p>
    <p>That is why——
        I decided to take revenge.
    </p>
