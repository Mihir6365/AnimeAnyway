    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <h2>Towards the Cultural Festival</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        It was Monday, November 1, the beginning of Autumn and chilly fall weather.
    </p>
    <p>The months go by quickly, and in two months we will be on winter break.
    </p>
    <p>Will the view I had from my new seat comes to an end in the not-too-distant future?
    </p>
    <p>The fact that I feel regret for leaving is proof that the seat change was good for me. I don't know
        if there will be a seat change next year, but either way, the scenery will be very different from
        what it was before.
    </p>
    <p>"Good Morning. Is everyone here?"
    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei entered the classroom seconds after the bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>The students, who had been engaged in chit-chat, suddenly quieted down and looked and
        listened to her with a habituated look.
    </p>
    <p>The school's unique approach, in which all class attitudes are evaluated by the entire class, has
        resulted in serious and disciplined behavior.
    </p>
    <p>Not that anything has changed significantly compared to last week. But I can feel that it is a little
        better than last week.
    </p>
    <p>Seeing such a situation with students who continue to grow day by day, Chabashira-sensei
        deeply nodded her head and opened her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>"I believe preparations are steadily underway for the festival, but I have an additional point to
        explain. First of all, as a reminder, I will display an outline of the cultural festival again, so please
        check it if you need it."
    </p>
    <p>The monitor behind Chabashira-sensei lit up and the explanation of the rules reappeared.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="center bold">
        Cultural Festival Outline
    </p>
    <p class="center italic">
        ● Each class in the second grade is given 5,000 private points per student that can be
        used only for preparation for the festival, and they are allowed to use them freely within
        that range.
    </p>
    <p class="center italic">(5500 points for first-year students and 4500 points for third-year students for the
        initial funds)
    </p>
    <p class="center italic">
        ● Additional funds are awarded for community services, such as student council service,
        and contributions through club activities.
    </p>

    <p class="center italic">
        (Details will be announced for each class once confirmed.)
    </p>
    <p class="center italic">
        ● Initial and additional funds are not reflected in final sales and will be forfeited if unused
    </p>
    <p class="center italic">
        ● 100 class points will be awarded to the 1st through 4th place classes.
        Fifth to eighth place classes will receive 50 class points.
        No change in class points for classes 9th through 12th.
    </p>
    <p class="center italic">
        "So far, that's everything. You should be able to get this far in your mind without any difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>Without any question from the students, Chabashira-sensei continues.
    </p>
    <p>"I would like to announce that the details of the 'additional funds' mentioned in this overview
        have been finalized."
    </p>
    <p>Additional Funds. The program is to increase the number of points available for the festival
        based on student council service, community service, and activities by clubs. The time has
        finally come to announce the details of this program.
    </p>
    <p>The lack of a finalized budget made it impossible to determine the number of offerings, their
        contents, and their scale.
    </p>
    <p>Despite the inconvenience, it is not a problem if all classes in all grades are in the same
        situation.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="center italic">
        "First of all, It will display the total amount of additional funds given to this class, with the
        breakdown all at once."
    </p>
    <p>As soon as Chabashira-sensei said this, operating her tablet, a spreadsheet list was displayed.
    </p>
    <p>It turns out that a total of 12 people were eligible for this additional funding.
    </p>
    <p>Suzune Horikita, Student Council Officer Bonus - 10000 points
        Ken Sudo Club activity bonus - 10000 points
        Kayano Onodera, club activity bonus - 10000 points
        Although only three students were able to obtain that high amount of additional funding,
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps 10,000 points were the maximum, nine other students received hundreds to thousands
        of points in recognition of their contributions.
    </p>
    <p>For example, Yosuke gets 3,000 points for the club activity bonus, and Akito gets 1,000 points.
    </p>
    <p>Many names of students who seem to be active mainly in club activities were mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>In total, the class obtained a total of 39,400 points of additional funds.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of number of people, this corresponds to an initial point for almost six people.
    </p>
    <p>These funds are essential for the working of the festival.
    </p>
    <p>"I can't give you the breakdown, but the Sakayanagi A class received 18,800 points. Ryuen C
        class received 17,000 points, and Ichinose D class received 26,600 points in additional funds. In
        other words, among the second-year students, this class has the most additional funds."
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose's class is 2nd, and Sakayanagi's class is 3rd, beating the Ryuen class by a small
        margin.
    </p>
    <p>That's an unexpected result, but one factor could be the student council officer bonus. It is
        simply significant that both Horikita and Ichinose received 10,000 points for their presence
        alone.
    </p>
    <p>Other reasons could be that Other students such as Sudo and Onodera are considered to be
        the best above the rest in their contributions to club activities throughout the entire school year.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the school festival, private points owned by individuals cannot be used at all, so in the case of
        the Horikita class, The total number of initial funds of students in the Horikita class plus
        additional funds is 229,400 points. Even one extra point is good.
    </p>
    <p>However, we should not be too proud to look at these results alone.
    </p>
    <p>Although it is advantageous in the preparatory stage before the start of the project, as long as
        the additional funds are not reflected in the final sales, they will be a wasted treasure if they are
        not well utilized.
    </p>
    <p>These seem to be the explanations for the additional funds, but this should not be the end of the
        story.
    </p>
    <p>Several pieces of information needed for the festival have not been made public.
    </p>
    <p>"Now. Next, I'll give you some details about the guests, which is very important for making
        sales."
    </p>
    <p>How many and what kind of guests will come at the cultural festival?
    </p>
    <p>And how much money they have has not been told so far.
    </p>
    <p>"The guests are those who are involved in the operation of the school and their families.
    </p>
    <p>Naturally, there will be a wide range of ages, from the elderly to young children and elementary
        school students. It has also been decided that those who work at the Keyaki Mall and
        convenience stores will also be treated as guests."
    </p>
    <p>The tablet screen switched to a graph, revealing the number of guests by age.
    </p>
    <p>Those in their 30s and 40s accounted for the largest percentages, followed by those under 20
        and those in their 50s.
    </p>
    <p>"Each adult guest will receive 10,000 points. Minors will receive 5,000 points. There were 283
        adults and 202 minors. The total number of participants will be 485, and the total amount of
        points will be 38,400,000."
    </p>
    <p>The ranking of all 12 classes in all grades depends on how much sales can be made from that
        total.
    </p>
    <p>"I should also mention that the number of participants includes us, the teachers. Homeroom
        teachers are bound to not be able to use points in the grade for which they are responsible, but
        they will be treated no differently than any other guests."
    </p>
    <p>
        It would be essential to bind them to not use their points in the same grade. As homeroom
        teachers, they would normally want to drop money on their own class if they could.
    </p>
    <p>"Is it possible to use more than given 10,000 points?"
    </p>
    <p>In response to the question from Ike, Chabashira-sensei immediately shook her head from side
        to side.
    </p>
    <p>It was an expected question, as usual, but she answered it without paying particular attention.
    </p>
    <p>In fact, she seemed to be enjoying the unchanging Ike.
    </p>
    <p>"No thanks. You cannot spend more than the given points. The maximum amount is fixed."
    </p>
    <p>It means that guests do not have unlimited funds available to them. It is not a matter of
        preventing certain greedy guests, but it is inevitable that there will be competition and fighting
        for the guests.
    </p>
    <p>"The key method of payment is through a dedicated cell phone application, which allows the
        school to track sales in real-time. Keep in mind that the app will be disabled the moment the
        festival ends at 4 p.m. You are free to set your own timing for the checkout, but we recommend
        pre-payment before you offer the product."
    </p>
    <p>In some cases, particularly in the case of restaurants, payment is made after eating, which
        means there can be cases where it can go after 4:00 pm.
    </p>
    <p>It means that you may not be able to collect points.
    </p>
    <p>"Anybody with any questions at this point, raise your hand."
    </p>
    <p>Time was allowed for queries, and Horikita immediately raised her hand.
    </p>
    <p>"If the sales are the same, how are the classes ranked? What if, in a very extreme case, all the
        classes receive the same amount of 320000 points and are side by side?"
    </p>
    <p>Since the total amount is nicely divisible, it is not as if the case horikita just mentioned will not
        happen.
    </p>
    <p>Relying solely on chance, the odds of matching sales in all classes would be astronomical, but a
        secret agreement is not impossible. If all classes are treated as first place, everyone can equally
        raise class points.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that some sort of countermeasure would have been considered, but…

    </p>
    <p>
        "If the amount is the same, classes will be treated as the same rank. If all 12 classes make
        equal sales as Horikita says, all classes will get 100 class points as the first place."
    </p>
    <p>Is this a somewhat loose rule, given that you do not lose class points even if you lose?
    </p>
    <p>No. Maybe they've decided from the start that there won't be a large number of classes with the
        same amount of sales.
    </p>
    <p>"However, the total amount of sales can only be confirmed after the exam, and any manipulation
        of sales by a third party is not permitted. It is impossible for classes to discuss and make a plan
        to combine sales before the festival, or to make an agreement to divide the sales equally after
        the festival. You know what this means, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>If you can't control the sales amount later, it's unlikely that all classes will be ranked number one
        side by side.
    </p>
    <p>Above all, Classes are not likely to hold hands in a friendly manner without losing one valuable
        competitive opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't see how it's normal to have the same amount of sales and money. I don't think you need
        to worry about it."
    </p>
    <p>Not understanding the meaning of Horikita's question, Maezono voices her doubts.
    </p>
    <p>"As Maezono-san said, if you are working normally, you don't need to worry about it. But it is not
        a bad thing to know if it is accepted as a rule or not."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita's statement is also plausible. It is not a bad thing to know.
    </p>
    <p>If it is said that the agreement does not take place at all, it is unclear at present. This is because
        it is possible for certain grades and classes to collude to create side-by-side sales.
    </p>
    <p>There are numerous ways to accomplish this, but if the final sales amounts of all products to be
        manufactured ahead of time are aligned among the classes, it is quite simple to construct a
        scene in which sold-out = same amount.
    </p>
    <p>But we also need to be prepared for betrayal, unforeseen circumstances, and trouble.
    </p>
    <p>It would not be funny if we prioritized selling out above all else, and as a result, we ended up in
        the lower ranks in terms of sales.
    </p>
    <p>The hurdles to overcome in order to intentionally create a tie are much higher than one might
        imagine.
    </p>
    <p>"Anyone else with questions?"
    </p>
    <p>No one raised a hand after that, especially regarding the festival.
    </p>
    <p>"That's all I have to say about the cultural festival. Next, I would like to announce the results of
        the mid-term examinations for the second semester. This time, some of the students achieved
        results that surprised even me."
    </p>
    <p>The conversation moves on to the mid-term test and the announcement of its results.
    </p>
    <p>There are quite a few screaming voices from students who are not good at academics.
    </p>
    <p>Depending on how you look at it, 'Surprised' could mean a 'bad' result.
    </p>
    <p>However, given that Chabashira-sensei's expression is not dark and hard, that result seems
        unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>All at once, the names of the 38 students in the class are displayed, and they are lined up in
        order of highest overall score.
    </p>
    <p>Keisei took first place. His performance was flawless, and he received high marks in all
        subjects.
    </p>
    <p>In second place was Horikita, just slightly behind. It was comparable to Keisei, and the
        difference in overall points was only 3 points.
    </p>
    <p>From there, the names of the usual honors students line up, but the student whose results
        surprised Chabashira-sensei is surely the one who placed eleventh.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="center italic">
        11th - Ken Sudo.
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">73 points in Modern Japanese,
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">76 points in Chemistry,
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">70 points in Social Studies,
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">78 points in Mathematics, and
        70 points in English.
    </p>
    <p>
        367 overall with well-balanced scores in all subjects.
    </p>
    <p>The names above him in the rankings are honor students such as Yosuke, Kushida, Matsushita,
    </p>
    <p>and Wang. That is why Sudo's ranking was a surprise to everyone.
    </p>
    <p>Sudo's dedication to studying and working hard was well-known, but it was an unexpected turn
        of events that Sudo, who also devotes himself to club activities till late every day, would come
        out on top.
    </p>
    <p>"Seriously, Ken is in 11th place, that's amazing…"
    </p>
    <p>The honest, or rather stunned, response comes from Ike, who was almost side by side, or even
        on top at the start of school in the rankings.
    </p>
    <p>A leap beyond imagination. The difficulty level of this test was moderate, and the difference in
        the total score from Sudo to the 20th place below is only about 15 points, but still, this result
        must have astonished many.
    </p>
    <p>I expected him to run around with joy, but he only made a small gut-punch and did not seem to
        be bragging or making fun of others for having passed them.
    </p>
    <p>Confirming the latest updated OAA by operating the cell phone.

    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="center italic">
        Ken Sudo
        Academic ability C+,
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">Physical ability A+,
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">resourceful thinking C-,
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">social contribution D-.
    </p>
    <p class="italic center"></p>
    <p>
        Outstanding physical ability while maintaining a level close to the average as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, if he maintains his test scores, he can see himself in the vicinity of a B in academic
        performance in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>If he continues to refine his studies, it is likely that he will be able to achieve A or above in both
        academic and physical abilities. It seems that the efforts made over the past year are bearing
        fruit in more ways than one can imagine.
    </p>
    <p>Due to the decrease in problem behaviors in private life, the lowest level of social contribution
        has risen to D-. He is also above the rest and best in the OAA growth rate.
    </p>
    <p>By the way, my ranking is 14th. I'm in 14th place, which is lower than Sudo.
    </p>
    <p>I got a perfect score in mathematics, but I save it for the rest of the subjects.
    </p>
    <p>To say that this is me cutting corners would be an understatement, because in reality there is
        another aim.
    </p>
    <p>Showing up with an all perfect score on the mid-term test in the second semester will only cause
        unnecessary confusion.
    </p>
    <p>It is many times more important to make students like Sudo feel that they must grow and help
        the class, rather than reassure them that there are students who can achieve high scores.
    </p>
    <p>In fact, Sudo's 11th-place result has generated a wide range of emotions among his classmates.
    </p>
    <p>It's also something that almost all of them can only positively affect from.
    </p>
    <p>While some of the names are in the top ranks, others inevitably sink to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>These students are, for lack of a better word, regulars, yet when compared to the average
        scores of the other classes, it is evident that their performance has become better over time.
    </p>
    <p>More and more students are attempting to improve, albeit at a low level, and they seem to be
        steadily and gradually starting to show results.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, not all of them will be able to do as well as Sudo. Even when it comes to studying,
    </p>
    <p>there are differences in the amount of talent and knowledge that can be absorbed, and there are
        also large differences in dedication and physical strength.
    </p>
    <p>Above all, in Sudo's case, we must not forget that his motivation comes from his love for
        Horikita, who teaches and helps him to study.
    </p>
    <p>In any case, the competition had begun as a result of Airi's expulsion from the school, in order to
        avoid losing and to become competitive even at the lower ranks.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        In the Classroom, the same day after school.
    </p>
    <p>The main members gathered after everyone was said to leave.
    </p>
    <p>Sato, Matsushita, Mi-chan, and Maezono. What they have in common is that they are the
        creators of maid cafes.
    </p>
    <p>And then there are a total of six of us: including me and Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>Meetings about the maid cafe were mostly held over the phone after the initial presentation to
        avoid information leakage, but now that we had reached the point where we could finally begin
        determining the layout and location of the stall in earnest, it was necessary to hold detailed
        meetings in the special building that we actually planned to rent. The outside location was cut off
        first, given the concept and scale of the maid café.
    </p>
    <p>To put it another way, the place as classrooms has been fixed from the beginning, but the
        location of the stall is still in doubt to this day.
    </p>
    <p>Students from other grades and classes come daily to inspect and scout out potential stall
        locations.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, we had to be creative in our inspection so as not to narrow down which concept and
        classroom we were going to use. If it were true, it would be more effective to include boys such
        as Yosuke in the group, but unfortunately, he is busy with club activities at this time of the day,
    </p>
    <p>and having too many people in the group would also cause problems.
    </p>
    <p>As soon as we gathered together and started moving, Matsushita looked at Horikita and me and
        asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>"What are you going to do about Hasebe-san and Miyake-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>"What will we do? What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>"They come to school every day but won't talk to anyone. It means they continue to see us, the
        whole class, as the enemy."
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. Well, maybe mainly me."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka's best friend Airi was expelled and she was forced to expel her from school, which
        created a big barrier for her.
    </p>
    <p>Although they were able to come to school, they didn't break down that barrier.
    </p>
    <p>"Hasebe-san may be trying to take revenge on the class in the future."
    </p>
    <p>I don't think Matsushita was directly called or told by Haruka.
    </p>
    <p>But if you look at Haruka now and sense that atmosphere, someone like Matsushita would
        guess.
    </p>
    <p>"I guess you're probably right. But it's also true that so far we haven't seen any problematic
        behavior. She has been participating in the meetings for the festival."
    </p>
    <p>Because I made a proposal for a maid cafe at an early stage, Haruka knows the fact that we are
        planning to open a maid cafe in this cultural festival. There is no reason not to include her in the
        group.
    </p>
    <p>"Does that mean you condone revenge?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, of course not. I understand why she would be upset, but that doesn't mean I don't mind her
        bothering the class."
    </p>
    <p>These special exams cannot be avoided, there is no room for consideration as it can be treated
        as perfect evil.
    </p>
    <p>As for Horikita, I am sure she strongly hopes that Haruka will not be out of control.
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, but that's not the case here, where that kind of logic is going to work. It shouldn't take
        long."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita repeatedly directed her gaze toward me during this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>She seemed to be trying to draw out words from me while discussing it with the leader, Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>However, I did not give my own views at this point.
    </p>
    <p>It is certainly clear that Haruka is plotting revenge, but right now she is attending school, taking
        tests normally, and not engaging in any action or behavior to bother the class.
    </p>
    <p>Even if we don't know what will happen in the future, we can't question her at this stage.
    </p>
    <p>"There's very little you can do in advance. Lecturing to people to stop taking revenge will only
        get on their nerves. However…"
    </p>
    <p>"However?"
    </p>
    <p>"If she really is looking for an opportunity for revenge, she certainly won't put it off for months."
    </p>
    <p>I agree with that opinion.
    </p>
    <p>It is unlikely that she will continue to live her life at school maturely for the next six months or a
        year.
    </p>
    <p>To put it another way, the most concerning timing is ——
        "We can't rule out the possibility that she might do something at this festival."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, who probably wanted to hear those words, nodded quietly.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun said that Hasebe-san has no intention of working as a maid. So I gave her and
        Miyake-kun a general role while letting them know the situation. If we were to hide information
        from her or exclude her from the group, it would openly convey that we were suspicious of her."
    </p>
    <p>It's likely that the extinguished fire will start burning again if Horikita and the others do anything
        to degrade Haruka's side, even though they have no intention of seeking revenge.
    </p>
    <p>"So, It's about keeping them on your side, but avoiding giving them important roles."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, I figured I should do that just in case."
    </p>
    <p>Of course, you would not have strong concerns about them going rogue at a cultural festival.
    </p>
    <p>Still, as a leader, it is important to stay ahead of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>Many guests will come to the cultural festival. If bad things about Horikita's class spreads to the
        guests and they get a bad reputation, it will be no wonder that they may receive some kind of
        penalty.
    </p>
    <p>"I know you're probably wondering about Haruka and the others, but we're about to arrive."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita was so absorbed in the conversation that she did not realize that we were getting
        close to the destination.
    </p>
    <p>Many classes are still wondering where to set up their stalls.
    </p>
    <p>You never know what place might be picked up.
    </p>
    <p>There are a total of eight classrooms that can be opened in the special building, with three
        floors. We are currently on the third floor of the building, and the cost is gradually increasing in
        stages the closer you are to the stairs by the entrance. The third floor can be rented for 10,000
        to 13,000 points, while the first floor can be rented for 50,000 points. This difference of almost
        40,000 points can be used to purchase food and other necessities.
    </p>
    <p>The number of points allotted to a class are limited. It's unavoidable that you'll be concerned
        about how much money to set aside for the cost of the stall location and how to pay for other
        expenses.
    </p>
    <p>"It's a lot farther than I thought it would be."
    </p>
    <p>Mi-chan's first impression was still about distance.
    </p>
    <p>I think Everyone will agree on that.
    </p>
    <p>"What do you think, Sato-san?"
    </p>
    <p>Mi-chan asks Sato, who hasn't spoken up yet today, but she doesn't react right away.
    </p>
    <p>"Sato-san?"
    </p>
    <p>Once again, this time when approached at close range, Sato hurriedly replied.
    </p>
    <p>"Ah, uh. I wondered if it was far away… …Yep, I also thought."
    </p>
    <p>"Unless we have a pretty good showing, I don't think most people will make a trip this far."
    </p>
    <p>We did not stay long on the third floor, which is a lower priority, perhaps because everyone's
        opinions are generally the same.
    </p>
    <p>Then we all came down to the second floor.
    </p>
    <p>"It would be preferable to be on the second floor rather than the third. More specifically, I'd say
        the first floor is great."
    </p>
    <p>Maezono mutters while looking at the outside scenery from the window.
    </p>
    <p>"I agree. But... the first floor is still quite pricey, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>Mi-chan makes a troubled face as she stares at her cell phone.
    </p>
    <p>"But we have to make a decision soon. It's getting pretty full."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita mentions this while looking at Mi-chan's cell phone.
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. Two of the five places we picked up are filled up... However, the fact that there are
        still candidates from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor is the point of concern."
    </p>
    <p>Pay high points for convenience, or abandon convenience and settle by paying low points.
    </p>
    <p>"I still think it should be on the first floor. It will be a disadvantage if we can't get people to go
        upstairs because they're interrupted and distracted by other exhibits and stalls along the way."
    </p>
    <p>"Whether it's on the second or third floor, if we can make people want to come, I don't think it
        matters greatly."
    </p>
    <p>Maezono, Mi-chan, and Matsushita discuss with each other.
    </p>
    <p>Sato, who is always enthusiastic and often talks over others, has been quiet since a while ago.
    </p>
    <p>Her friends occasionally look at her as if they are concerned about her, but she seems
        distracted and absent minded.
    </p>
    <p>"She's been like that lately, Sato-san."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita noticed that I was concerned about her, and quietly told me what I wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>"Come to think of it, she may not be feeling particularly well for the last few days."
    </p>
    <p>"I thought Ayanokoji-kun might know something about it, but I guess not."
    </p>
    <p>Does Matsushita think I am an esupā or something?
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note — 'esupā' also known as esper (plural espers) is A person who practices the
        development of psychic ability, or has psychic abilities. ]
        Or it may have been a statement made in anticipation of Kei's close relationship with Sato, but
        either way, I do not have detailed information.
    </p>
    <p>"I asked her if she was having any issues, but she didn't mention anything specific."
    </p>
    <p>"Sometimes people just want to be left alone, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, but somehow I don't think that's what it's about this time."
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>As Matsushita continues, I wonder if she has any idea about it, and we continue without cutting
        off the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>"She wants to talk, but she can't. She's the type of person who keeps things inside that she
        doesn't like."
    </p>
    <p>I guess after a year and a half of friendship, you can even tell that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>"She can't just keep it bottled up inside and be done with it, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's, well… she generally consults with me."
    </p>
    <p>"If so, we will probably have to wait and see. If you are right, she will come to you for advice in
        the not-too-distant future, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"...Maybe."
    </p>
    <p>Although she seemed somewhat unsettled, Matsushita quietly withdrew, as this type of lengthy
        conversation was not something that we could have in the presence of Sato.
    </p>
    <p>I am somewhat concerned about the absent-minded attitude, but the first priority is to decide
        where to open the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>After the inspection of the second floor, we were about to move to the first floor when we
        encountered a small number of people from other group.
    </p>
    <p>"Yo! Ayanokoji. Are you looking for a place to open a stall for the school festival?"
    </p>
    <p>It was Hashimoto of the 2nd year A class who called out to me. Shortly thereafter, the leader,
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi, also showed up, along with Kamuro.
    </p>
    <p>If all three of them are moving together then it can't be just a trivial walk.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know. Maybe it's already decided, or maybe they haven't even decided if they want it
        indoors or outdoors."
    </p>
    <p>"No decision? That's an easy lie to see through. You're taking Horikita and the others to wander
        around the special building for no reason? Tell me about the kind of stall you're going to put on."
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi does not join the conversation, but watches with a wry smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>"It's no use asking him. He's not in a position to keep track of everything in the class."
    </p>
    <p>Unable to listen in silence, Horikita intervenes and interrupts the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>"So you're just enjoying your harem?"
    </p>
    <p>He points out that I am the only male of the six people and asks Kamuro to agree.
    </p>
    <p>"You must be similar, Hashimoto-kun. With Sakayanagi-san and Kamuro-san. You are the only
        boy in the group, even if the number of people in the group is different. Now are you aware that
        you're the only one who makes these strange remarks?"
    </p>
    <p>Horikita goes so far to respond at the same level, showing a relaxed response.
    </p>
    <p>Ippon was taken, but that doesn't mean that Hashimoto, one way or another, won't do anything
        about it.
    </p>
    <p>[TL Note — Ippon (一本, "one full point") is the highest score a fighter can achieve in a
        Japanese martial arts. Here referencing that Horikita sort of k.o. Hashimoto.]
        Instead, he changed the subject as if the current conversation never happened.
    </p>
    <p>"Sato and Matsushita, and Wang and Maezono. You guys talk a lot at school these days."
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto turned his gaze on the four maid cafe creators.
    </p>
    <p>While the three were bracing themselves, Matsushita stepped forward in the same manner as
        usual.
    </p>
    <p>"You can't and it's no good to try to get anything out of us."
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder if you understood it."
    </p>
    <p>The two girls went hard at Hashimoto, with Matsushita joining Horikita's glare.
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't mean it that way. No, really. It's just…"
    </p>
    <p>The implied tone of the statement is disturbing to all except me.
    </p>
    <p>"Oops, I wonder if I said anything unnecessary?"
    </p>
    <p>Grinning, Hashimoto looked over to Sakayanagi for the first time here.
    </p>
    <p>You don't mind if I talk , do you? It seems as if he is asking this question.
    </p>
    <p>"You seem to have something to say, Hashimoto-kun."
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, standing guard over the three girls, asked in a somewhat irritated voice.
    </p>
    <p>As if he had been waiting for those words, his expressions were sparked on.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm worried about your cultural festival. It looks like you and Ryuen got along well in the sports
        festival, but do you really think you can trust him forever?"
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>"As he is. He pretends to be an ally, but he will not be afraid to stab you in the back."
    </p>
    <p>"A sports festival is a sports festival, a cultural festival is a cultural festival. Sakayanagi's class is
        an enemy to be defeated, as well as Ryuen's class. How can we trust them?"
    </p>
    <p>"I hope so. I just thought you were going to team up with Ryuen again."
    </p>
    <p>If you do, be careful. He indirectly said, like a grandmother to her grandchild.
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita must have sensed the hints and the hidden meaning behind the words.
    </p>
    <p>She was tempted to ask him if he knew something, but Matsushita held her herself.
    </p>
    <p>"We're in a hurry, and I don't think we can play word games forever. Right? Guys."
    </p>
    <p>He turned around and looked as if to ask the girls and me to agree.
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. Let's go, it's a waste of time talking here."
    </p>
    <p>"You really hate me, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto lets out a deliberate sigh at Kamuro, who spoiled the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe. I just asked it or heard it somehow... Well, good luck with that."
    </p>
    <p>In the end, Sakayanagi didn't say a word and went into the classroom where we had been
        looking earlier.
    </p>
    <p>"It was a little scary…"
    </p>
    <p>Relieved, Mi-chan patted her chest and muttered to Sato, who stood to her left.
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? Oh, um, yeah. It was Sort of."
    </p>
    <p>Whether she was listening or not, Sato's attitude was unnatural here as well.
    </p>
    <p>"Let's just move on."
    </p>
    <p>If you stand here and talk, you might soon run into Class A again.
    </p>
    <p>We all wanted to avoid that, so we decided to look for another potential site.
    </p>
    <p>"What Hashimoto-kun said earlier... Won't we get in trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>Maezono says briefly.
    </p>
    <p>As we were preparing for the maid cafe, I and Horikita informed only these members of the
        group ahead of time. They must have been surprised and became anxious.
    </p>
    <p>"It's been confirmed that you and Ryuen's class will cooperate with each other at the upcoming
        festival, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. When we cooperated with each other for the sports festival, we also obtained permission
        from Ryuen-kun's side."
    </p>
    <p>Making Stalls that do not overlap with each other.
    </p>
    <p>If the stalls are similar or in competition with each other, then avoiding each other with the
        location of the store.
    </p>
    <p>Being able to efficiently replace, temporarily lending, or follow up personnel.
    </p>
    <p>Although it is a small arrangement, it is an agreement to prepare for unforeseen circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't mind it so much because the sports festival went so well, but when you say something
        like that, it makes me nervous, and I wonder if we can really trust them."
    </p>
    <p>"I am not sure if I can trust Ryuen-kun personally. That's why I brought Katsuragi-kun into the
        discussion. I think it will be all right."
    </p>
    <p>"I want to believe it, too. But didn't Hashimoto-kun seem to know something?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, I felt it, too. Even if they don't betray us, it's conceivable that they're leaking the fact that
        we're working together."
    </p>
    <p>"The ones who know are me and Ayanokoji-kun. Then there are the four of you who started up
        the maid cafe. From Ryuen's class is Katsuragi-kun. He may have told some of his other major
        classmates, but there is no merit in leaking it."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita explains that it is hard to imagine information being leaked.
    </p>
    <p>"I agree with Horikita. I think it was unexpected that Horikita and Ryuen joined forces to defeat A
        class at the sports festival. We're cautious for the next one. Also There may be similar contacts
        and probes in the future, but you shouldn't worry about it."
    </p>
    <p>I followed up casually.
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, I see. I understand."
    </p>
    <p>Maezono and Mi-chan nodded their heads, and Matsushita and Sato also reaffirmed.
    </p>
    <p>Afterwards, we returned to the classroom and gathered to make a final judgment.
    </p>
    <p>"I'd like to take a majority vote among the members here on where we would like to open the
        store. May I?"
    </p>
    <p>"What if the opinions are evenly split?"
    </p>
    <p>"We'll think about that then. Let's try it once first. Rock for the first floor, Paper for the second
        floor, and Scissor for the third floor. Okay?"
    </p>
    <p>Mi-chan recites in a whisper, perhaps to avoid confusion, and then looks at the palm of her
        hand.
    </p>
    <p>"Ready. Let's go . 1, 2…"
    </p>
    <p>The six of us, including myself, all expressed our decisions with our hands at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>The results at a glance are — 4 rocks, 2 paper and 0 Scissors.
    </p>
    <p>The third floor was excluded because of the hassle involved in getting to the third floor.
    </p>
    <p>I chose to take 'paper' for the sake of keeping the initial cost down, but it would not be a bad
        choice to choose the first floor for its convenience. The other 'paper' was Matsushita.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, this is a step forward because the idea to choose the first floor has been decided.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll apply right away. There are still a lot of classes that are being looked at, and it would be
        troublesome if they were taken."
    </p>
    <p>Using her cell phone, Horikita immediately began working on an application to hold the first
        floor.
    </p>
    <p>"Are we done for the day?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, I need to talk to you about something first."
    </p>
    <p>I have been gathering information about maid cafes in my own way until recently.
    </p>
    <p>I should mention that.
    </p>
    <p>"The maid cafe's main target is men. Many of the guests at the festival are families, but basically
        we are targeting male customers."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't think there will be any female customers at all, but in terms of percentage, there will be a
        considerable difference."
    </p>
    <p>This is what everyone thinks from the general image, without needing to do any research.
    </p>
    <p>"There also exists a butler cafe, the opposite of a maid cafe. It's not the maid girls who serve
        there, but the men dressed as butlers."
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps Matsushita and her colleagues had not heard of this information before, but they
        seemed impressed and surprised.
    </p>
    <p>"Maids and butlers are a type of concept cafe. Aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>"...You are also familiar with this stuff, Horikita."
    </p>
    <p>"I at least gather information. It can be decided if it's useful or not after learning it."
    </p>
    <p>I would say that is an ideal example of this.
    </p>
    <p>"Then we can move on. The most important and indispensable thing is a sense of cleanliness. I
        think that when holding a classroom in a special building, not only the floor you are on but also
        that area should be taken into consideration."
    </p>
    <p>Each classroom is used very differently normally.
    </p>
    <p>"Floors, walls, ceilings, and other chairs also show small variation in damage over time. We
        want to check for that as well."
    </p>
    <p>"That's important. Even if we clean up after ourselves to some extent, there are some areas we
        can't do anything about. The cleaner it is, the better it is for the restaurant."
    </p>
    <p>Everyone in the room agrees, and begins to look around the classroom again.
    </p>
    <p>Consciousness, previously directed only toward convenience of the first floor and the outside
        scene, began to change.
    </p>
    <p>"And as for the uniforms, we must not push the eroticism too far."
    </p>
    <p>"What? What did you say...?"
    </p>
    <p>"Eroticism. Eros and eroticism have been considered important elements in art since ancient
        times. Showing underwear and the like is out of the question, but it is also important not to turn
        down the hope that it might be visible."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, too, looked stunned, as if she had not thought about this.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, Ayanokoji-kun. Aren't you getting awfully knowledgeable?"
    </p>
    <p>"As long as I'm in charge of running a maid cafe, of course I can't cut corners,I studied with as
        much help as possible."
    </p>
    <p>It was also encouraging that there were several students in the class who were strong on this
        type of topic. Of course, I avoided explicitly mentioning that Horikita's class had a maid cafe,
    </p>
    <p>and approached them on the assumption that I was personally interested.
    </p>
    <p>But It was also a little distressing that some of the students who mistakenly thought I had
        awakened to Otaku tendered me an unusual degree of hospitality and teaching, saying that they
        did not want anything in return if it would increase the number of like-minded people and
        comrades.
    </p>
    <p>"Can I continue?"
    </p>
    <p>"Um, yeah, go ahead…"
    </p>
    <p>No one seemed to stop me, so I continued to talk about what a maid is like for a while.
    </p>
    <p>It is important for those who actually wear maid clothes to know this.
    </p>
    <p>Then It will also be possible to respond consciously to customers.
    </p>
    <p>"Then I thought about a sales strategy. In addition to providing food and beverages, we will sell
        the right to take pictures, called Cheki. We will use a specialized camera and charge 800 points
        for a photo of one maid. For a photo session with a customer, we set the price at 1,200 points.
    </p>
    <p>In order to reduce costs, I proposed to use a printer to print out the photos after taking them with
        a cell phone, but this was rejected by the professor who taught me the method. He said, 'If you
        neglect quality for profit, no one will want to look at it'."
    </p>
    <p>[TL Note — Cheki are pictures with a small instant camera that gives you pics instantly.]
        If well utilized, Cheki sales can be as good as the food menu.
    </p>
    <p>"But you also have to worry about stock, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, I'm optimistic about the pictures. I have a plan to sell out. Of course, the photos will not be
        made public. Also, under the leadership of Horikita, the construction of the stalls led by the boys
        has started. That food should also be linked to the maid cafe. "
    </p>
    <p>When I finished speaking, Horikita was silent for a moment and then added one cough.
    </p>
    <p>"The competition is inevitably high for restaurants because of the signs of multiple installations,
    </p>
    <p>including other grades. So we'll specialize in snacks while keeping prices low."
    </p>
    <p>"But that doesn't make much money, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. That's right. So it's a stepping stone to the maid cafe, which is our main goal. Buyers will
        be given a half-price ticket for one drink that can be used at the maid cafe."
    </p>
    <p>We need to make people aware of maid cafe, and then we need to get them to visit the special
        building. We need to advertise outdoors and have a channel to direct them to ensure they reach
        the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        After the meeting for the maid cafe was over, I went to the Keyaki Mall.
    </p>
    <p>This is because I am conducting a price survey of ingredients today.
    </p>
    <p>Both things offered online and those sold in the mall fall under this category. The ability to
        produce quality food for the least amount of money is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>If I invited Kei, it would turn into a date instead of a research, so I would do it alone today.
    </p>
    <p>On the way to the supermarket, I found a man staring at a map of the building.
    </p>
    <p>I was a little bothered by his rather grim face, so I decided to talk to him.
    </p>
    <p>"You were the center of attention today, Sudo."
    </p>
    <p>He seemed a little shocked when he turned around to face me and as if he hadn't seen me until
        I was near.
    </p>
    <p>"Eh? Oh Ayanokoji? What do you mean, the center of attention?"
    </p>
    <p>"I’m talking about the midterms."
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, you mean that? I'm glad to hear that, I guess I got what I expected given the amount of
        studying I did."
    </p>
    <p>Apparently, after the midterm, he even graded himself in detail.
    </p>
    <p>"It would be surprising thinking what you were when you first entered school."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sure you're right. I'm sure my past self would be yelling at me, "What's the use of studying
        and learning words and formulas, you should practice basketball more instead of wasting your
        time like that."
    </p>
    <p>Sudo replied, imagining himself in the past.
    </p>
    <p>I wanted to ask one question to Sudo, so I decided to ask.
    </p>
    <p>"If your past self did actually tell you, ‘Don't waste your time.’ What would you say back?"
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? Well…"
    </p>
    <p>After thinking for a moment, Sudo put his own answer into words.
    </p>
    <p>"What are you supposed to be if you can't even remember words and formulas...?' Or
        something like that?
    </p>
    <p>It's a wonderful return, but it's also true that the old Sudo wasn't someone specializing in only
        one area.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to become a professional basketball player, so it doesn't matter,"
    </p>
    <p>he would reply.
    </p>
    <p>"Ummm, sure...! I will say——What's the right response in that case? A professional who can
        play it smart is better than a professional who can't play it smart... I'm not sure. It's a little tricky
        when you can't reason with…"
    </p>
    <p>Sudo laughs bitterly as he racks his brains.
    </p>
    <p>"To be honest, I'm getting impatient since it's getting a little more difficult to understand. Up until
        now, once I got the hang of it, it went pretty smoothly…"
    </p>
    <p>Sudo, who has been working really hard to make up for his academic shortcomings, appeared
        nervous and impatient. It appeared as though someone had begun again at the elementary
        school level, or in Sudo's case, junior high. Did he understand he's in a still position now that
        he's caught up to the typical second-year high school student?
    </p>
    <p>Despite being proud of his 11th place finish this time, which is higher than half of the class, I fear
        that the momentum will stall at this point. It won't just be a matter of adding more study time
        from this point forward. More complex factors likely need to be considered in addition to effort,
    </p>
    <p>comprehension, efficiency, and talent.
    </p>
    <p>"Anyways, what’s up? What did you want from me?"
    </p>
    <p>"Nothing in particular, I was just a little curious. Aren't you supposed to be at club activities
        today?"
    </p>
    <p>I wondered why Sudo had come to Keyaki Mall at this hour of the day. Club activities still
        continued even though the cultural event was drawing near.
    </p>
    <p>"I had to take some time off today."
    </p>
    <p>"That's unusual."
    </p>
    <p>At a quick glance, he doesn't seem to be in bad shape.
    </p>
    <p>"I just had another problem…"
    </p>
    <p>"Another problem?"
    </p>
    <p>"Lately, my eyesight’s been deteriorating to the point where I'm aware of it."
    </p>
    <p>He said and stared off into the distance.
    </p>
    <p>"I've always had a clear 20/20 vision since I was a little kid, but lately it's been strange."
    </p>
    <p>Sudo's physical and mental conditions were thus being negatively impacted by his commitment
        to his academics.
    </p>
    <p>Eyesight is crucial for an athlete. His play would likely suffer if his eyesight were to deteriorate in
        the future.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, glasses or contact lenses can greatly compensate for this, but even so, good
        eyesight is better than nothing.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm looking for an optician to measure my eyesight. I've never been to one before, and I was
        wondering where it was."
    </p>
    <p>So that's why he's been staring at a guide map.
    </p>
    <p>If you're feeling a strong sense that your eyesight is declining, there's a good chance that your
        eyesight is actually deteriorating.
    </p>
    <p>"Even if my eyesight keeps deteriorating in the future, I will continue to study. I'm not going to
        stop playing basketball because I love it so much, but... I'm starting to think that it might be okay
        to have other options while I dream of becoming a pro."
    </p>
    <p>"Other options?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't laugh, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"I won’t."
    </p>
    <p>"I thought I could go to a normal university and continue my studies, and even if I could force my
        way into the pros because of my academics, there's no way they'd use me in the sports world if
        I'm not good enough. If that's the case, then I can get into the university I want to go to and do
        my best."
    </p>
    <p>The study that started with horikita has brought about a big change in Sudo's way of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>"You can go to university and become a professional after graduation, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, that's right."
    </p>
    <p>It's not that one has to branch off the path to a profession from high school.
    </p>
    <p>Sudo had previously only considered the route from high school graduate to professional, but
        now he has considered the possibility of continuing on to college. His own path will also be
        divided up more.
    </p>
    <p>"Ah."
    </p>
    <p>Sudo noticed something out of the corner of his eye..
    </p>
    <p>I also turned my gaze to the sight of Akito and Haruka’s backs.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not a date, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe."
    </p>
    <p>If you just look at the back from a distance, it will only look like a couple is walking.
    </p>
    <p>But everyone in class knows exactly what kind of state the two are in now.
    </p>
    <p>"Can we really just leave them alone?"
    </p>
    <p>"It wouldn’t matter if we told them anything now anyways."
    </p>
    <p>"That may be the case."
    </p>
    <p>Sudo clenched his fists, his teeth grinding.
    </p>
    <p>"I wasn't particularly close to Sakura, but I've had a similar experience."
    </p>
    <p>Sudo used to hang out with Yamauchi so frequently that he and Ike with Yamauchi were once
        referred to as the three idiots.
    </p>
    <p>Yamauchi's expulsion may have hurt him more than usual because of this.
    </p>
    <p>"But I guess it's nothing compared to what I was like back then. I couldn't even go so far as to
        say that I would expel myself in his place."
    </p>
    <p>For Haruka, it seemed like her school life was equal in value, or even more so, to Airi’s.
    </p>
    <p>"If you have any trouble, you can always tell me. Well, I'm sure you don't need my help,
    </p>
    <p>Ayanokoji."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't think so. If I ever need to talk to you about something, I won't hesitate to do so."
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, then I will be going for now. See you later, Ayanokoji."
    </p>
    <p>I bid Sudo farewell and walked towards the supermarket.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        The next morning, I met up with Kei downstairs in the dormitory.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry Kiyotaka, have you been waiting?"
    </p>
    <p>"Not really, shall we go then?"
    </p>
    <p>Kei, who was standing beside me, took my hand without any hesitation and we started to walk.
    </p>
    <p>The act of holding hands and walking side by side like this was not uncommon any more.
    </p>
    <p>"Yesterday... Thanks for staying up with me until late. I'm very happy."
    </p>
    <p>Kei squeezed my hand while blushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>"But it'd be a problem if we get caught."
    </p>
    <p>Although already past the curfew, Kei kept staying in my room last night. Fortunately, there
        seemed to be no witnesses when she left, so we would not be penalized.
    </p>
    <p>"Ahaha, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>For some reason, Kei's profile looked reliable. Can she change this much in half a day?
    </p>
    <p>"Did it hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>"...do you even have to ask?"
    </p>
    <p>"Is it that bad?"
    </p>
    <p>"No, but... how do I put this, I thought I was used to it."
    </p>
    <p>Even though blushing, Kei was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>"In a way, it was my first time so I had probably hadn't sorted my mind yet. However, I feel
        reassured that Kiyotaka was there for me all the time and did not care about the curfew."
    </p>
    <p>That's true, who knows what would have happened if I hadn't been there.
    </p>
    <p>Kei had taken a step up toward the stairs of adulthood after yesterday's experience. Although
        she had support behind her back, she had succeeded in standing with her hands off the ground.
    </p>
    <p>It was a long rehabilitation from the point where she thought she could never stand anymore.
    </p>
    <p>Learning to get up on your own when you fall was important for Kei, a special case that didn't
        happen overnight like other students. It could be said that the prospect was finally here.
    </p>
    <p>"G-Good morning, Kei-chan."
    </p>
    <p>As soon as we arrived at the classroom, Sato, who had arrived early, spotted Kei and got up
        before running to her.
    </p>
    <p>"Good morning, Maya ~"
    </p>
    <p>Kei excused herself with her gaze to me and then immediately started talking to Sato in close
        proximity.
    </p>
    <p>Despite the initial awkwardness, they soon started their routine small talk, or perhaps it was
        even nicer than normal. Even students who aren't generally involved, like Shinohara and
        Mii-chan, who have been having difficulties for a while, started to feel the circle of happiness
        that started with the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, who has gradually begun to show her strength as a leader, is awakening the skills to
        unite the large, but it is different. The ability to create, attract, and unite a small group. Without a
        doubt, Kei has the right qualities and characteristics to do so.
    </p>
    <p>These matters, which are crucial for strengthening the class, appeared to be progressing
        smoothly on the way to the festival, but suddenly news of an incident with the potential to cause
        a significant issue emerged.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, is it true that our class is going to have a maid cafe?"
    </p>
    <p>It all started when Ike burst into the classroom, shouting that as soon as he opened his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>Since this was a thing that had been kept a secret from everyone but a few students, Maezono
        stood up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>The people who came up with the idea, such as Sato, Matsushita, and Mii-chan, all looked at
        each other.
    </p>
    <p>Only some of the girls who are currently confirmed to participate as staff members and those
        who are approached are informed about the maid cafe. Then there is Horikita, who organizes
        the festival.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita patiently listened to Ike's story without getting agitated. If she behaved inappropriately, it
        would be obvious to the entire class that they were truly planning to have a maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>And it would also be exposed to the other classes.
    </p>
    <p>But the way Maezono and the others reacted to Ike's original question, that aspect was
        removed. It was quite doubtful that he was just making it up randomly since he said it was a
        maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>"Where did you hear this, Ike-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>"Where did I hear? Well uh…"
    </p>
    <p>Ike, frightened by Maezono's stiff, angry
        look, chokes on his words.
    </p>
    <p>"Just now, in the lobby, Ishizaki, Suzuki... and Nomura, the three of them were talking about it as
        loud as they could."
    </p>
    <p>"Hey Horikita-san, what does he mean? It was still supposed to be a secret, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Matsushita, who remembered the contact from Hashimoto, approached us.
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. I thought it was unthinkable, but I guess I was naive."
    </p>
    <p>The answer was clear when Ishizaki and the others were making a fuss.
    </p>
    <p>"Does this mean that Ryuen-kun betrayed us after all? You said it was okay, Horikita-san?"
    </p>
    <p>As Maezono angrily confronted Horikita, the classroom door opened and Sudo came in, looking
        a little agitated.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey! Ryuen and the others are coming this way."
    </p>
    <p>"... I guess I'll just have to greet them. You guys stay inside the classroom."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita got up from her seat and made the decision to meet Ryuen in the hallway, reasoning
        that the conversation would become problematic if an outsider joined them.
    </p>
    <p>"Yo, Did you come all the way to meet me? Suzune"
    </p>
    <p>Ishizaki, Albert, and Kaneda followed Ryuen, who was in the front.
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder What are you doing with these noisy students?"
    </p>
    <p>"I have something to tell you guys today. Hey, Ishizaki?"
    </p>
    <p>"Ugh…"
    </p>
    <p>Ishizaki looked around the room with a slightly nervous look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>The Students who were instructed not to leave the class were also present, either because of
        curiosity or an inability to resist.
    </p>
    <p>Maezono, in particular, was glaring at Ryuen without hiding her annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>"I guess your morning's fuss was well received by these guys."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen, sensing the mood, replied with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm honestly surprised. You really don't mind doing things that you don't anticipate."
    </p>
    <p>"Kuku, predictable behavior is boring"
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen began to explain carefully so that Ike and the others, who hadn't grasped the situation,
    </p>
    <p>could understand.
    </p>
    <p>"At Suzune’s proposal, your class and I formed a cooperative relationship at the sports festival.
    </p>
    <p>And we were planning to join forces early on for this year's cultural festival as well."
    </p>
    <p>To be precise, the request for cooperation in the cultural festival was made on my initiative, but it
        is an insignificant matter here.
    </p>
    <p>Then, Horikita and Katsuragi summarized everything and agreed to continue working together
        at the school festival.
    </p>
    <p>"We were supposed to make sure that the contents of our Stalls do not conflict with each other.
    </p>
    <p>Discussing stall locations. Being able to lend and borrow students and follow up with them as
        needed. Was that correct?"
    </p>
    <p>"That’s correct. We were planning to follow up with everyone a little further down the road. We
        were told early on about the content of the stalls and yesterday about the location."
    </p>
    <p>Kaneda smirked as he added details.
    </p>
    <p>"You were planning to betray us from the beginning, but you hid it from us until today because
        you were waiting for us to figure out where we were going to open the store."
    </p>
    <p>"That's what I'm talking about. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to renegotiate our agreement to
        cooperate."
    </p>
    <p>"That's a pretty big demand for a fresh start. You found out the location of our stall and
        thoughtlessly even revealed our exhibit."
    </p>
    <p>"Revealed? Ishizaki was simply chit-chatting with his friends. Unfortunately, your class and the
        other classes happened to overhear them. They were pretty impolite to listen in, don't you
        think?"
    </p>
    <p>Everyone in class slowly began to understand the situation.
    </p>
    <p>"Is what you just said true, Horikita-san?"
    </p>
    <p>The ongoing cooperative relationship with the Ryuen class, which even Yosuke had not yet
        informed of, asked horikita about it.
    </p>
    <p>"I was going to tell you when everything was finalized…"
    </p>
    <p>The plan was nearly in the final stage, but it was turned upside down at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>Classmates, including Yosuke, were just now informed by this scenario.
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder why, so I'll ask just in case? What's the benefit in betraying us? Did you team up with
        Sakayanagi-san, or Ichinose-san?"
    </p>
    <p>"I helped you in the sports festival with the aim of destroying the A class. But you guys won your
        way to the top, and you got a good taste of the action, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>We both picked up wins in the sports festival, but we were 100 points ahead
        in class points as a result.
    </p>
    <p>"We were on equal terms. The same goes for the cultural festival proposal."
    </p>
    <p>"But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if we crush class A, if you B's rise to the same
        position. It won't win us many class points, but we'll win the next festival. We'll have the same
        concept as you guys."
    </p>
    <p>"Does that mean a maid cafe?"
    </p>
    <p>It was Maezono who immediately responded to the keyword 'same'.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I'll change the concept a little but it will be something similar."
    </p>
    <p>It’s not so important if the event is leaked.
    </p>
    <p>However, Our planners and classmates must have known that if they employ the same idea on
        the same stage, it would be a deadly blow to Horikita's class.
    </p>
    <p>1st to 4th place. It was a declaration to compete for one of four seats to get 100 class points.
    </p>
    <p>"You really mean you're going to make an extra effort to compete in the same genre market? It
        doesn't seem like it would help you in any way."
    </p>
    <p>"Sure, it's probably riskier than the other ideas when it comes to competing for customers. But
        so what? We have a plan to outsell you and get to the top."
    </p>
    <p>I don't get Ryuen’s logic behind coming all the way here to tell us so.
    </p>
    <p>"So, let's have a more intense competition, Suzune."
    </p>
    <p>"Intense competition?"
    </p>
    <p>"So, let's have some more intense game, Suzune.
    </p>
    <p>"... game?"
    </p>
    <p>As the ruckus grew a little louder, Ryuen's declaration of war was heard by Kanzaki and other
        unrelated students from different classes.
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto was watching this somewhat amusedly, probably because he learned of
        this fact before Horikita’s class learned of it.
    </p>
    <p>"Whoever earns even one point more than the other gets five million points from the other class.
    </p>
    <p>Wouldn't that be an interesting match?
    </p>
    <p>"Are you really serious? I don't think it's a very sane stake."
    </p>
    <p>"If you ask me, it's only 5 million points."
    </p>
    <p>Class points cannot be moved.
    </p>
    <p>However, private points owned by individuals can be freely handled.
    </p>
    <p>He proposed the 'bet' because of this.
    </p>
    <p>This was a one-on-one proposal, separate from the 12-class competition.
    </p>
    <p>Even if you don't take the top rank in the cultural festival and lose, as long as you win the direct
        confrontation you would get 5 million private points, it would certainly be an intense game.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I really wanted to have a more expensive battle with a different opponent, but Nagumo,
    </p>
    <p>the student council president, said he would not be involved in the festival this time and ran
        away. The third-year students, except for the A class, are not interested in the festival. So, It
        didn't look like he was running away, but as long as I couldn't find an opponent, there was
        nothing I could do. Let's have a showdown in the second year."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't decide this on your own. I'm not going to accept such a reckless proposal."
    </p>
    <p>"Are you going to run away too?"
    </p>
    <p>"You broke the contract, leaked it, and then tried to weasel your way out of it. That's an
        impossible proposition. I can finally see Katsuragi-kun's true intentions in avoiding a penalty
        agreement."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't care about that anymore. Aren't you sure you can win this fight with me?"
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't say that."
    </p>
    <p>"Ha?"
    </p>
    <p>"I am not going to stand idly by and let you do whatever you want. I will positively consider the
        bet you proposed."
    </p>
    <p>"Kukuku, so you say. I’ll be waiting for your answer, Suzune."
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps having finished his business with us, Ryuen pulled away as if satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>As he turned around, his group followed and the others made way for them.
    </p>
    <p>As Ryuen and the others left, students from other classes, who had been spectators, began to
        approach.
    </p>
    <p>In the midst of all this, Hashimoto's eyes met mine, and he smiled thinly and shrugged his
        shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>It was as if to say, "Do you understand that we are joining forces with Ryuen?" He seemed to be
        trying to say that.
    </p>
    <p>This will already be known to the entire second grade and to all grades.
    </p>
    <p>The maid cafes, including Ryuen's surprise entry into the competition, were placed in a difficult
        environment.
    </p>
    <p>If some other classes were considering the same thing, I would not be surprised if they are now
        changing course.
    </p>
    <p>But we have already started a lot of preliminary work.
    </p>
    <p>"What are you going to do, Horikita-san? We're pretty well prepared, aren't we..?"
    </p>
    <p>"Is Ryuen really going to make a maid cafe?"
    </p>
    <p>Maezono and the others approached Horikita with their concerns and the frustration they were
        trying to hide.
    </p>
    <p>"I believe it’s very likely. I don't think it's just a threat."
    </p>
    <p>"How about we shift to a different concept now?"
    </p>
    <p>Yosuke suggests that they should consider that option in order to turn things around…
        "We can't do that. Part of the budget’s already invested."
    </p>
    <p>We've already ordered as much as we could for the maid's uniforms and so on.
    </p>
    <p>The money we have already spent on costs cannot be wasted. We would be wasting precious
        funds if we stopped. With our time being shorter, we need to reconsider how we will go around
        in the future.
    </p>
    <p>It can be said that we have fallen into a state of sunk cost bias.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : sankukosutobaiasu (サンクコストバイアス) mentioned in the sentence here is
        Sunk-Cost Fallacy. If you want, you can read about it here. ]
        "We have to rather take advantage of this situation, Even if it's not 5 million points, let's take the
        bet and turn it into an opportunity to earn a lot of private points."
    </p>
    <p>That is, of course, if the classmates accept this suggestion. Because the entire class would
        need to work together to raise the money in order to have a significant amount available.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        Apparently, it is unknown until the day of the event which class will open what store, at what
        location and what will they present. However, there are examples like Horikita's Class which
        was exposed by betrayal.
    </p>
    <p>But the bigger the scale, the more preparation needs to begin in advance for the day.
    </p>
    <p>In fact, each class was gradually starting to move in at the various points where they were
        anticipated to have stalls.
    </p>
    <p>In the midst of all this, unexpected information came to light from the 3rd year A class led by
        Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>As if they had no intention of hiding it from the start, rumours spread that they were planning to
        rent out a sizable gymnasium space and stage an exhibit that mixed a "haunted house" with a
        "maze."
    </p>
    <p>It can be described as the style of a person who doesn't have to compete for earning class
        points.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it is not Nagumo's initiative, but rather the consensus of the class to let them do what
        they want to do. It was carried on in a way that made everyone think that winning was
        secondary.
    </p>
    <p>Just by looking at the props being brought in from a distance, it can be seen that a fair amount
        of money has been invested. As if to show this, the 3-year class A finally announced its own
        pre-opening yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>They started by inviting students who were interested in taking part to really experience the
        maze haunted house so they could get their feedback. I couldn't help but feel that the students
        were determined to present a high quality show to the guests on the day of the event.
    </p>
    <p>I've never experienced a cultural festival before, so I would like to experience firsthand what the
        other classes have to offer, no matter how it is organized.
    </p>
    <p>After school, I went to visit the gymnasium to attend the pre-opening.
    </p>
    <p>There weren't many first and second graders present in the gymnasium even on the first day,
    </p>
    <p>probably because the pre-opening was divided into several days.
    </p>
    <p>Because of the lighting being dim, Unlike usual, the gymnasium has a different kind of frightful
        atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>Shortly after lining up at the end of the line, I heard a familiar voice.
    </p>
    <p>"It's amazing, Student Council President, that you would be so open about it. You're so proud to
        show it to the public."
    </p>
    <p>"It's not easy to hide something on such a large scale, It was a wise decision to release the
        information at an early stage if it was to be used for practice as well."
    </p>
    <p>Looking back briefly, I saw Ichinose and Kanzaki approaching.
    </p>
    <p>Apparently, like me, they had come to check on the situation as well as to scout the area.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh…"
    </p>
    <p>Naturally, both of them became aware of my presence when they attempted to join the line.
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose responded quickly and carefully, lowering her head slightly and averting her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki silently glanced at Ichinose and I before joining the Line.
    </p>
    <p>The line did not move as fast as it should have, as an awkward silence began to flow. Perhaps
        because it was the first day, the third-year students did not seem to be able to proceed
        smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>"... Ah, yeah That's it. I just remembered something urgent. Kanzaki-kun, I'm sorry, but can I
        leave this to you ...?"
    </p>
    <p>It was clearly random, but Kanzaki nodded his head in agreement without question.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh right, See you later."
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose, who could not be rude at any time, formally said a few words to me as well and left the
        line. Only Kanzaki and I were left behind.
    </p>
    <p>Even a student with no prior knowledge of the situation is likely to somewhat understand the
        reason. If it's Kanzaki, then the situation would be clear as day.
    </p>
    <p>"How are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>I asked him about that, but soon Kanzaki's face turned serious.
    </p>
    <p>"You think I'm fine?"
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose's class, which has been slowly losing class points, cannot be in any good shape.
    </p>
    <p>A half-provocation would have been what it sounded like.

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        By the time I finished reading the explanation, Kanzaki had left the line and turned his back to
        me.
    </p>
    <p>Probably waiting for Ichinose to come back.
    </p>
    <p>I made this deduction based on the assumption that she would be back by the time I left the
        gymnasium.
    </p>
    <p>After signing my consent to the explanation, leaving Kanzaki alone, I stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>The walls in the haunted house are naturally narrow and the visibility is quite poor.
    </p>
    <p>The lamp, which appears to have been purchased at a uniform store, is wrapped in tape,
    </p>
    <p>perhaps to narrow down the light source, so it does not serve as a light as much as it should.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, I often used the Internet to research cultural festivals, but I wonder if it is possible to
        produce such high quality. The technical proficiency of the third-year students, or rather the
        third-year A class, truly astounds me.
    </p>
    <p>I began to observe more carefully, ignoring the ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>It comes as no surprise that most of the significant and eerie elements are made by human
        hands while the atmosphere is primarily generated with ornaments that have been embellished.
    </p>
    <p>The long neck of the rokurokubi is timed to the timing of the incoming guests by the student
        hiding behind it.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note - Rokurokubi (ろくろ首, 轆轤首) is a type of Japanese yōkai (Japanese Ghosts). There

        There are several tricks that are clearly still in the process of being produced, but they will be
        completed and their quality will be improved in the production.
    </p>
    <p>Although it might not be as well-liked by adults, it might be highly well-liked by their families,
    </p>
    <p>especially kids. People will typically avoid something if the price is too high, but if it's something
        their kids want, they'll probably increase their spending restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>This will play a significant role in the future clarification of the maid café policies.
    </p>
    <p>I reached the halfway point of the exhibit.
    </p>
    <p>As I was about to follow the sign that said "turn left," a shadow in my field of vision moved.
    </p>
    <p>It seems they are trying to scare me again with a new trick.
    </p>
    <p>"Wah, ah, oh~ oh!"
    </p>
    <p>I was the one who was supposed to be screaming but the ghost who jumped out, stumbled over
        a step right in front of me and fell with a scream.
    </p>
    <p>It was Asahina Nazuna from 3rd year A class.
    </p>
    <p>I didn't help her because I thought it might be staged, but when I saw her fainting in pain, I was
        convinced it was an unexpected accident.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image3.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        It's no wonder that this happened in this darkness…
        "Ow, ow!"
    </p>
    <p>"Are you okay?"
    </p>
    <p>In a sense, it's a scary scenario reaching out to a ghost that shouldn't be alive.
    </p>
    <p>"Ah, thank you… ouch, very much!"
    </p>
    <p>She apparently has difficulty standing on her own and sits down on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>Since I couldn't just leave it like this, I decided to help.
    </p>
    <p>"Which way is the exit?"
    </p>
    <p>"What? the exit...? Maybe it's this way?"
    </p>
    <p>"Wouldn't it be better to turn back?"
    </p>
    <p>Since I remember the way to the entrance, I should be able to return quickly with some help.
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry, just trust your Senpai…"
    </p>
    <p>She screams in pain. It's as a result of her fruitless attempts to strike a confident, self-assured
        pose.
    </p>
    <p>The instructions sounded very unreliable, but it would be better to follow them here.
    </p>
    <p>It should be faster than me groping my way out from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>I got lost several times, and then reached the exit, with my senpai who was afraid of the reaction
        of her classmates.
    </p>
    <p>I had intended to leave immediately, leaving Asahina in charge, but due to the pre-opening,
    </p>
    <p>there did not seem to be any students available.
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry about me. Thank you, Ayanokoji-kun. I'm sure I'll be fine after a little rest."
    </p>
    <p>I crouch down to check Asahina's ankle.
    </p>
    <p>"Wait, hey?"
    </p>
    <p>"Please Let me see."
    </p>
    <p>"Uh, alright…"
    </p>
    <p>It is beginning to swell at an early stage that is to say it was twisted a bit.
    </p>
    <p>If she does not receive proper treatment, it could have repercussions later on in the future.
    </p>
    <p>"I think you should go to the infirmary. Wouldn't it be hard to be out of action at the festival?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. Yeah, maybe I should."
    </p>
    <p>When she tried to get up and walk alone and realized that she could not do so due to pain, she
        switched to a plan of standing on only her left leg, which wasn't hurt, and moving forward on one
        leg.
    </p>
    <p>But with each small jump, a vibration is felt in the right leg, causing painful expressions.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll lend you a hand after all."
    </p>
    <p>"Uh… but..."
    </p>
    <p>She may be reluctant to seek my assistance for reasons, though I'm sure that feeling of
        embarrassment is not the only one.
    </p>
    <p>"President Nagumo, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"... How'd you know?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, Somehow ."
    </p>
    <p>"If he saw Ayanokoji-kun getting involved with an A-class student, it probably wouldn't look
        good. I can't have you getting in trouble because of me, can I?"
    </p>
    <p>She seems to be more concerned about me than her own injuries.
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry. I'm sure that Nagumo, the student council president, doesn't take me seriously
        anymore."
    </p>
    <p>"Oh Really?"
    </p>
    <p>"I think he might have realized he was overestimating me.."
    </p>
    <p>I decided to help Asahina and take her to the infirmary.
    </p>
    <p>"Thank you." | "Arigato, ne"
    </p>
    <p>The somewhat conspicuous attire is troubling, but I suppose it can't be helped.
    </p>
    <p>I lent a shoulder and walked up to the infirmary, receiving curious looks from some people.
    </p>
    <p>The doctor immediately sat her down on the bed to administer the treatment.
    </p>
    <p>Asahina was told to wait a little more before getting ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>As I was about to turn away to leave, I was called by a voice.
    </p>
    <p>"By the way, that was a disaster for Ayanokoji-kun's class."
    </p>
    <p>Missing the timing to leave the infirmary, I stood there and started talking.
    </p>
    <p>"You mean the information leak? About the opening of a maid cafe?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah."
    </p>
    <p>A trick performed this very morning by Ryuen.
    </p>
    <p>The maid cafe that we were secretly working on became known throughout the whole school.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, there are basically more disadvantages of everyone knowing what your class is
        going to do.
    </p>
    <p>"Class C. Ryuen's class has also decided to compete in the maid cafe."
    </p>
    <p>Simply because we will have competing stores, we will be competing for customers with the
        same goal.
    </p>
    <p>"We can only hope that, with the two classes fighting over similar concepts, no other class will
        follow suit."
    </p>
    <p>"Even if you do the same thing in 3 classes and 4 classes, it will only make the customer's
        interaction and competition worse."
    </p>
    <p>Chasing after, will only increase the risk.
    </p>
    <p>It's not impossible for them to open a maid cafe as a side business, but it won't be easy to beat
        those of us who are devoting a lot of resources to it.
    </p>
    <p>Soon after, the doctor brought bandages and other treatment tools. Eventually, I decided to
        watch the treatment process.
    </p>
    <p>The treatment was soon over, and she is told that she will be able to walk without any problems
        if she rested for a few days. Once it was clear that there would be no problems with the festival,
    </p>
    <p>Asahina let out both the pain she had been enduring and the relief she felt at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, thank God. I didn't want to bother the class with this."
    </p>
    <p>"The class advantage won't change, so why bother?"
    </p>
    <p>If they get last place at the festival, they won't lose any class points.
    </p>
    <p>"It doesn't work that way, There is nothing better than having a lot of class points. Even though
        Miyabi's letting it go this time, there are quite a few students who are against it."
    </p>
    <p>With her eyes lowered, Asahina continues.
    </p>
    <p>"For students who haven't decided to win, they still need as many class points as possible, don't
        they? Even at the festival, if you win first place, that's more private points you get by the time
        you graduate."
    </p>
    <p>Given the rules of the third grade, which is dominated by Nagumo, it is natural to want as many
        as possible to graduate from class A.
    </p>
    <p>Even for Class A, they cannot just abandon Class B and the rest.
    </p>
    <p>"For the time being, it seems that Miyabi is saying that he will pick one person from the class
        that will take first place by competing, other than Class A."
    </p>
    <p>So then the complaints from the three remaining classes would not be as strong.
    </p>
    <p>But even so, it cannot be completely suppressed without showing a willingness to get as many
        class points as possible.
    </p>
    <p>The pressure on the third year Class A, who abandoned winning, will only increase.
    </p>
    <p>"I was just thinking about what you said earlier. Ayanokoji-kun, you said you noticed Miyabi was
        overestimating you and stopped, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes."
    </p>
    <p>"At first I thought, well, that's maybe true, But maybe I was wrong after all."
    </p>
    <p>"Why?"
    </p>
    <p>"There wasn't a clear winner or loser with Miyabi and you, was there?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. That's true."
    </p>
    <p>I and Nagumo have never once settled in a head-to-head match.
    </p>
    <p>"If so, I still don't think it's over."
    </p>
    <p>"I have no intention of fighting. I don't think I'm up to it by any stretch of the imagination."
    </p>
    <p>It is a waste of time just to deal with this.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't think it matters. In fact, it might go worse than it is now. It's not about Ayanokoji-kun
        anymore, it could be something he does to someone close to you."
    </p>
    <p>There are some things that only Asahina, who has been watching Nagumo by his side for the
        past three years, can see.
    </p>
    <p>"Like with former Student Council President Horikita, Nagumo likes to compete."
    </p>
    <p>"Uh, yeah. I'm pretty sure that's true."
    </p>
    <p>"Has Nagumo ever been clearly beaten by someone? Has he ever stumbled a little?"
    </p>
    <p>It is not hard to guess from looking at Nagumo's attitude so far.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't think Miyabi ever stumbled over one. At least not that I know of."
    </p>
    <p>There is a lot of confidence in Nagumo's victory from his classmates.
    </p>
    <p>"There is no doubt that Student Council President Nagumo is an excellent person. If he were
        falsely competent, it would be impossible for him to misrepresent OAA or become student
        council president."
    </p>
    <p>There are numerous issues that cannot be managed just through political tactics.
    </p>
    <p>"He likes to be number one. That's why he fought to be number one in this school. In the end,
    </p>
    <p>he even became the student body president, so he is a man of his word."
    </p>
    <p>"But if you ask me if Nagumo is the strongest and number 1, I will immediately deny it."
    </p>
    <p>"Why is that...? He has never lost to anyone in particular."
    </p>
    <p>"I think it's because he never had good opponents."
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo is not weak.
    </p>
    <p>However, there is no doubt that Nagumo's opponents were weak.
    </p>
    <p>"I think his greatest misfortune was that he had no one in his grade who was equal to or better
        than him and willing to compete with him."
    </p>
    <p>"A worthy opponent... So you mean he didn't have any good rivals?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes."
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, by competing only with lower-ranked players, Nagumo has been able to get to
        No. 1 without much effort. Of course, he may have had the second or third best from the start,
    </p>
    <p>but he soon overtook them and became the sole runner.
    </p>
    <p>After running, He looked back and saw that no one was chasing him.
    </p>
    <p>All of them gave up and walked away or stopped because they could not beat Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>There may have occasionally been individuals around who were equally gifted as he was, such
        as Kiryuin, but if they had not made an effort to catch up with and surpass Nagumo, they would
        have been nothing more than stones at the side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo's distorted mindset can be attributed to the fact that he was oblivious to the rigours and
        challenges of competition, as well as the anguish of losing right away.
    </p>
    <p>The fact that he’s planning and executing strange revenge tactics against me isn’t out of any
        sense of defeat or inferiority complex, but it is only to bring me in the open.
    </p>
    <p>He never imagined losing when he requested a one-on-one match at the sports festival.
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo couldn't have known everything about me, so it's understandable, but even if he had
        witnessed my complete might in person, he wouldn't have questioned his success.
    </p>
    <p>A person who has never actually experienced defeat. The negative effects of successive victory
        streaks.
    </p>
    <p>"I wish we could just stop fighting in this school."
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder"
    </p>
    <p>"I just hope everything stays as is and nothing bad happens…"
    </p>
    <p>That wouldn't be the case.
    </p>
    <p>This cultural event has unmistakably demonstrated Nagumo's alteration in behaviour, which was
        subtly communicated to the general public.
    </p>
    <p>The general public might assume that Nagumo's aggression and curiosity have merely been
        repressed.
    </p>
    <p>In reality, this is not true. This is merely the calm before the storm.
    </p>
    <p>After this, Nagumo will take action against me… no, against anyone other than me.
    </p>
    <p>It may not be enough to just expel one or two people.
    </p>
    <p>It can be said that this is the payback for the behaviour I have shown for Nagumo up to now.
    </p>
    <p>If you leave the bomb that has swollen up to this point, it wouldn't be unexpected if the
        development just mentioned happens.
    </p>
    <p>I recalled Horikita Manabu's words,
    </p>
    <p>"Nagumo's methods make a lot of people unhappy."
    </p>
    <p>That is half true.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, I don't deny that I played a part in that factor, but the original plan was to just mess
        with Nagumo's emotions and thought process.
    </p>
    <p>As for The other half.
    </p>
    <p>Students who wouldn’t have originally graduated in Class A due to Nagumo's methods are
        indeed getting that chance.
    </p>
    <p>Even though in small numbers, first-year and second-year students have also been given class
        transfer tickets in addition to third-year students.
    </p>
    <p>Although there are restrictions on how to use them, they are products that previously didn’t
        exist.
    </p>
    <p>If it had concerned me up until last year, I would’ve watched Nagumo's actions with more
        interest.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm becoming a little more interested in Student Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>"Did I hear you right just now?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes."
    </p>
    <p>An interest that I have never felt before, even once, rises up from deep within.
    </p>
    <p>"I knew you were unusual."
    </p>
    <p>After casting her gaze down at her bandaged leg, Asahina gave a small laugh.
    </p>
    <p>"It may have been a coincidence that we met, but maybe that's why Miyabi wants to fight."
    </p>
    <p>Looking back, the result of "coincidence" was also a major factor in my making contact with
        Asahina.
    </p>
    <p>Coincidence— huh?
    </p>
    <p>In my conversation with her, I constructed a rationale.
    </p>
    <p>The coincidence just mentioned is out of control.
    </p>
    <p>But it's not entirely out of control.
    </p>
    <p>Coincidences can change the form of the things greatly depending on one's point of view and
        perspective.
    </p>
    <p>Asahina Nazuna and her amulet, the existence of coincidence and Nagumo Miyabi.
    </p>
    <p>This is not bad as a test case.
    </p>
    <p>Just as an experiment is a series of failures followed by success
    </p>
    <h3>Part 5</h3>
    <p>
        Leaving Asahina in the infirmary, I returned to the gymnasium.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing I was curious about was Kanzaki, and to find out how Ichinose was doing, who
        was expected to have returned. If I were to stand out too much, the same thing would happen
        again, so I walked farther away from the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>The fact that Kanzaki is not visible in the line suggests that he is either inside or has already left.
    </p>
    <p>However, by the looks of things earlier, it was clear that he was waiting for Ichinose's return.
    </p>
    <p>Since there was a bit of a commotion when I took out injured Asahina, I don't think Kanzaki, who
        was waiting for Ichinose's return and for me to leave, would have missed it.
    </p>
    <p>Then it took me about 15 minutes to come back from the infirmary.
    </p>
    <p>Unless Ichinose had returned immediately after that, I wouldn't be surprised if she was still
        inside.
    </p>
    <p>While making general observations, I also decided to pay attention to the faces of the students
        coming out.
    </p>
    <p>Then a few minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki slowly emerged from the exit.
    </p>
    <p>I knew he was still in the gymnasium, but what surprised me was what happened after that.
    </p>
    <p>I thought for sure Ichinose was next to him, but Kanzaki was alone. She was not lagging behind,
    </p>
    <p>nor did he seem to be concerned about what was behind him.
    </p>
    <p>I thought he was just going to walk away, but then he turned around and saw me.
    </p>
    <p>Then, after staring at me for a few seconds, he approached me.
    </p>
    <p>"You're back after all. It seems her injuries were not too serious."
    </p>
    <p>It would have been difficult to believe that I was just standing here, if it had been a major issue.
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki probably implied it from that.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you wondering why Ichinose isn’t here?"
    </p>
    <p>"To be honest, a little."
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't call her because I was worried about the possibility of bumping into you coming back
        from the infirmary. Besides, there are still a few days left for the pre-opening."
    </p>
    <p>So, Ichinose will visit it later to observe without any rush.
    </p>
    <p>The presentation for the Ichinose class appears to have a rather predetermined course.
    </p>
    <p>You should push yourself to go on a visit if you are having trouble and refrain from asking in the
        process.
    </p>
    <p>"I want to continue where we left off earlier. Your class seems to be doing quite well."
    </p>
    <p>It was clear that he was referring to a series of events from the Uninhabited island exam to the
        unanimous special exam, and if we go back a little further, to the beginning of second year.
    </p>
    <p>"Unlike Kanzaki's class, we had dropouts over here. We also have negatives that you can't see
        with class points alone."
    </p>
    <p>"You're not the only ones with invisible risks, but you've made a significant difference in terms of
        the positives that you can see."
    </p>
    <p>Rather than envy, I would say that this is an honest opinion of Kanzaki.
    </p>
    <p>"A class like yours will eventually have to fight Sakayanagi's class."
    </p>
    <p>One thing that stuck out to me was Kanzaki's somewhat optimistic, one-step- back assessment
        of his own class.
    </p>
    <p>"Have you given up already? Moving up to Class A?"
    </p>
    <p>"... Maybe."
    </p>
    <p>Instead of a negative answer, Kanzaki replied somewhat positively.
    </p>
    <p>It isn’t difficult to guess what he was thinking. Ichinose's class isn’t a disastrous one.
    </p>
    <p>They are not likely to lose many points for tardiness, absenteeism, behaviour problems, and the
        like because they are a serious class.
    </p>
    <p>They rarely make significant blunders on special exams and hardly ever lose class points.
    </p>
    <p>But in other words, they don’t have the opportunity to make big jumps on special exams.
    </p>
    <p>"No one has yet to notice how the class is slowly sinking. It would still be endearing if they were
        just pretending not to notice, but they’re all genuinely oblivious."
    </p>
    <p>"Only you seem to be different."
    </p>
    <p>"That was until a little while ago; there's no point in rebelling alone."
    </p>
    <p>"You mean you've given up on trying to change their minds?"
    </p>
    <p>"Our class will never make it to Class A."
    </p>
    <p>Here, Kanzaki said it clearly.
    </p>
    <p>"If the possibility has been reduced to zero, the only thing left to do is to find
        another way. If we are going to sink anyway, we should give as many people as possible a
        chance to escape."
    </p>
    <p>"So you're going to move to a different class after accumulating 20 million points?"
    </p>
    <p>"Because Student Council President Nagumo Miyabi has actually implemented this and it’s
        shown to be effective. Concentrating private points on Ichinose is what we’ve been doing. If we
        execute this plan to the limit, we can move at least two or three people to Class A. In addition,
    </p>
    <p>the existence of class transfer tickets was shown for the first time at the sports festival. Of
        course, it won't be easy to acquire them, but the increase in options is a genuinely pleasing
        factor."
    </p>
    <p>"Why are you telling me all this?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know what I'm doing either."
    </p>
    <p>It was an uncharacteristic response. Kanzaki paused for a moment and began
        to search for a better answer.
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't have a place to vent. Maybe that's why."
    </p>
    <p>If there’s a problem in daily life, it’ll be shared among those close to the student, regardless of
        whether or not they’re within the same class, and a solution is found.
    </p>
    <p>However, when it comes to class problems, the only way out is to give up on achieving Class A
        and transfer to another class.
    </p>
    <p>If you say such a thing in class, it is inevitable that you will be surrounded by conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>It would be impossible to get support in Ichinose’s class for this.
    </p>
    <p>"I could only think of you as someone who understood what I was saying and didn't interrupt."
    </p>
    <p>I see. He believed I was the best outlet to express his negative emotions. Of course, that isn’t
        the only reason.
    </p>
    <p>It seems that he also holds resentment toward me, who has a strong influence on Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't care what happened between you and Ichinose or what kind of relationship you two
        have. The fact that you're having such a bad influence that she can't even do a satisfactory
        observation of the third-year Class A’s exhibit is a major issue."
    </p>
    <p>"It’s a little harsh when you put it that way."
    </p>
    <p>"You'll have to forgive me. I’m sure you understand how frustrating it is."
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki then raised his hand and told me he’s leaving.
    </p>
    <p>The back of the class strategist, who had given up on winning, appeared smaller than usual.
    </p>
    <p>It's a little harsh to call him back here, but I can't just let Kanzaki leave as he is now.
    </p>
    <p>"Can we talk sometime soon? I would like to talk a little about the future."
    </p>
    <p>"Why not now? I have time to talk about the future."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but right now I need to do some research on the third-year's stalls."
    </p>
    <p>Besides, starting a discussion now is not going to make any progress.
    </p>
    <p>We need another piece that can enter the conversation in order to talk about the future.
    </p>
    <p>"That's fine if that's how things are. Call me anytime."
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 6</h3>
    <p>
        It was near the weekend, Friday.
    </p>
    <p>I had come to a place I don't usually visit to meet a student.
    </p>
    <p>When I opened the door of the student council room after knocking, Nagumo showed a
        surprised face for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>Other than Nagumo, there were no students or teachers in sight, and as Asahina had informed
        me, he seemed to be alone today.
    </p>
    <p>Even to him, it would have been unexpected for me to come.
    </p>
    <p>The cell phone is clutched in his left hand, as if he had been looking at it just a moment ago.
    </p>
    <p>I must have been an unwelcome visitor, but he didn't turn me right away, instead encouraged
        me to enter.
    </p>
    <p>"Excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>The door leading into the room closed with a slam, and a moment of silence passed between
        the two of us.
    </p>
    <p>"Nazuna asked me to wait for some time here, so I waited but I didn't think that it was you who
        had asked. So, are you here for the student council?"
    </p>
    <p>"I have no business with the student council. I'm here to talk to President Nagumo personally."
    </p>
    <p>As I said that, he sat back deeper in his chair and put the cell phone in his hand on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>"If that's the case, I have to give you credit for showing up in front of me. Right? Ayanokoji."
    </p>
    <p>"I assume you are referring to the sports festival, but isn't being sick a legitimate and recognized
        reason for absence?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't make me laugh. Some of the guys saw you all fine at the Keyaki Mall the day after the
        sports festival ended.
    </p>
    <p>"It only took a day to get better."
    </p>
    <p>"That's a blatant lie."
    </p>
    <p>"It might be true."
    </p>
    <p>It was a bit of a play on words, but Nagumo seemed to realize that further pursuit was pointless.
    </p>
    <p>"Truth or lie, I don’t really care anymore. Anyway, let me hear your reason for coming here."
    </p>
    <p>His troublesome attitude must’ve come from the bottom of his heart. He doesn't even bother to
        disguise the fact that he wants to wrap up the conversation right away.
    </p>
    <p>A transparent demeanour, meanwhile, also suggests that he may be concealing his genuine
        emotions.
    </p>
    <p>"May I sit down? I think it's going to be a bit long."
    </p>
    <p>"You said you didn't have any business with the student council. So it's okay for me to turn you
        down, right?
    </p>
    <p>As student council president, Nagumo was prepared to listen even to those he did not like. But if
        it wasn't related to the student council, he did not want to listen any longer.
    </p>
    <p>Well, it's not surprising.
    </p>
    <p>"If you won't listen to me, I'll leave."
    </p>
    <p>If Nagumo, as an individual, was too lazy to even converse with me, I had no choice.
    </p>
    <p>However, I don't believe that’s the case. If his interest in me completely vanished, that would be
        a different story, but deep down, I believe the spark is still there.
    </p>
    <p>In other words, he’ll never refuse. It’s precisely because I’m certain of this that I also took time
        out of my precious day to visit this place.
    </p>
    <p>After a few moments of silence, Nagumo instructed me to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>I moved my chair and sat down so that we could face each other head-on.
    </p>
    <p>"Too bad I don't have anything for a drink."
    </p>
    <p>"No problem."
    </p>
    <p>You can tell by looking that it is not the atmosphere and attitude of apology by looking at this
        situation.
    </p>
    <p>For him, it is probably just a feeling of, 'What are you doing here after all this time?'
    </p>
    <p>"I had no idea that the 3rd year Class A would do a pre-opening. It's normal to think of it as a
        disadvantage to expose the class’s exhibit to the public."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm also getting stories up here that some stupid class had their event exposed."
    </p>
    <p>"It's a painful story, isn't it? By the way Come to think of it, I also heard that Ryuen even visited
        Student Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>"He was pressing me to bet tens of millions of points with him."
    </p>
    <p>"I heard you refused."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, well, the game with you is over and so is my school life. As a result, the school festival
        has turned into something unimportant. Then, I don't need to bother to send instructions around.
    </p>
    <p>I'm just letting them do whatever they want for memories until graduation."
    </p>
    <p>He therefore took a position whereby all the details about his class's booth are available while
        he takes part in a simple cultural festival like any other student at any other school.
    </p>
    <p>The third-year Class A continues to be on the top whether they come in first or twelve.
    </p>
    <p>The complaints of people in Class B and lower are presumably unimportant to Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>"But tens of millions? There won’t be enough, even if he’ll gather it together from his class."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen’s class, which has high income but heavily spends, doesn’t have lined pockets.
    </p>
    <p>"That guy told me he would give me the right to expel any student I wanted, even himself."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen was going to use the students themselves as collateral for the funds he couldn't provide.
    </p>
    <p>"Last year I would’ve taken him up on that offer. I’d be dealing with a separate year, but it
        would’ve been interesting if we were playing for expulsion."
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo remarked he already lost his enthusiasm and interest in the school.
    </p>
    <p>"If you want to compete, go ahead. You are free to do whatever you want."
    </p>
    <p>"I understand your personal view, but aren't there many students who don't agree with it?"
    </p>
    <p>"No one can complain to me, ’cause if they do, their Class A status will no longer be
        guaranteed. When the festival gets closer, I, or rather the student council, will make a
        not-so-bad proposal. A little help for a class that’s struggling to win."
    </p>
    <p>"I see. You've thought about it a lot,haven't you?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I'm the student council president, after all."
    </p>
    <p>After giving a model answer, Nagumo exhaled a sigh and urged,
    </p>
    <p>"Come on, tell me what you came here for."
    </p>
    <p>"All I want is to have a conversation with the student council president. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't exactly believe that."
    </p>
    <p>"You don't believe me? I'm actually a little surprised with my own actions. Until now, I've been
        trying to keep my distance from Student Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>"I know that very well."
    </p>
    <p>However, he probably didn't understand the root of why.
    </p>
    <p>"Do you know why?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know. I’m sure it’s not because you’re scared of my ability."
    </p>
    <p>"Unlike the previous student council president, Horikita Manabu, Student Council President
        Nagumo attracts the eyes of those around him. This is partly because he is a bit too bright for a
        shady person like me to face."
    </p>
    <p>"Sure. But that’s just a front, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo lightly dismissed the pretense of respect and urged me to reveal my true intentions.
    </p>
    <p>"I wasn't interested."
    </p>
    <p>It's a bit of a stretch, but that’s what I said. I'm going to speak my mind.
    </p>
    <p>While recognizing a certain level of ability, it’s all I could say.
    </p>
    <p>That's why I didn't think I needed to get involved in whatever Nagumo was doing.
    </p>
    <p>"If someone else said what I just heard from your mouth, I might’ve gotten angry."
    </p>
    <p>"I didn’t realize I was being rude."
    </p>
    <p>"No, you don't need to apologize. It's your choice to feel that way. I'm the one who got you to tell
        me how you really feel."
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo said that, but he quickly added,
    </p>
    <p>"But still, if it hadn't been you who said that, I'd have changed their mind in a heartbeat."
    </p>
    <p>He wouldn't hesitate to entrap the speaker so that the speaker would be interested even if he
        didn't like it.
    </p>
    <p>With Nagumo's power and abilities, that is not a difficult task.
    </p>
    <p>"Soon your term as student council president will be over, and Student Council President
        Nagumo will remain in Class A and graduate. I thought that would be fine. Until just the other
        day."
    </p>
    <p>"You think otherwise now?"
    </p>
    <p>"I had a change of heart. I felt that I could face you directly, and that's why I'm here."
    </p>
    <p>There is no need for restraints, fake flattery, or false emotions.
    </p>
    <p>It's better for the future if I express my thoughts. I informed Nagumo, who was waiting for me to
        proceed, of the primary reason I had come to this place today.
    </p>
    <p>"I have a proposal for President Nagumo. Can I make a challenge to the student council
        president this time?"
    </p>
    <p>Making such a statement probably never crossed Nagumo’s mind.
    </p>
    <p>"I doubt that, this isn’t like you."
    </p>
    <p>A change of heart, such an answer was not enough to convince Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know when exactly this change of heart came, but it's too late. You ran away from the
        last chance I gave you at the sports festival. If I may borrow words from your true feelings, you
        weren't interested. Am I right?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. I know it's a convenient story."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, that's right. After having given up so many chances to compete repeatedly, there is no way
        I could honestly say yes when you're asking me for a match now, mentioning a change of heart.
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo didn’t change his position and continued to show directness.
    </p>
    <p>"And, get this, it’s the same as what you said earlier about the sports festival. You said you were
        sick the whole time. I've decided that's an obvious lie. Besides, don't tell me you've forgotten
        about what happened on the island."
    </p>
    <p>"Then, would you like to replicate what happened on the island? This time, in the opposite
        position?"
    </p>
    <p>If Nagumo could punch me in the gut here, It could be like an apology.
    </p>
    <p>However, he wouldn't be the one who would be convinced by such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>"That's not funny, Ayanokoji. It wouldn’t ever be the same knockout. There’s a huge difference in
        value between you and me."
    </p>
    <p>Naturally, there was no room for a discussion of the proposal. It was obvious that there was at
        least that much of a difference between Ayanokoji Kiyotaka and Nagumo Miyabi, at least in this
        school.
    </p>
    <p>One was an ordinary student in the 2nd year Class B, while the other was the leader of the 3rd
        year Class A and the student council president.
    </p>
    <p>The difference between what we’re capable of was so great that even a comparison was
        unacceptable.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not going to delay it now, but I'm allowed to challenge you to a fight, but you're not allowed
        to challenge me to a fight. Do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>"I understand, but that's exactly delaying it. I'm right here in front of you and I'm willing to fight
        President Nagumo. Would you agree with that?
    </p>
    <p>I intentionally cut my fingertips and dripped blood on the bloodthirsty wolf.
    </p>
    <p>But the wolf in front of me didn’t bite easily.
    </p>
    <p>The wolf was much more careful than in the past, when he had been acting provocatively but
        without any defence. He already would have had his fangs at my fingertips if he had previously
        viewed me as his enemy. He might not have realised it, but that was evidence that he saw me
        as a threat.
    </p>
    <p>"You really are strange. You don't show any sign of hesitation when dealing with me. No, it's not
        only against me, but also against Horikita-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo looked out the window as if remembering the days of Horikita Manabu.
    </p>
    <p>His original desire was to fight the elder Horikita, not me. That goal was unattainable, but it was
        also true that there were no other alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>"—If I were to play with you, what would you do? It's almost the third semester of the school
        year, and we already passed the second semester’s halfway point. As you probably know by
        now, I gave all the power to my classmates to compete for sales at the school festival. I can't
        ask them to give it back now. On the other hand, even if I wait for the next special exam, there’s
        no guarantee that there will be a competition between all the grades."
    </p>
    <p>We could leave it to luck and wait, hoping that there would still be a battle between all grades.
    </p>
    <p>Not that such a thing couldn't be done, but it wouldn't be very realistic.
    </p>
    <p>"Above all, you’re well aware of the difficulty of competing in earnest between different grades,
    </p>
    <p>as you and the former student council president know, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo Miyabi was eager to compete against Horikita Manabu at the sports festival from the
        previous year, training camps, etc.
    </p>
    <p>He forced himself to do it, trying to turn it black and white, no matter what form it took or how
        little the match.
    </p>
    <p>Despite the circumstances, Manabu dodged Nagumo's provocations and didn’t involve anyone
        in the match given the whole situation .
    </p>
    <p>"More than anyone else. How hard do you have to work to adjust? Because of you, not just this
        year, last year too, the match with Horikita-senpai didn't happen."
    </p>
    <p>In that sense, too, Nagumo was not pleased with me.
    </p>
    <p>"Listen to what I'm about to tell you and think about whether a confrontation can be achieved."
    </p>
    <p>As I said this, Nagumo sat back deeper in his chair, correcting his posture a bit.
    </p>
    <p>We had various patterns to use to prepare for the special exams the school administered, even
        if many of them were unknown. Because no matter what form the confrontation was introduced,
    </p>
    <p>there was always a method to execute. Nagumo didn't say anything after I finished telling him
        everything and he appeared to be thinking.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know if we can achieve a 100% perfect match, but I think this can become a reality."
    </p>
    <p>"I agree, but do you really think you're going to be able to execute your plan?"
    </p>
    <p>"I am sure that Student Council President Nagumo can already see the situation. You have been
        observing on a daily basis, haven't you? If that's the case, there's no way you don't know the
        details.
    </p>
    <p>"I see. I was going to shake you up at the time, but instead of getting to that point, you decided
        to use it against me."
    </p>
    <p>"Will you accept my proposal or not?"
    </p>
    <p>We spoke for quite a long time, even for me. But this conversational work is necessary in
        negotiations with Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>"I'd be happy to accept your proposal, but..."
    </p>
    <p>The reply was positive, but the words had other meanings.
    </p>
    <p>"But what’s your real purpose?"
    </p>
    <p>"Can’t you believe it? I just want to compete with President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't believe it for a second."
    </p>
    <p>As if convinced, he replied without hesitance. I was somewhat pleased, but decided to wait for
        Nagumo's next words.
    </p>
    <p>"Alright, tell me the main issue. I'll think about whether or not I'll accept the proposal after that."
    </p>
    <p>He let me cut to the other main topic without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>"I have a favor to ask of the Student Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>I gave an explanation based on the content of the request and its specific development.
    </p>
    <p>After hearing this, Nagumo sat back deeply in the chair of the student council president, where
        he had been sitting for almost an year.
    </p>
    <p>"I understand what you’re telling me. But that's not a proposal based on your desire to compete
        with me. You brought up the idea of a match because you had no choice but to control what you
        wanted to happen. Am I right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Half right, half wrong. It's also true that I myself changed my view of the Student Council
        President, and that's why I want to compete. However, I also feel that half of it is a hassle."
    </p>
    <p>"You're an honest guy."
    </p>
    <p>"That's why I want you to accept my proposal."
    </p>
    <p>"He's a joke. You requested a match, and now you've got the audacity to say that."
    </p>
    <p>"I won't deny that."
    </p>
    <p>"Do you think I'm going to play along with you and give you what you want?"
    </p>
    <p>"If you refuse, that's the end of it. I will never fight the Student Council President again. Even if
        you use a classmate or someone in the same grade as me. Not even if you take someone
        hostage, I will thoroughly ignore them, and you."
    </p>
    <p>"I doubt it. If it's a random guy, you’d probably leave him for dead, but if it's Karuizawa Kei?"
    </p>
    <p>Here Nagumo tried to sway me by mentioning Kei.
    </p>
    <p>"It doesn’t matter who it is."
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo's smile disappeared as I answered immediately without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>"It doesn't sound like you’re bluffing. It seems like… you really mean it."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not an omniscient and omnipotent god. I can't protect everyone 24/7, 365 days a year,
    </p>
    <p>whether it's Kei or my classmates. If the student council president, who has the most power in
        this school and the control of a large student body, wanted to do so, he could have someone
        expelled from school without my supervision."
    </p>
    <p>Of course, there was a risk of paying a significant price for the trouble, but I didn’t care.
    </p>
    <p>"Whoever you expel, I won't make a move again."
    </p>
    <p>This was not a tactic.
    </p>
    <p>Because it was pure sincerity, Nagumo's smile naturally disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>"Means If I want to fight you, I have no choice but to accept your current proposal."
    </p>
    <p>"Of course, you can ignore it and graduate without hesitation."
    </p>
    <p>"But won't you be in trouble if I don't help you?"
    </p>
    <p>"I've already made other plans."
    </p>
    <p>Yes, there was no longer any need to go through the hassle of telling Nagumo my narrative.
    </p>
    <p>But I mentioned half the reason earlier.
    </p>
    <p>I wanted to have this conversation because I wanted to fight him. His next remark would decide
        everything.
    </p>
    <p>The decision on whether or not the match between us will take place must be made at this
        point.
    </p>
    <p>"Okay, I'll take your word for it, Ayanokoji. My graduation from Class A is decided anyway. It's
        not a bad idea to end up playing with you."
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo couldn't even conceive about losing; he didn't believe it for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>This was the overwhelming confidence of a man who was always proud of winning.
    </p>
    <p>"Thank you very much."
    </p>
    <p>"But are you sure you want to do this? If I do what you suggest, then... no matter how it turns
        out, people will be hurt."
    </p>
    <p>"Of course. Either way, the Student Council President Nagumo would’ve been involved."
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo reacted strongly to those words.
    </p>
    <p>"...You..."
    </p>
    <p>As I was about to leave, Nagumo stood up and approached me.
    </p>
    <p>"You knew?"
    </p>
    <p>"I have observed Student Council President Nagumo from a distance. I had an idea of what you
        would do after this."
    </p>
    <p>Even though he already declared he had no intention of fighting, this man always had his sights
        set on me. It was expected that he’d take action at the right time, before it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>"So you're saying that this is no exception, not only about Karuizawa, but also about Honami."
    </p>
    <p>"Like I said, it's the same no matter who it is. Whether it's Kei’s expulsion, toying with Ichinose,
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, or anyone else. It would be wise not to think you can sway me with that."
    </p>
    <p>Snickering, Nagumo immediately switches to a serious expression.
    </p>
    <p>"I take back my comment about playing around. You are the only one that Horikita-senpai
        recognized. I've been able to make sure of that."
    </p>
    <p>"That's good to hear. Well then, I'll leave you here."
    </p>
    <p>"Oi."
    </p>
    <p>"Something still left?"
    </p>
    <p>"I admit that you have a thorough poker face. I also understand that you negotiated hard to get
        me to agree. So let me ask you once more what you really think. If I was serious about expelling
        Karuizawa, would you have stood by and watched?"
    </p>
    <p>"Kei, no, I don't think it's desirable to have an expulsion among classmates, no matter who they
        are. I was going to resist as much as possible."
    </p>
    <p>"That's not the answer. The answer you're giving is about the disadvantage of expulsion of
        classmates. What I'm saying is that I didn't feel any anxiety from you about the expulsion of
        Karuizawa, who is very special to you."
    </p>
    <p>I looked back. Normally, the solution here is obvious. I would just say something along the lines
        of,
    </p>
    <p>"I'm just bluffing so you don't know what I am thinking."
    </p>
    <p>However, I felt that was not the best answer for Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>"If it disappears, it's gone, and that's all there is to it. It is neither more nor less than that. If
        anything, it makes the cleanup easier, and that's a big help."
    </p>
    <p>"You have a few screws loose, Ayanokoji."
    </p>
    <p>This was the first time I saw Nagumo upset, or rather, muttering his opinion on something he
        didn’t quite understand.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll be in touch later."
    </p>
    <p>I quietly closed the door and left the student council room.
    </p>
    <p>Nagumo described me as having loose screws, but that's not true.
    </p>
    <p>In my opinion, the person who makes the wrong decision based on temporary feelings is the
        one with loose screws.
    </p>
    <p>It is the same whether the other person is a stranger, a lover, or a family member.
    </p>
    <p>When the time comes to fail and drop out, that's it.
    </p>
    <p>The first priority should be to protect yourself.
    </p>
    <p>That is the only consistent "solution."
    </p>
