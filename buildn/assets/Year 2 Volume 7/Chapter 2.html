    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h2>The Rebellion’s Smoke Signal
    </h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
        November the 8th, Monday.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen and the others surprised us at the concept cafe competition, and we had to deal with all
        kinds of problems, but, for these comrades who have determined what it is that they must do, it
        was not over yet.
    </p>
    <p>As a reply to the bet that Ryuuen came up with, Horikita obtained the agreement of her class
        and presented a one-on-one head on class battle for 1 million private points.
    </p>
    <p>The agreement was that the class that had even one point more than their opponent in the
        Cultural Festival sales would take these points from the opponent.
    </p>
    <p>No making a fuss, just a direct face to face battle.
    </p>
    <p>Her class-mates were waiting for exactly such forward-facing momentum, so the table was set.
    </p>
    <p>When Chabashira-sensei left the class-room and break time came, I took out my phone.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I noticed that my message had a reply, so I started reading.
    </p>
    <p>"It will take time. I’m headed for the planned spot."
    </p>
    <p>It seems that my invitation wasn’t useless.
    </p>
    <p>I did well to plan things ahead for the other day, and after this.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, Kiyotaka. Let’s go together."
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, I have some plans today."
    </p>
    <p>"What, really? Okay… Then, Maya-chan, let’s go together!!"
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to my quick reply, she turned around to Satou who was still in class.
    </p>
    <p>"I’m a second thought to Ayanokoji!?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I wouldn’t exactly say that, but… You know?"
    </p>
    <p>Even as she was quipping, Satou did not have an unpleasant expression, and actually accepted
        Kei’s invitation.
    </p>
    <p>They invited a few other girls too and joyfully left the class-room.
    </p>
    <p>A bit ahead of there, was the figure of Shinohara who was hostile to them until a while ago.
    </p>
    <p>Kei, who had closed the distance between her and Satou, once again looked like she had
        completely turned around and grown.
    </p>
    <p>Anyhow, for me, it’s a good thing that these two are talking.
    </p>
    <p>In order to meet Kanzaki after inviting him, I headed for the special building.
    </p>
    <p>This time, I could not use call or text, and it couldn’t be in front of the public.
    </p>
    <p>On the way, I saw Mashima-Sensei who is the head of Year Two A-Class, and a few others
        talking in the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>Though I was lured to this rare sight, I did not stop moving or such.
    </p>
    <p>"Chabashira-sensei has changed recently, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>While I was passing by, I heard such a conversation taking place between teachers.
    </p>
    <p>"Should I say she’s become more round, or… she’s laughing a lot more too, so."
    </p>
    <p>"Mashima-sensei, you were friends with Chabashira-sensei when you both were students,
    </p>
    <p>right?"
    </p>
    <p>It seemed like the conversation was about Chabashira-sensei.
    </p>
    <p>I think that it’s best if they gossip in the staff room instead, but perhaps it wouldn’t be right if
        they’re talking about a specific teacher or a teacher from another gender.
    </p>
    <p>Chabashira’s transformation, which the teachers were talking about, was, needless to say,
    </p>
    <p>caused by the Unanimous Special Exam.
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei noticed my existence and interrupted the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>There’s no mistaking it, he seemed like he was acting improperly not just as a homeroom
        teacher, but as a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>He must have judged that it wasn’t the best idea to let a student overhear such careless words
        coming out of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji, do you have something to do in the special building?"
    </p>
    <p>There are very few students who meaninglessly pass through these corridors after classes, so I
        could say this was a natural amount of suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>"I have a meeting. I need to talk about something that I don’t want to be overheard so
        carelessly."
    </p>
    <p>After I answered so, for some reason, everyone except Mashima-sensei looked very angry and
        walked off.
    </p>
    <p>I was able to get going right away too, but I still have some time until the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>"Mashima-sensei, I’m glad I ran into you. I have something I’d like to ask, if it’s okay."
    </p>
    <p>I bet that there is a reason Mashima-sensei stayed while the others left.
    </p>
    <p>"Me? What do you want to ask?"
    </p>
    <p>"About some unspecified rules at the Cultural Festival."
    </p>
    <p>He looked a bit suspicious for a moment, but Mashima-sensei faced me head-on as a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>There are special rules in this high school that aren’t at any other ones.
    </p>
    <p>It’s obvious that each student has their own point of view.
    </p>
    <p>However, naturally, this makes everyone very curious.
    </p>
    <p>"I don’t know what you want to ask, but first you should try asking your homeroom teacher,
    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei, right?"
    </p>
    <p>He isn’t wrong, but I ignored this and kept going.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, normally I should have asked my homeroom teacher about the rules.
    </p>
    <p>"Now and then, it’s actually better that Chabashira-sensei isn’t around."
    </p>
    <p>"Teachers shouldn’t have any biases facing students. However, if it’s other classes of the same
        grade, problems can occur. You understand that, right?"
    </p>
    <p>He reminds me that it may be too late after asking.
    </p>
    <p>"I know that you are not a person who would disappoint people’s expectations."
    </p>
    <p>He does not reward people’s trust, but he lets them do whatever they want if they trust him.
    </p>
    <p>"So, about that thing, I wanted to ask about the unclear rules."
    </p>
    <p>After getting permission, I started asking him about this special case.
    </p>
    <p>After hearing this, he was not surprised at all, but that may only be natural.
    </p>
    <p>The school also has secret rules that are not public in order to meet the various wishes of the
        students.
    </p>
    <p>Which is exactly why it isn’t strange for students to think like me.
    </p>
    <p>"It’s exactly as you think. It is not impossible to use them if we need to."
    </p>
    <p>"So that’s how it is, after all."
    </p>
    <p>This is not sudden at all.
    </p>
    <p>With the situation that the class was put in, it is not impossible to use them if needed.
    </p>
    <p>"But, it wouldn’t be sure to say that it would be effective. I think you know, but, if that happened
        between students, it would be a big problem. Well, you should have a meeting between
        yourselves to avoid that. Do you understand my meaning?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. If the rules are not specified, it would be possible to act independently."
    </p>
    <p>"That’s right. There are risks, of course, so why are you considering such a choice?"
    </p>
    <p>"I think it’s only natural to prepare for unexpected situations."
    </p>
    <p>After I replied so, Mashima-sensei looked down in thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>"So you’re not saying you’d necessarily use it, huh? I see, there really is no problem with just
        understanding things."
    </p>
    <p>"I’m glad to have gotten a confirmation. Thank you very much."
    </p>
    <p>"It’s nothing."
    </p>
    <p>With this, the things I had to confirm until the Cultural Festival are now one fewer, in an
        unexpected way.
    </p>
    <p>After our conversation, as I was about to leave, Mashima-sensei called out to me and I stopped.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji, I think that you heard a bit of our conversation about Chabashira-sensei, but… What
        happened at the Unanimous Special Test?"
    </p>
    <p>"Haven’t you heard about it from Chabashira-sensei?"
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei should know that the result is only natural, but, it seems that he does not
        understand the change of heart Chabashira-sensei had.
    </p>
    <p>"Chabashira-sensei became able to laugh, without caring about the expulsions. So, in other
        words, in that special exam, something big happened that changed her mind. Isn’t that right?"
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei and Chabashira-sensei really were formerly fellow students in the advanced
        nurturing high school.
    </p>
    <p>There’s a lot in their past, so it’s no strange thing to be surprised.
    </p>
    <p>"That wasn’t the right thing to ask a student. Please forget about it."
    </p>
    <p>"I understand."
    </p>
    <p>After chatting a bit with Mashima-sensei, I headed for the meeting place, the special building.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        The Cultural Festival is close, but there’s a problem coming along with it that I have to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>This will completely change Ichinose’s class.
    </p>
    <p>The countdown until destruction is moving faster than I had guessed.
    </p>
    <p>I have to make the necessary preparations to avoid that.
    </p>
    <p>This time, I won’t directly contact Ichinose, who is the leader.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that the necessary thing to do now is to cause a transformation on the classmates
        under her.
    </p>
    <p>However, it is necessary to do this very carefully.
    </p>
    <p>The one who possesses enough power to hold that duty, is, of course, that man, and no one
        else.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry to have called you out here."
    </p>
    <p>After classes, when I headed to the meeting place that was discussed in our communications,
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki was already there.
    </p>
    <p>"Do you want something with me?"
    </p>
    <p>I’ve known Kanzaki ever since I enrolled in the school, but I wouldn’t say we’re very friendly.
    </p>
    <p>He seems displeased with my existence lately, and I thought that he hated me.
    </p>
    <p>Well, if he does hate me, that doesn’t mean he wouldn’t come to the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>It’s not a strange thought to think that he wanted to be careful and come talk to me especially
        because he does hate me.
    </p>
    <p>As this is a meeting with no traces of other people around, the possibility is very high.
    </p>
    <p>"The time has come to talk about what happens hereafter"
    </p>
    <p>"Hereafter? Just what do you… Ah, it’s fine. Let me talk first."
    </p>
    <p>Before I could tell him my terms, Kanzaki stopped me in my tracks.
    </p>
    <p>I was surprised about this unexpected move and decided to first hear him out.
    </p>
    <p>"I’ve been worried about something recently. All alone, without asking for help from anyone."
    </p>
    <p>After his words, he corrected himself and spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>"No, it would be exaggerating it if I said I was worried, but, I’ve been thinking every day on how I
        go about things."
    </p>
    <p>His words were not like the usual calm and cool Kanzaki.
    </p>
    <p>Until I needed an answer from him, I decided to play the part of the listener.
    </p>
    <p>"About how I should live my life after this, after school…"
    </p>
    <p>It’s not like he would be worried about his friends or relationships.
    </p>
    <p>There is only one point that the students in this school must care about the most, promotion to
        Class A.
    </p>
    <p>"It might be a bit useless to talk to you about it now, but, my class can’t win."
    </p>
    <p>I wonder what he’s talking about winning against.
    </p>
    <p>Is it the Cultural Festival, or the finals?
    </p>
    <p>No, this can’t end with such an insignificant subject.
    </p>
    <p>It is reality that Ichinose’s class won’t rise up to Class A.
    </p>
    <p>This was a cry for help from Kanzaki, who realizes this already.
    </p>
    <p>"Scholarly ability, exercise, leadership, we’re certainly not that behind the other classes. I feel
        that we’re actually distinguished on some aspects. However, gradually, I’ve come to know that
        this won’t lead to victory."
    </p>
    <p>He understood his own thoughts, and started worrying. As I thought, this was Kanzaki.
    </p>
    <p>"I understand what you want to say. So, what do you want from me, Kanzaki?"
    </p>
    <p>If all he wants is a pair of ears to listen and understand him, then anyone could do that.
    </p>
    <p>"I… I want to get some advice from you about Ichinose."
    </p>
    <p>There’s the reason it had to be me.
    </p>
    <p>The name of the person that is one of our few common interests finally came up.
    </p>
    <p>"No, not just that. I want to ask you what would be the best for our class to do now."
    </p>
    <p>"That’s a big subject. Further, do you ask that of me, someone, who is not even your
        class-mate?"
    </p>
    <p>"…You’re right, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>Looking at Kanzaki’s bitter expression, it’s easy to read his mind.
    </p>
    <p>This man isn’t the type of person who can ask for help from others so easily.
    </p>
    <p>Especially because he was driven into a corner like this, he had to take such a measure.
    </p>
    <p>Well, at first, it would have been unthinkable to even consider this.
    </p>
    <p>He also had the choice of taking everything upon himself all alone.
    </p>
    <p>"She would never care about what I have to say. No, it would be the same with everyone."
    </p>
    <p>"I had recognized that Ichinose was the type of student that would lend an ear to anyone, but…"
    </p>
    <p>"That was only when you were going the same direction as her. No need to even explain it now."
    </p>
    <p>I talked as if I was testing him, but this is also needless.
    </p>
    <p>If I said it in an easy way to understand, if you ask for help to save somebody, Ichinose wouldn’t
        care about the risks, wouldn’t betray you, and help you out until the end. Reversely, if you asked
        for help to meaninglessly entrap someone, she would never help you.
    </p>
    <p>Rightfully judging evil, these may be the words to describe her.
    </p>
    <p>Even if you try to change this with money or other things, it’s no use.
    </p>
    <p>"I won’t say that she’s headed in the wrong direction. But, she’s too idealistic."
    </p>
    <p>"That idealism may actually be necessary."
    </p>
    <p>"Perhaps. I’m prepared to follow along if things are going well."
    </p>
    <p>In truth, Kanzaki and his classmates have been sharing joy and sorrow under while going along
        with Ichinose until now.
    </p>
    <p>"How about now? We’ve lost points because of Ichinose’s policies. We’ve sunk to the bottom,
    </p>
    <p>and can’t even grasp a way to get out."
    </p>
    <p>"You’re talking very openly about this. Are you sure? Is it okay to tell me about your class’
        interior situations in such detail?"
    </p>
    <p>"It’s a stupid plan, huh."
    </p>
    <p>As if laughing at himself, he sighed and whispered so.
    </p>
    <p>"However, even if it’s stupid, a plan is a plan. Right now, I have no other method than to trust
        you."
    </p>
    <p>He turned his sad eyes away from me, and stared at the empty floor of the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>"At the unanimous special exam, I asserted that they should try to get points even if it means
        their class-mates dropping out. I struggled to cast an affirmative note, but that was a misfire
        too."
    </p>
    <p>I don’t know anything about the class’ interior situation, but, in this case, it’s easy to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki agreed to expel the students for the sake of making them understand the reality his
        class is facing.
    </p>
    <p>Then, he kept voting in favor to try and change the awareness inside the class, but no one
        including Ichinose agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>Still, I’ll logically address Kanzaki who has caused an uprising.
    </p>
    <p>Even if he’s not on point, something like this should have happened before.
    </p>
    <p>"…This is a strange conversation."
    </p>
    <p>After not getting a reply, Kanzaki whispered so to himself, as if to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>"No matter if we’re enemies or friends, what are you telling me to do after giving me all this
        information?"
    </p>
    <p>He already decided by himself that he will not get any advice.
    </p>
    <p>He looks like he feels bad about making such a useless move.
    </p>
    <p>"Ichinose is devoted to you. You’re the one person that can change Ichinose’s policies. I’ve
        come to only see it in a straightforward way like that."
    </p>
    <p>"I see."
    </p>
    <p>Change Ichinose’s way of thinking and sense of value, to save the class.
    </p>
    <p>The class itself does not have the power, so the light is shining on someone else.
    </p>
    <p>"So you really do want to change how things are going and escape from this situation you’re
        stuck in."
    </p>
    <p>There was no point talking again, so Kanzaki just nodded deeply.
    </p>
    <p>Something that the frustrated Kanzaki couldn’t see.
    </p>
    <p>This story about changing Ichinose and being saved, such a future is only a dream.
    </p>
    <p>If Ichinose really did change because of my words, could that really be considered as growth?
    </p>
    <p>Can they assault the other classes if Ichinose becomes someone that makes ruthless
        decisions?
    </p>
    <p>Erasing what would be called strenghts, to make weaknesses disappear.
    </p>
    <p>There’s no proof that you can go back if you change directions into that way.
    </p>
    <p>"I agree that the way it’s going needs to be changed. However, I don’t agree with the method."
    </p>
    <p>"There’s no other choice. You’re the only one that can make Ichinose move."
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder. Don’t you think there’s someone more fitting than me?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don’t."
    </p>
    <p>For Kanzaki, who had no other ideas, this was a disappointing conversation.
    </p>
    <p>"Actually, I’ve called another student here today other than you."
    </p>
    <p>"Who?"
    </p>
    <p>You could say that it is the person you’d expect the least to show up in this place.
    </p>
    <p>"There’s no way you called Ichinose, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Unfortunately, it’s not Ichinose. It’s a student that has the power to change this course of
        events."
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry to hinder you, but there’s no one in my class except me that can talk against Ichinose. I
        have enough experience to understand that."
    </p>
    <p>"Your point of view is quite narrow, Kanzaki."
    </p>
    <p>"What?"
    </p>
    <p>"Ichinose’s class seems like a monolith, but it’s not that simple. There are also a lot of students
        who just cobble together others’ thoughts and get carried away by their environment."
    </p>
    <p>I replied so, but it looked like Kanzaki didn’t understand.
    </p>
    <p>I understand why that is too.
    </p>
    <p>He doesn’t want to make his own classmates feel unsafe so readily.
    </p>
    <p>"Why is Ichinose’s class losing its position, and facing danger?"
    </p>
    <p>Where would I reach if I kept climbing up the error chain?
    </p>
    <p>It’s necessary to make Kanzaki and the others understand that.
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? Why is Kanzaki-kun here too?"
    </p>
    <p>She must have thought there wasn’t anyone but me here, so Himeno seemed very surprised.
    </p>
    <p>She was a bit earlier than planned, but this was actually great timing.
    </p>
    <p>"Himeno? You were in contact with Ayanokoji?"
    </p>
    <p>"Kinda."
    </p>
    <p>Most people think that she never gets involved in school.
    </p>
    <p>Not just Kanzaki, but all the other students should have the same opinion.
    </p>
    <p>"I certainly can’t believe that Himeno is the more fitting person that you were talking about."
    </p>
    <p>In our school life so far, I can mostly understand what kind of image Kanzaki has had of
        Himeno.
    </p>
    <p>Same as all the other students.
    </p>
    <p>"I’ll prove that from now on."
    </p>
    <p>"Wait a bit. It looks like you’re talking about me, but what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>After being called here like this, it’s normal for Himeno to be suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>"That’s… No, wait."
    </p>
    <p>"What is all this, Ayanokoji?"
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>"You called me here, but just what do you intend to talk about? It seems like you called Himeno
        here on purpose too, so this almost looks like, from the start…"
    </p>
    <p>He suddenly stopped talking and looked at me and Himeno.
    </p>
    <p>"What, what, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Today, I foresaw that you wanted some advice about the class… Were you yourself thinking
        about bringing change to our class? No, it would be meaningless for you to think about that, or
        to put that into action…"
    </p>
    <p>I called Kanzaki here, and before I started talking to him, he told me all about the situation in his
        class.
    </p>
    <p>It feels unnatural for Himeno to arrive with this timing, and go along with the talks.
    </p>
    <p>"You… Just how much can you really see?"
    </p>
    <p>Since Kanzaki started the conversation, he ended up unexpectedly understanding my plans.
    </p>
    <p>As a result, it seems that this caused Kanzaki to be very surprised.
    </p>
    <p>"Let’s get to the main subject. I’ll tell you why I called you here today, Kanzaki. It’s not necessary
        for me to change Ichinose. What needs to change, is the class’ opinion. If the class’ opinion
        changes, it would also bring about a transformation to Ichinose."
    </p>
    <p>"…It’s useless. I’ve learned that all too well by now."
    </p>
    <p>"By yourself, yes. But, if there are two of you? Three? If everyone except Ichinose had changed
        their minds, the Unanimous Special Exam’s results would have changed, too."
    </p>
    <p>"Changing everyone’s minds is a dream in a dream. Besides, even if we could do that, would
        the result really have changed? Ichinose didn’t wish for the expulsions from the start, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"I really can’t think that Ichinose, who cares about the class, would go along with expelling
        people from the school, but, it’s another story if the Unanimous Special Exam ends in failure and
        we receive a penalty."
    </p>
    <p>"Wait a bit. Ichinose-san will protect her class-mates, even if she receives a heavy penalty."
    </p>
    <p>At last, Himeno who was a mere bystander until now opened her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>"While 39 people are against it, could Ichinose really endure until the end?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course, it’s Ichinose-san. Isn’t that right, Kanzaki-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>"I think so too, but… It’s certain that there will be some contradictions occuring."
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose will fight with all she has for the sake of her classmates.
    </p>
    <p>However, if there’s opposition from all of her classmates, I wonder what would happen then.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a different problem if even after she understands that she’s doing the wrong thing, she
        continues to vote in opposition.
    </p>
    <p>Even if she succeeds, what awaits her after would be self-loathing.
    </p>
    <p>All that’s left would be the reality that her class-mates lost points because of her.
    </p>
    <p>"Ichinose, after being affected badly by her self-condemnation, might not be able to properly
        continue her duty as a leader."
    </p>
    <p>"That would be the worst possible result, wouldn’t it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. Ichinose would not wish for such a development. So, what do you think really happened?
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki."
    </p>
    <p>"If all of our classmates, same as me, agreed to the expulsions?"
    </p>
    <p>While understanding it isn’t a realistic scenario, we will simulate it.
    </p>
    <p>"Being prepared to run out of time, if all 39 students continued voting in favour, Ichinose will
        eventually change sides. Then, she will try to get herself expelled… Right?"
    </p>
    <p>The answer came out right away.
    </p>
    <p>The class, succeeding in gaining points by expelling Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>However, they also threw away their benefactor Ichinose at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>"Impossible, I say. If such a development happened, the disadvantages would be way too
        many."
    </p>
    <p>Ichinose withdrawing from her own class.
    </p>
    <p>It would be an unexpected development, but this would help Kanzaki out.
    </p>
    <p>"Of course, I don’t want to tell Ichinose to drop out. Just, if her classmates change, then the
        class will change too. I think that we should change the opinion of the class instead of changing
        Ichinose. The ones to start that, are you, Kanzaki, and Himeno."
    </p>
    <p>"M-.. Me?"
    </p>
    <p>"I know you don’t agree with everything Ichinose is doing. Unlike her other classmates, you can
        be suspicious of her, like Kanzaki. Right?"
    </p>
    <p>"That’s…"
    </p>
    <p>"When Kanzaki showed opposition at the Unanimous Special Test, what did you think?"
    </p>
    <p>"…"
    </p>
    <p>Himeno silently hung her head low.
    </p>
    <p>"Tell me. I want to know what you’re thinking."
    </p>
    <p>"I thought that it was pointless. The class won’t change easily. They’re so intent on being nice
        and making themselves the victim instead of their friends."
    </p>
    <p>She quickly started talking about how she felt.
    </p>
    <p>"I felt that Kanzaki-kun’s resistance was a simple waste of time. So, I wanted that painful time to
        end quickly, and for him to come to his senses… That’s what I told him."
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps because he remembered that time, Kanzaki shut his eyes and hung his head slightly.
    </p>
    <p>"When you heard those words from Himeno, you grasped that she was the same as the other
        class-mates, right? You should have come to grips with what Himeno said, that you shouldn’t
        waste time, and that it’s no choice at all to throw away your class-mates."
    </p>
    <p>Without denying it, Kanzaki nodded once.
    </p>
    <p>"However, the reality was different. Himeno herself has a problem with the way the class is."
    </p>
    <p>"Then, why won’t she put that to words? Not just at the Unanimous Special Exam, but she could
        have talked about it any time."
    </p>
    <p>A conversation started that I couldn’t bud into, as I didn’t understand the circumstances of the
        class.
    </p>
    <p>Normally, the talks shouldn’t have been happening here.
    </p>
    <p>Even if they let an outsider like me hear about it, normally it would not have any benefits for
        them.
    </p>
    <p>However, right now, it’s the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>We can get a pledge from Himeno, precisely because I’m here too.
    </p>
    <p>In summary, if they let this chance go, they will go back to the normal daily routine of the
        Ichinose Class.
    </p>
    <p>"Ahh…"
    </p>
    <p>Himeno’s eyes did not show the full extent of her feelings, like Kanzaki’s.
    </p>
    <p>"Don’t make it sound so simple."
    </p>
    <p>While letting out a sigh, she averted her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>"You get it even if I don’t answer, right? Our class has nothing but strong peer pressure. Even if I
        think something is white, if the majority says that it’s black, it becomes black. It doesn’t matter if
        it’s true or not. There’s no point to a minority faction making proposals in a class like that. It’s
        nothing but pain to have people try to convince you that something is white even though you’re
        sure that it’s black. That’s why I said nothing until now, and I have no intention to say anything
        from now on either."
    </p>
    <p>"But, if you don’t say anything, white will be black forever."
    </p>
    <p>"That’s just fine. I’ll accept everyone’s arbitrary assertions that it’s black. Because the color I’m
        thinking in my heart still won’t change."
    </p>
    <p>Himeno’s manners made clear that she didn’t care that this was the class’ reality, she simply
        accepted it.
    </p>
    <p>"Kanzaki-kun, you lost heart while trying way too hard to convince people too, right? That’s
        because it was forcefully painted black and overwritten, even though you believed that it was
        white. That must be hard to endure, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Useless labour. Himeno chose to go with the flow to avoid such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>No, this isn’t just Himeno.
    </p>
    <p>It’s the same for the other students in the Ichinose Class.
    </p>
    <p>"I want you to stop thinking of me as an ally. Sorry, but I can’t be as passionate as you,
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki-kun."
    </p>
    <p>As if trying to get away from Kanzaki away after he approached her, she took a step back.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you really fine with the class staying this way?"
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki had decided at first that Himeno was no different than his other class-mates.
    </p>
    <p>However, before I noticed, he was trying to convince Himeno while ignoring me.
    </p>
    <p>"Leaving that aside, the important thing for me is just to protect myself, so. I’m not gonna
        become friendly with anyone, but I won’t be anyone’s enemy, either. There are times I’m invited,
    </p>
    <p>and times that I’m not. I don’t want to break that sense of distance, that atmosphere."
    </p>
    <p>She doesn’t want to rock the boat, it’s not a bad idea at all.
    </p>
    <p>However, with that, the class will never move forwards.
    </p>
    <p>"Kanzaki, if you’re able to convince more than half the class, I’ll come over to that side, too.
    </p>
    <p>You’re fine with that, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Himeno decisively said that she has no intention of ever being a part of the minority.
    </p>
    <p>"Ugh..!"
    </p>
    <p>Her true motives, and her reluctance were clear from her words.
    </p>
    <p>If she joins Kanzaki’s rebellion, what awaits her is an attack from the majority.
    </p>
    <p>Until she lets go of her own thoughts, this will repeat over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>"Can I go already? I won’t tell anyone about this. If I did, it would only be trouble for me, so."
    </p>
    <p>I wonder what Kanzaki will do as Himeno tries to leave.
    </p>
    <p>If he lets her go like this, there will be no transformation brought about to the class.
    </p>
    <p>"…Please wait."
    </p>
    <p>"I don’t want to wait, though."
    </p>
    <p>"I didn’t want to tell anyone about this, but, I’m actually trying to do something very decisive
        myself."
    </p>
    <p>"What’s that?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don’t intend to sink with Ichinose and the class forever."
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki let Himeno know his thoughts which he had not put to words until now.
    </p>
    <p>"You’re saying… You’re going to betray the class?"
    </p>
    <p>"I won’t deny it. Because, it’s pointless to stay with a class that can’t win."
    </p>
    <p>If Kanzaki leaves, the rebellion’s signal won’t fire.
    </p>
    <p>Under the current circumstances, Kanzaki is the only one that can get ahead of Ichinose.
    </p>
    <p>"I’m not trying to threaten you. But, I’ll say that much, at least."
    </p>
    <p>If Kanzaki did leave the class somehow, it still wouldn’t have any effect on Himeno personally.
    </p>
    <p>However, she must at least understand that it would mean the class would lose its chance to
        climb up.
    </p>
    <p>Himeno is worried. She showed a reaction that was completely different to her demeanor until
        now.
    </p>
    <p>"You get that, right? Himeno."
    </p>
    <p>"So cunning. That is a threat…"
    </p>
    <p>"I guess you could see it that way, too."
    </p>
    <p>Himeno may tell Ichinose and the others about this sign of betrayal.
    </p>
    <p>Leaving Ichinose aside, one may think that the class members will work towards stopping
        Kanzaki from getting the right to change classes, so this is very risky.
    </p>
    <p>"…Do you really intend to change classes?"
    </p>
    <p>"I can’t say anything that will make you happy, but, what Ayanokouji said is true. I want to
        believe that changing Ichinose by our hands is the way to save the class."
    </p>
    <p>"But, I…"
    </p>
    <p>Biting her lower lip, Himeno strongly closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>It is unavoidable that Himeno will get the cold shoulder if she allies with Kanzaki, who is alone
        and isolated.
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki understands well that this is not what she wants.
    </p>
    <p>Still, someone has to do it.
    </p>
    <p>"…I… If I can win, I want to win."
    </p>
    <p>Himeno is softening up after Kanzaki showed her the possibility that he may disappear.
    </p>
    <p>But, she isn’t all in yet.
    </p>
    <p>"In that case, we have to move now. Isn’t that right?"
    </p>
    <p>If Himeno doesn’t make a move now, Kanzaki really will lose his chance.
    </p>
    <p>Even if he doesn’t want to make that choice, Kanzaki has to change his policy and aim for
        victory by transferring to another class.
    </p>
    <p>With that, Himeno, who can’t say that black is black, will certainly face defeat.
    </p>
    <p>"I understand what you want to say… But, right now…"
    </p>
    <p>"You intend to tell me that there’s still a chance we can win with Ichinose’s policies, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Kanzaki’s words that interrupted Himeno strongly pierced into her.
    </p>
    <p>Without being able to continue speaking, she heavily closed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>"Don’t you want to graduate in the A class, Himeno?"
    </p>
    <p>The words stabbed into her heart like a spear. Painful, enough to make her bleed.
    </p>
    <p>"If I can graduate in the A-Class, of course, I want to!"
    </p>
    <p>Her loud voice echoed through the corridors.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it was louder than expected, and Kanzaki lost his words in shock.
    </p>
    <p>"But, as things are right now, I can’t think of anything to do! There’s nothing to do, I’m telling
        you!"
    </p>
    <p>Himeno yelled so with passion.
    </p> <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image2.webp" alt="">
<p>
"Kanzaki-kun, even you understand that, right?"
</p><p>"I get it, of course!! That’s why I’m saying that we have to do it now! I don’t want to lose to the
other classes!"
</p><p>He can’t keep up with Himeno, but Kanzaki unexpectadly yelled so, and Himeno was the one in
shock this time.
</p><p>Looking at her face and seeing her falter, my conviction was renewed.
</p><p>Himeno showing her true self for the first time, and, Kanzaki’s child-like face.
</p><p>There must be a lot of students in the Ichinose class that only want it to look like they’re
invested in the class.
</p><p>After half a year, the Horikita class exposed their weak points.
</p><p>They prioritize themselves as model students, and don’t care about others being expelled.
</p><p>They can’t study, discuss things, and quickly turn to violence.
</p><p>They get close to the people who have the power in order to get higher positions.
</p><p>In order to make their past disappear, they plan the expulsion of their allies.
</p><p>Such weak hearted students, fell down to the bottom, and crawled back up. On one side,
</p><p>they’ve shown unbelievable growth.
</p><p>"…Kanzaki-kun, seeing you like that… You’re always so calm, so I was surprised."
</p><p>"…Same for me. I didn’t know you had such thoughts, Himeno."
</p><p>The Ichinose class didn’t have the simply hardships that the Horikita class had.
</p><p>If they find someone that has fallen and is hurt, they help them with a heavy hand, and support
them from both sides so that they don’t fall again.
</p><p>Keep helping those who have hurt their hands.
</p><p>Why did they fall? Why did they hurt their hands?
</p><p>Actually, it hurts a lot worse, but they held it down in order not to raise any concerns.
</p><p>What came with that, is the Ichinose class which was constructed with superficial relationships.
</p><p>"The time has come to become true allies."
</p><p>After staying silent, I said so to the two.
</p><p>"However, what should we do? How can be progress forwards? Even if we can change
Himeno’s opinion, if we don’t keep going after that, then there’s no meaning."
</p><p>"There’s no need to rush the answer. We will search for them together from now on."
</p><p>"Search… What do you mean?"
</p><p>"Students who hold their true feelings secret, like you."
</p><p>Even if I can’t do it alone, with these two, my field of vision is many times larger.
</p><p>With a change of view, many new discoveries will come our way.
</p><p>"If… If we do find someone?"
</p><p>"It’s simple. This time, we’ll search with 3 people. Then, make it 4. We’ll just repeat that over and
over."
</p><p>One day, a small ember will turn into a large flame.
</p><p>Then, Ichinose will know about it, too.
</p><p>That the class is trying to change.
</p><p>"It’s not too late yet. Become strong. Then, prove that you can defeat the class that Horikita is
leading in the year-end exams."
</p><p>If they do that, when they go up to Year Two, they should still have some hope for becoming A
Class.
</p><p>"…What will we do, Kanzaki-kun?"
</p><p>"You must have the resolve to suffer more than you can imagine. However… It’s not
impossible."
</p><p>After seeing the real example of Himeno, he can’t say that she doesn’t exist in the class again.
</p><p>On one side, Himeno should have been able to get close to Kanzaki’s strong will and
understand it.
</p><p>"I want to graduate in the A-Class, too. Until now, I couldn’t say it to anyone, but…"
</p><p>By some way or other, Himeno’s thoughts were conveyed to Kanzaki
"That’s… That’s right. Our target hasn’t changed at all since the start."
</p><p>Now, they’re taking their first steps, like a baby.
</p><p>"Umm… After hearing what Ayanokoji had to say, there’s someone I’m curious about. After this,
</p><p>if it’s okay, can we go meet them?"
</p><p>After hearing Himeno’s proposal, Kanzaki nodded strongly.
</p><p>As the third person here, this isn’t territory that I should step into.
</p><p>"Ayanokoji, I’m going to return this gift at the year-end exam."
</p><p>Does he mean winning, and getting the rights to challenge the A Class?
</p><p>"The Horikita Class is strong, Kanzaki."
</p><p>"You’re right. …Sorry, I’m going. I actually don’t want to waste even a minute or a second, so."
</p><p>Himeno also nodded, took out her phone, turned her back to Kanzaki and started walking.
</p><p>I was a bit worried about just how far those two would change, but I might actually somehow get
a result that is even more than I expected.
</p><p>In the year-end exam, the Horikita Class may actually break.
</p><p>No matter which way it goes, it won’t hinder my plans, but now I have one more thing to look
forward to.
