    <h1>Epilogue</h1>
    <h2>The People Behind The Scenes</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
        When 4:00 PM finally arrived, the hectic cultural festival was over.
    </p>
    <p>Sales cannot now be recorded since, as previously stated, the accounting application was
        forcibly shut down.
    </p>
    <p>Starting at 6 p.m., two hours later, the results could well be viewed on a cell phone.
    </p>
    <p>Even though it's over, there is no change in the fact that the usual response to guests is
        required until the end.
    </p>
    <p>Due to the closing of the store, the guests who stayed until the end began to leave their seats.
    </p>
    <p>Those guests while leaving were telling the students their impressions of the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>Positive remarks like "it was interesting" and "it was fun" were made by all of them. Those kind
        words really moved the students who had put in so much effort during the event, and their
        exhaustion seemed to vanish.
    </p>
    <p>By the way, as soon as it was four o'clock, Chabashira-sensei ran away from the classroom like
        a scared rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here - 脱兎 (datto) is used. Meaning - dashing or bounding away; with lightning
        speed. But generally (in this) used as an expression like running away like a scared rabbit. ]
    </p>
    <p>I think it would stand out if you ran around in that outfit, but let's leave it alone.
    </p>
    <p>It was around 5:30 when all the guests left and all the classmates (except Koenji) gathered at
        the maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>"Everyone did a great job. Even though a lot happened, the festival was at least able to come to
        a successful conclusion. The sales, in my opinion, could not have been any better."
    </p>
    <p>Ike and the others gathered in the classroom having just finished taking down the outdoor stalls.
    </p>
    <p>There were still some spots to clean up in the maid cafe because some guests stayed around
        late to eat, but Horikita stepped up to conclude the cultural festival.
    </p>
    <p>"The results will be announced later, but there is something I want to talk to you about before
        that."
    </p>
    <p>Yes, there were 37 students in the classroom. Akito and Haruka also remained behind.
    </p>
    <p>Haruka, who became the center of attraction here, took a step forward, without being prompted
        by Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>"I would like to be the first to tell you. I have not forgiven everyone here."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka mumbled in the silence of the classroom as she opened her speech.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the students, expecting her to start with an apology, looked at each other, feeling more
        bewilderment than anger.
    </p>
    <p>They didn't appear to be blaming her. Everyone understood. They were mature enough to
        understand what it was like to lose a best friend.
    </p>
    <p>"But the person I can't forgive the most is myself. I assumed that everyone who left the school
        would be unhappy. Yamauchi-kun, who disappeared last year, and Airi."
    </p>
    <p>At the mention of Yamauchi's name, Sudo, Ike, and the others seemed to be thinking back.
    </p>
    <p>"I had assumed it would be best for Airi to continue her education here. I figured that would be
        the happiest course of action. That’s why I despised everyone. …and wanted revenge."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka clutched the skirt of her school uniform tightly as she expressed her frustration.
    </p>
    <p>"After this festival ended, I was going to leave school."
    </p>
    <p>She didn't have to admit it, but she didn't want to keep it a secret, so she did. Although most of
        the students kept quiet about it, I believe some of them had anticipated it.
    </p>
    <p>"I was going to go along with Haruka too."
    </p>
    <p>At this point, Akito, too, could not remain silent and told the truth with Haruka.
    </p>
    <p>"If we had dropped out, our class would not have reached Class A. It's the easiest and most
        powerful way to get revenge."
    </p>
    <p>No tricks would be needed. Just leaving school was enough to make us lose a large number of
        class points.
    </p>
    <p>"But if you can give me a chance, please let me stay in this class."
    </p>
    <p>"You've had a change of heart, haven't you?"
    </p>
    <p>"She is trying to spread her wings in the outside world. Kushida-san told me about it."
    </p>
    <p>When Kushida's name was mentioned, everyone turned their attention to her. Kushida
        attempted to add something as most of them were confused by what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>"Sakura-san, she seems to be working hard to become an idol; you can find her on SNS, so
        maybe you can ask Hasebe-san to show you later."
    </p>
    <p>Some students were surprised, others thought it was a good. But the common perception that
        emerged was the fact that Airi had taken a new step forward.
    </p>
    <p>"Airi will grow a lot. Probably more than I thought she would. So I want to be able to graduate in
        Class A and go see her. I want to be able to show myself without embarrassment."
    </p>
    <p>The class learned that this was why she chose to stay at this school.
    </p>
    <p>"You made a good decision, Hasebe-san."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to accept punishment for the trouble I caused."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm just as guilty. I didn't help with most of the festival and caused trouble for the class."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita stepped forward before the other students could say anything unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>"Even though skipping the festival is a negative thing, it doesn't break any rules. It's the same
        thing because Koenji-kun hasn't appeared once since this morning."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita approached Haruka with a look of dismay and relief on her face.
    </p>
    <p>"If you are going to be punished, it will only be by remaining classmates with me. Can you face
        that reality?"
    </p>
    <p>I wonder what Haruka thought of the reflection in Horikita's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to try my best. Yes. From now on, you can think of me as your regular Hasebe-san,
    </p>
    <p>okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry. I won't bother you."
    </p>
    <p>That was enough, Horikita nodded and declared.
    </p>
    <p>"Miyake-kun is the same as before as well. Isn’t he?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course."
    </p>
    <p>"That's all for today then. Let's all finish the rest of the cleanup quickly."
    </p>
    <p>Keisei walked up to Haruka and Akito, somewhat hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p>Starting with Akito's apology, Keisei's eyes reddened a bit and he spoke with relief.
    </p>
    <p>The three of them came together for the first time in a while thanks to Haruka's apologies, and
        they grinned faintly at one another. Akito and Keisei turned their attention to Haruka as if they
        had made up their minds.
    </p>
    <p>The two of them signaled to Haruka as well, and the eyes of those three turned to me in
        confusion.
    </p>
    <p>If I were to approach them here and now, the group might be resumed.
    </p>
    <p>That was no longer necessary.
    </p>
    <p>I turned my back and went to send words of thanks to Sato and the others.
    </p>
    <p>The group of five was now three, but I hoped that the bond between them would be stronger
        than before.
    </p>
    <p>That place doesn't need me.
    </p>
    <p>The three of them could sense my actions as a sign of farewell. They didn't approach me or call
        out to me.
    </p>
    <p>It was quick after that.
    </p>
    <p>The cleanup that was left to be done would soon be back on track with 37 people.
    </p>
    <p>All the cleanup was done before 6:00 PM.
    </p>
    <p>Then the results of the festival were announced.
    </p>
    <p class="center italic">
        1st place, 2nd year B class (+ 100 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">2nd place, 2nd year C class (+ 100 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">3rd place, 3rd year B class (+ 100 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">4th place, 2nd year A class (+ 100 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">5th place, 1st year A class (+ 50 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">6th place, 3rd year C class (+ 50 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">7th place, 2nd year D class (+ 50 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">8th place, 1st year C class (+ 50 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">9th place, 3rd year D class (+ 0 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">10th place, 1st year B class (+ 0 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">11th place, 3rd year A class (+ 0 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center">12th place, 1st year D class (+ 0 Class points)
    </p>
    <p class="italic center"></p>
    <p>
        "We're in first place! We did it!"
    </p>
    <p>"I guess Chabashira-sensei's cosplay really struck!"
    </p>
    <p>Each was pleased and praised each other for a good fight.
    </p>
    <p>"But Ryuen's place is also in second place, and Sakayanagi's class is in fourth place, as
        expected."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here, also the word ‘Sasuga’ is used. But in this sentence it is used for a
        compliment. So, this doesn’t carry the same meaning as before and hence translated as ‘As
        expected’. ]
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, everything is going according to plan."
    </p>
    <p>It was a certainty that Horikita's class would take the top place, and it was assumed from the
        beginning that Ryuen's class would also be in the top position.
    </p>
    <p>"I was wondering how ‘Ichiren Takusho’ would play out, but you managed to outsmart them."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : In the Japanese Text the word ‘Ichirentakusho’ is used which is a saying in
        Japanese. It means to be together throughout life until death, whether it may be in hardship or in
        happiness. But in this Context this could be referred as ; being in the same boat, facing the
        same challenge/fate. Implying to the situation between their class and ryuen’s class (ie. being in
        the same boat aiming for 1st place with facing challenges ) ]
    </p>
    <p>"But there was also something unexpected: Sakayanagi came in fourth."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. Did you see their performance?
    </p>
    <p>"No, I didn't go to the third floor of the special wing today. Did you see them?"
    </p>
    <p>"Class A was selling brochures and stuff about the school for a low price. They didn't have any
        other food, drink, or other offerings. I wonder what kind of tricks they used ……."
    </p>
    <p>"The clue is probably at the bottom of the list."
    </p>
    <p>"First year Class D, Housen-kun's class, right? What about it?"
    </p>
    <p>"If they were the bottom of the class as a result of a struggle, fine. But that's unthinkable. The
        class's entertainment, which was mainly a reenactment of the festival, was quite successful. I
        thought it was one of the top classes, and I don’t think they should have been any lower than
        the third year Class A?"
    </p>
    <p>"The 11th-ranked class is third-year Class A. They were priced out of the competition from the
        start. It was only about entertaining to please the guests, right?"
    </p>
    <p>It was confirmed that the haunted house and other activities could be played for 100 points. On
        the other hand, the shooting and other stalls that Hosen had set up were priced appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>"The top class got 100 points for this festival. It means that behind the scenes, Hosen might
        have gotten something else."
    </p>
    <p>"Conceivably, you mean private points?"
    </p>
    <p>"Doesn't this remind you of last year's desert island test?"
    </p>
    <p>There was an agreement between Ryuen and Katsuragi to receive private points in exchange
        for letting them earn class points.
    </p>
    <p>It would not surprise me if something similar happened between Sakayanagi and Hōsen.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not impossible. Or maybe they signed a similar contract to replace it."
    </p>
    <p>Accounting is done through cell phones. If Hosen and his class received cell phones from the
        2nd year A class for accounting purposes and donated all sales, this would be a viable enough
        strategy.
    </p>
    <p>If they were also providing funds to Hosen's class for the festival, it would make sense for the
        size of their stalls.
    </p>
    <p>"So, she did that, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"If you notice, she's now going for victory."
    </p>
    <p>Either way, it means that Sakayanagi simply is not intending to give the position easily.
    </p>
    <p>There is no doubt that they intended to steadily produce results by making it look as if they have
        abandoned the competition.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        The meeting was then dismissed, but Horikita called some of them to Class B classroom. With
        the exception of Matsushita, who was not present because of illness, they were the three maid
        cafe organisers.
    </p>
    <p>"Actually, I have something I have to apologize to you guys for."
    </p>
    <p>"What? Apologize for what? What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>Despite the challenging nature of the day, Horikita had not displayed any faults on any given
        occasion.
    </p>
    <p>Since Sato and the others had absolutely nothing in mind, they tilted their heads curiously.
    </p>
    <p>"You remember how Ryuen-kun leaked the maid cafe information and how it spread throughout
        the school, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. It was a little panicky there, wasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Actually, it was already decided from the beginning that he would leak the maid cafe."
    </p>
    <p>My idea that we somehow team up in order to work together and take the top spots at the
        festival is what inspired the story.
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean, the leak was already decided?"
    </p>
    <p>"It was all planned. Ryuen-kun and I would work together, he would betray us and make the
        maid cafe's performance known."
    </p>
    <p>"What? No way!"
    </p>
    <p>Of course they would be surprised. Horikita and I were the only ones in the class who knew
        about this.
    </p>
    <p>"So you also had a bet where the winner gets private points?"
    </p>
    <p>"That was Ryuen-kun's idea. I was a little nervous when he suddenly said it."
    </p>
    <p>"Hashimoto and the others, who had been looking forward to the result, must have decided to
        talk about the bet."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, Sakayanagi-san heard a lot of information from third parties. I’m sure that Hashimoto-kun
        and other spies must’ve told her about this as well. The two classes were supposed to
        cooperate with each other, but they got into a dispute, and Ryuen-kun unilaterally betrayed
        them."
    </p>
    <p>"Then what about the one million points you’d get if you won first place?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but we've also confirmed that in fact, no matter who won, no points will be handed
        over to either of them. He was willing to do it himself, but I think he's a bit chilled by now."
    </p>
    <p>With the exception of Horikita, I kept this information a secret from our classmates, including
        Kei. And nobody in Ryuen's class knew about it besides him and Katsuragi.
    </p>
    <p>Even close associates such as Ishizaki and Albert were no exception.
    </p>
    <p>That was why I could only take it as a sign that Ryuen was serious about keeping the
        agreement.
    </p>
    <p>"One of their strategies was to put up a Japanese-style concept cafe as a rival. Besides
        appealing to the public that we were enemies, it was also to keep other rivals out."
    </p>
    <p>Rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>The higher the excitement, the more responsibility the adults have and the more money they
        drop.
    </p>
    <p>Knowing that there is a battle that neither side can afford to lose, it is natural to want a side to
        win.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, other classes and grades were not in a fight to the death.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, many classes wanted class points, but the amount of heat was one or two times
        lower than the Horikita vs. Ryuen battle.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm really sorry. I even kept quiet to you guys, even though I was trying to win."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita constantly felt bad since she wanted to share the plan as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>She was genuinely sorry, and I'm sure the three of them could tell that.
    </p>
    <p>"It's okay. We were first in the results, hey?"
    </p>
    <p>Not particularly blaming us, Sato happily confirmed to Mii-chan and Maezono.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, you know. If you do well, I guess I don’t mind so much."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. If I had been told beforehand, it might have shown on my face."
    </p>
    <p>Mii-chan replied honestly,
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not even sure I'm confident enough to act."
    </p>
    <p>"Good for you, Horikita."
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, it's a weight off my shoulders. You guys can tell Matsushita-san about this. And as soon as
        the private points are transferred to us, we'll pay you all."
    </p>
    <p>"We did it!"
    </p>
    <p>The three of them high-fived each other.
    </p>
    <p>"Was Chabashira-sensei becoming a maid also discussed from the beginning? That was
        probably the biggest surprise."
    </p>
    <p>"That was amazing… we were on top of the scores within an hour."
    </p>
    <p>"I know you have a lot to talk about, but we're going to end today off. Thank you so much."
    </p>
    <p>The class found a strategy in the suggestion of a maid cafe and was able to win first place.
    </p>
    <p>I was grateful that other uncalculated factors also worked positively.
    </p>
    <p>After seeing the three of them off, only Horikita and I were left in the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>A slightly stronger wind came through the open window and shook the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you sure you’re okay with it? Most of the plan was your own idea. You could’ve claimed
        more credit, you know? Staging the confrontation and making Chabashira-sensei the maid, it
        was undeniably your ability that contributed to the first place."
    </p>
    <p>"It was only possible because of Horikita's position as leader."
    </p>
    <p>"If it had been you in the past, you wouldn't have included me in this plan, would you?"
    </p>
    <p>In the empty classroom, Horikita muttered without looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>"I think so."
    </p>
    <p>"You don't deny it."
    </p>
    <p>"It's a fact, so it can't be helped. You knew it too, that's why you asked me, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, yeah, that's probably true."
    </p>
    <p>It's not that I, Ryuen, and Katsuragi couldn't have forced the issue by ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>However, I did not hesitate to tell Horikita at the same time when I made this proposal.
    </p>
    <p>I wasn’t sure if she could play the role or not, but it was not something that could be done
        without the leader.
    </p>
    <p>If the proposal had been completely rejected, I would’ve been fine with it.
    </p>
    <p>"I wouldn’t hesitate to consider deceiving my colleagues if it’s an effective means to win. When
        it's time to proceed, I will proceed, even if it's at a risk. Do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>The idea of creating strategies herself became more ingrained in Horikita's body.
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe now I can understand. I think I'm starting to see it, little by little."
    </p>
    <p>It may not be a very strong feeling yet, but she was definitely getting a feel for it.
    </p>
    <p>"That's enough for today. The sun will be setting soon."
    </p>
    <p>"Wait. Ayanokoji-kun, I really need to ask you something right now."
    </p>
    <p>I tried to get Horikita to leave, but I had a feeling she wouldn't. Horikita and Ibuki's presence in
        the student council room didn't seem to be a coincidence, in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>That must be the case as they followed some form of thread to get there.
    </p>
    <p>"What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Today's cultural festival. A serious incident that was happening behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>……Ayanokoji-kun—---"
    </p>
    <p>Conveniently or not, my cell phone rang at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, hold on a second."
    </p>
    <p>"Eh, yeah."
    </p>
    <p>When I looked at the screen, it was a call from an unknown number.
    </p>
    <p>"Hello?"
    </p>
    <p>"Are you still in school? I'd like to talk to you for a minute if you'd like."
    </p>
    <p>The voice sounded familiar: It was Tsubaki Sakurako, a student in first year Class C.
    </p>
    <p>I didn't care how she got my number, as there were so many different ways to get it, but she
        was an unexpected person.
    </p>
    <p>I’m not surprised as to why she made contact today.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you alone now?"
    </p>
    <p>"Unfortunately not."
    </p>
    <p>"Then why don't we meet up?"
    </p>
    <p>"Where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>"I just left the front door. You're still on campus, right?
    </p>
    <p>"Give me five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>"Okay."
    </p>
    <p>After a short call, I told Horikita,
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to step out for a bit…I'll be back in about 10 or 20 minutes. Then
        we'll continue our conversation."
    </p>
    <p>"Okay, I'll wait here."
    </p>
    <p>I promised to come back here and left the classroom. Once I was alone, I decided to call the
        person who had helped me the most today.
    </p>
    <p>"The third-year’s information network is top-notch; whether it was Kushida Kikyo or Hasebe
        Haruka, you’re able to find them immediately. I've once again realized the power of Student
        Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>"Did you call me to say that?"
    </p>
    <p>"I just wanted to thank you in advance. You were very helpful in today's search."
    </p>
    <p>The number of eyes and the leadership among the third-year students who quickly located
        Haruka and Kushida were magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>"I never thought you'd use the strategy I used on you for your own benefit."
    </p>
    <p>"It was helpful that you were able to tell me what was going on in the student council room.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to you, I was able to respond quickly."
    </p>
    <p>"At first, I thought it was Yagami's crazy delusion, but was there actually a trick to that letter?"
    </p>
    <p>"It seems to be a love letter to Student Council President Nagumo, but as Yagami complained, it
        had a somewhat complicated anagram in it. If someone deciphers it, they arrive at the sentence,
    </p>
    <p>‘I have an important meeting in the student council room after 3:00 p.m.’ I also mixed in a few
        other words that I thought would be interesting. If he had a strong interest, he would naturally
        take me up on the offer."
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the anagram, the love letter had a few other little touches.
    </p>
    <p>The letter's envelope, along with the stickers holding it together, were available to anyone at any
        time at the Keyaki Mall.
    </p>
    <p>If they had been custom-made and purchased online, Yagami could have been hesitant due to
        his concern that the contents might be discovered and that traces of them would be left behind.
    </p>
    <p>However, if you looked at the Keyaki Mall, you would see that everything except for the
        handwritten letterhead was replaceable.
    </p>
    <p>That’s why he could check the contents without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, by writing directly, I could inform Yagami of the handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>The calligraphy training the White Room students received ensured that their handwriting was of
        the highest calibre.
    </p>
    <p>The love letter prepared in this way was passed to Horikita through another girl using Kei.
    </p>
    <p>Then, she was led to hand it to Yagami, giving him time to examine it.
    </p>
    <p>I made him act like he was in a terrible mood that day so that Horikita couldn't hand it over right
        away since there was a chance she would hand it directly to Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't think he was the guy who went rogue on the island. How much did you know about
        him?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know anything. Yagami just confessed on his own."
    </p>
    <p>"What kind of a trick was used for Komiya and the others to name Yagami? Was it a coincidence
        that the teacher showed up?"
    </p>
    <p>"I just told them that the person at the center of the trouble might be lured out. The Ryuen side,
    </p>
    <p>who couldn't identify the culprit, wanted a hint. I asked them to take me up on the suggestion,
    </p>
    <p>knowing the risk that no one would come to the student council. Or that even if they did, nothing
        would happen."
    </p>
    <p>"I see? Well, I wonder how much you're telling the truth."
    </p>
    <p>I left it to his imagination. What I did was really nothing but trivial. Nothing noteworthy.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, that’s fine. Now are you ready to fulfil your promise?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course. I'm looking forward to it, Student Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>As I approached the front door, I ended my call and reached for my ‘getabako’.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : A getabako (下駄箱) is a shoe cupboard in Japan, usually situated in the genkan, an
        entryway or porch of the house. Here it is the infamous shoe racks that you see in every school
        in anime. ]
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        Is Tsubaki alone at the meeting place?
    </p>
    <p>I thought so for a moment, but it seemed that Utomiya was talking to someone a little farther
        away. He was only looking at us.
    </p>
    <p>"Was there anything that was difficult to convey over the phone?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, the first-year students are in a bit of a mess right now. There was an unexpected
        expulsion at the Cultural festival."
    </p>
    <p>"Expulsion? That's a very disturbing story. Or should I say, ‘What's the point’ ?"
    </p>
    <p>A person who is involved in this school expulsion mess. That is Sakurako Tsubaki who is in
        front of me now.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm satisfied with the result, which exceeded my expectations …Ayanokoji-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>Tsubaki made a circle with her finger as if to say, "you passed."
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image13.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        "It seems you’ve successfully extracted information from Sato-senpai and drove Yagami-kun out
        of school. I am very grateful."
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't extract the information. You kept in touch with Sato and eventually cornered her. When
        she finally lost all patience, you coordinated your threats against her and forced her to confide in
        someone."
    </p>
    <p>Tsubaki, right here in front of me, was the person who approached Sato without my knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know what you mean. As if it was like that."
    </p>
    <p>Near the women's restroom at Keyaki Mall, Tsubaki presumably approached Sato. She piqued
        her interest by presenting some bait there that would change things for her, including a change
        in my relationship with Kei.
    </p>
    <p>"It appears that you did not make a real effort to force Sato into damaging our relationship when
        you called her to your room and made weak threats. It was because you wanted to subtly let her
        know that we were getting close in order to pressure her into action or prepare for the threat
        posed by Kei's relationship with me."
    </p>
    <p>Tsubaki, who listens silently, stares at me without denying it.
    </p>
    <p>"The strangeness of the situation became apparent as soon as I questioned her about the
        specifics. You called Sato again as if to follow up as soon as you saw she wasn't going to accept
        your offer, made similar remarks, and agitated her. You eventually intensified your threats and
        pursued Sato after realising that she didn't appear to have consulted anyone. She would
        eventually consult someone, and that person would be me, therefore this was necessary."
    </p>
    <p>The goal was not to trap Sato, but to wait for her to ask me for help.
    </p>
    <p>"Then, you most likely told Sato that it was Yagami who was behind the threats, not you."
    </p>
    <p>The mentally exhausted Sato probably didn't have time to think about whether that was true or
        not.
    </p>
    <p>I came up with the idea of using this one incident for personal use and decided to call up Kei
        during my discussion with Sato and had her confide in her about the abuse and almost
        everything that had led up to this point in her past.
    </p>
    <p>The fact that Sato didn’t choose Tsubaki's side afterwards convinced me that she would be on
        my side. As a result, the two of them elevated their relationship from friends to best friends in
        the truest sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>That was on November 1.
    </p>
    <p>"Yagami-kun is a bad guy, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>"You don't need cheap play. Yagami had nothing to do with this. He's not involved."
    </p>
    <p>"You don't think it was actually Yagami-kun's instructions?"
    </p>
    <p>"If Yagami had used Tsubaki to contact Sato, there was no need to bother naming him."
    </p>
    <p>The only people who know about Karuizawa's past are those who are connected with the White
        Room.
    </p>
    <p>Others can't easily imitate him in a way that wouldn’t have made it difficult for me to see through
        their disguise.
    </p>
    <p>"If that's the case, didn't you find that I was trying to frame Yagami-kun instead of the other way
        around? And yet, despite the fact that Yagami-kun, who might not be guilty, was expelled, you
        did nothing to me. That seems to be in conflict. There was no sign that Ayanokoji-senpai was
        thoroughly investigating it."
    </p>
    <p>"Ah. I didn't investigate Tsubaki or Yagami. No need for that."
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, but I don't feel like talking any more."
    </p>
    <p>I was certain that I had said enough. Even Tsubaki wasn't the one controlling everything. In
        addition, the person who painted this picture is the one who is hiding in the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>"Utomiya-kun, can you come here for a minute?"
    </p>
    <p>Utomiya was on the phone when Tsubaki gestured for him to hand over his phone to me.
    </p>
    <p>"By all means..."
    </p>
    <p>Wary, Utomiya handed me the phone while it was still connected.
    </p>
    <p>"Yagami had some of Tsubaki’s classmates expelled. That's why the two cooperated."
    </p>
    <p>It is definitely the voice of the man I spoke to last year on the phone and in front of my room.
    </p>
    <p>"You didn't approach him directly because you were confident you could defeat him at any
        moment. However, this led to expulsions from the first year. If not for his bother, it wouldn't have
        happened."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't deny it."
    </p>
    <p>"The only way to avoid further unnecessary sacrifices was to have him expelled. But even if you
        knew that, it isn’t easy to defeat Yagami. I know he is no ordinary high school student."
    </p>
    <p>"That's why you wanted to use me."
    </p>
    <p>He made this decision because he understood the white room student's purpose and obsession.
    </p>
    <p>"I guess you got my message,"
    </p>
    <p>"Eventually, you’ll get in touch with someone close to me. And when that happens, there will be
        expulsions, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. But to corner Yagami and expel him out all at once? That was a little outside of
        what was expected. Did you not consider the likelihood that Yagami was unrelated?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yagami had the option of choosing to be expelled or not. It wasn't me who made the distinction
        between black and white. He was occasionally putting himself in danger, exactly as when he
        expelled a first-year C Class student. He pretended to be Kushida Kikyo's former junior when he
        spoke with her, and he exploited the information he received to influence and manipulate her.
    </p>
    <p>Upon the uninhabited island, he injured some unconnected students severely to incite them. He
        also read the contents of a love letter intended for a different person because he believed it to
        be a trap. Horikita and Ibuki may have been present for other reasons that I am unsure of,
    </p>
    <p>including his toying with fire."
    </p>
    <p>Normally, you don't steal other people's love letters. And even if you did, you wouldn't notice the
        anagrams that were sprinkled throughout.
    </p>
    <p>"So it was all connected."
    </p>
    <p>"Even if there was no clear evidence left behind, the more tricks you play, the more traces you
        will always leave behind. That guy didn't realize he was strangling himself with silk cord."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here the Kanji used ‘真綿’ means - to drag things out; to creep up slowly on the
        point; (Here) to strangle (execute) slowly with a silk cord (instead of quickly with a rope) ]
    </p>
    <p>"Certainly, if Yagami hadn't done anything, he wouldn't have been expelled at this stage."
    </p>
    <p>"I agree."
    </p>
    <p>Playing with fire repeatedly had resulted in this situation.
    </p>
    <p>I wouldn't have bothered Yagami if he hadn't offended the man on the phone, and he wouldn't
        have been expelled if he hadn't gotten in touch with Kushida or gravely hurt those guys on the
        uninhabited island.
    </p>
    <p>He wouldn't have been in a position to be interrogated if he hadn't seen what was in the love
        letter.
    </p>
    <p>"The only reason he was expelled was because Yagami indirectly admitted to himself being in
        the wrong."
    </p>
    <p>I only prepared the groundwork for a test. There wouldn't have been a fuss if he had been
        entirely right in the first place. He just went to the student council room because he was smart
        enough and knew me.
    </p>
    <p>"You seem to be as good as the rumors say you are."
    </p>
    <p>"By the way, just to confirm, remember what you told me before? You told me that you don't
        think that even if I get rid of the intruders, it will bring back peace.That was a bluff, wasn't it? You
        wanted to create a sense of urgency that if I didn't take care of the problem soon, it would
        become even more difficult."
    </p>
    <p>In order to make me move, he had made a move to get Yagami expelled from the school from
        that stage.
    </p>
    <p>"As Ayanokoji-sensei said, choosing this school was the right choice."
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>"Exactly as stated, I'm going to enjoy my school life, and as long as we don't have any conflict
        with each other during the first and second year, I'll let our relationship end here."
    </p>
    <p>After saying what he wanted to say, the call was instantly ended. A quick glance at the cell
        phone screen showed that the call had been purposefully blocked.
    </p>
    <p>Utomiya has registered the email address, and it is an action to prevent someone from seeing
        the phone number or the address of the other person.
    </p>
    <p>"Have you figured it out?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah."
    </p>
    <p>"I initially believed Hosen-kun was responsible for my classmate's expulsion from school, but I
        recently discovered out it was Yagami-kun."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami's potential may be impeccably high, but he’d been caught flatfooted by his own conceit.
    </p>
    <p>He was only concerned about me and didn’t see his rivals standing on the same stage.
    </p>
    <p>It seemed that Yagami was not a welcome presence in the first-year students' battle.
    </p>
    <p>"Don't quit just because you've defeated your enemy, Tsubaki."
    </p>
    <p>"I know. To be honest, I wasn't attached to this school at first, but that's changed a bit. This
        school is surprisingly fun."
    </p>
    <p>Looking at the exchange just now, it was clear that there were a lot of mixed feelings other than
        simply taking revenge on an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>"So, we're leaving." (said by utomiya)
    </p>
    <p>"...... Excuse my rudeness." (also said by utomiya)
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here in the 2nd sentence Utomiya said - ‘Shitsureishimasu’ - 失礼します - A good
        English translation of 失礼します would be “Excuse me” or more literally, “Excuse my rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>Here This is of course in the present tense; so you say this before you perform the impolite
        action. Impolite action here being leaving before (people generally say this in offices while
        leaving before their seniors or other co-workers). Without diving deep much, in short
        Shitsureishimasu is a polite expression to use when you are leaving. ]
    </p>
    <p>Utomiya, who was forcing himself to be polite using Keigo, returned to the dormitory with
        Tsubaki.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Keigo (敬語; respectful language) is the polite or formal way of Japanese speech.
    </p>
    <p>This can be used when talking to people that are of higher social status or someone with power.
    </p>
    <p>‘Shitsureishimasu’ is considered in keigo. ]
    </p>
    <p>"I have to get back to class too.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        After finishing the conversation with Tsubaki, on the way back to the classroom, I encountered
        an exhausted Chabashira-sensei.
    </p>
    <p>"Thanks for your hard work today. You did a great job."
    </p>
    <p>"What’s with the compliment?"
    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei was clearly angry as she turned her childlike glare on me without hiding it.
    </p>
    <p>"Did you really hate it so much that we made you wear a maid's uniform?"
    </p>
    <p>I asked knowingly, and she shook her head and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>"My photos were all over the teacher desks when I returned to the staff room. Not only that. In
        the brief time I've been there, I wonder how many teachers have approached me, how many
        comments about my maid's uniform have been made, and how many embarrassing moments
        I've had. I truly want to be a shellfish right now."
    </p>
    <p>It must have been a really hard time for her, because she felt the pressure so intensely.
    </p>
    <p>"That's…… not for me to know. It must be symbolic of your popularity."
    </p>
    <p>"In no way am I a popular person. You went far beyond."
    </p>
    <p>You were going to struggle in the future if you truly believed there was no such thing as
        popularity. Even though they hadn't come forward until recently, there must have been many
        adults who respected Chabashira-sensei as a person of the other sex.
    </p>
    <p>"That's it. The class won first place, so isn’t it good?"
    </p>
    <p>"It’s not good at all. If anything, the top sales amount was a sure thing even if I didn't do
        anything."
    </p>
    <p>"I see. Well, first place looks better than second and third place, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>"That's not like you to say that… at all."
    </p>
    <p>She took a deep breath and resisted saying anything, as if she felt there was no use in blaming
        me any longer.
    </p>
    <p>"Even so, I didn't think you were cooperating with Ryuen’s class under the guise of being hostile
        to them."
    </p>
    <p>"If one class fights alone, the maximum strength is about 40 people. But if two classes join
        hands you will have a nearly twice that number of people will join hands. But this is not a
        foolproof system.."
    </p>
    <p>On the surface, advertising doesn't have to be related to one another. You can put on a big
        spectacle without spending a lot of money if you gather plenty of people, albeit in various forms.
    </p>
    <p>"Even the staff room was surprised. Everyone thought it was a real showdown."
    </p>
    <p>Chabashira-sensei only mentioned the festival's success, but not Yagami's expulsion.
    </p>
    <p>Teachers and even first-year students who weren't directly involved in the event ought to be
        aware of it, but none have brought up the topic with me, who they see to be uninvolved. She
        was doing the right thing as a teacher at this school.
    </p>
    <p>"By the way, aren't you going back?"
    </p>
    <p>"I have Horikita waiting in the classroom. Are you still working overtime?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm moving about the campus. There have been numerous reports of guests leaving things
        behind."
    </p>
    <p>The teachers were therefore still busy cleaning up after the festival even after it had ended.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        Horikita was lying on her desk with her upper body on top when Chabashira-sensei and I
        entered the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>We both exchanged glances before deciding not to speak to heri. She appeared to be asleep as
        I moved in closer to check. The window was open, letting in a strong breeze.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image14.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        For a moment, I wondered if I should put a uniform jacket on her, but I decided against it. I
        decided not to do that because I knew that Horikita would not be pleased if she knew that I had
        approached her later.
    </p>
    <p>"hm……"
    </p>
    <p>Hmm? For a moment I thought she was awake, but apparently not.
    </p>
    <p>"No good…"
    </p>
    <p>She was speaking while she slept. It was a bit of a remarkable statement, so I was a little
        surprised.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita must have been tired today. I closed only the window quietly so that she wouldn't catch
        a cold at least. I went back to the corridor with my feet straight.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to let her sleep a little longer."
    </p>
    <p>"Are you waiting for her to wake up?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, we did manage to get first place at the school festival. She deserves this much."
    </p>
    <p>She’ll be up soon anyway.
    </p>
    <p>"You can leave. I'll take over here."
    </p>
    <p>"Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>"As the man behind the scenes, you also deserve that much."
    </p>
    <p>"Then I'll accept your offer."
    </p>
    <p>"But Ayanokoji, don't ever think of a plan to humiliate me again, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"Do you still care?"
    </p>
    <p>"...For me, it's a day I'll never forget for the rest of my life."
    </p>
    <p>"Well, Chabashira-sensei, thank you for your hard work. Someday that will be a good memory
        too."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't get cheeky, student."
    </p>
    <p>Glaring at me, Chabashira-sensei sighed and leaned against the classroom door.
    </p>
    <p>Well then, Shall I go home?

    <h3>Afterword</h3>
<p>
The year 2022, We find ourselves approaching the halfway point of the year. It's too soon,
</p><p>Kinugasa here.
</p><p>Eating ginger has recently become my boom, and I regularly buy a few kilos of ginger, grate it,
</p><p>buy a few kilos of ginger, grate it, and repeat the process, eating it with meat and vegetables.
</p><p>I especially like the combination of eringi mushrooms, ginger, and lemon sauce the best.
</p><p>Hehehe, I've revealed a bit of my private life that no one is interested in.
</p><p>Yes. I didn't have anything to write about, so I was a little confused, but let's get down to the
main topic.
</p><p>This story is mainly about the cultural festival in November.
</p><p>I know some of you may have wanted to see the costumes of the other students, but please
understand that this is a story for another time.
</p><p>The story is progressing smoothly without stopping.
</p><p>Soon the second semester will end, and we will enter the winter break and the turbulent third
semester.
</p><p>Although the number of volumes is a little larger than originally expected, the second grade
version has finally passed the halfway point. I feel that we are getting closer and closer to the
conclusion of the story.
</p><p>Will Ayanokoji be able to graduate from school safely?
</p><p>How will each class ultimately end up?
</p><p>I think we will be able to see the whole picture little by little, so please wait patiently.
</p><p>And then! Finally, the second season of the anime will start in July!
</p><p>We have been waiting for it for a long time.
</p><p>I waited so long that I was wondering how long I had to wait.
</p><p>I can't wait to see Ayanokoji and his friends in action for the first time in several years.
</p><p>There is also a 3rd season planned, so yeah, how can I put it... I'm overwhelmed with emotion.
</p><p>People who like You-Zitsu, people who don't like it, people who are interested and people who
aren't, I hope everyone will watch it.it
I will watch it as one of those who have been waiting for the second season more than anyone
else. Yay!
</p><p>Finally, I would like to make an unusually serious announcement. Please understand this in
advance.
</p><p>"Classroom of the Elite 2nd season" will start soon, but I wrote "Classroom of the Elite Volume
0" as a BD&DVD bonus. It was really hard. Since it's Volume 0, it's about Ayanokoji's past.
</p><p>Thanks to the full cooperation of illustrator Tomose-sensei, we have achieved the same volume
and number of illustrations as the main story.
</p><p>That is all for now, and I will leave you with this afterword.
</p><p>Well, everyone, I will see you again somewhere within the year.
</p><p></p>
