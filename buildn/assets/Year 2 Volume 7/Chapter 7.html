    <h2>A Surprising Appearance</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        After 3:00 PM, my work in the Cultural Festival was about to be over.
    </p>
    <p>After the ace up his sleeve was activated, I left things to Ayanokoji-kun and left the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>"Still, to think that he would make Chabashira Sensei into a maid..."
    </p>
    <p>In this Cultural Festival, I made the advanced arrangements together with Ayanokoji-kun.
    </p>
    <p>I heard that Chabashira Sensei would be utilized in the last hour, but, I wasn't sure if it would
        happen for real.
    </p>
    <p>But, after it was done, great results were about to be had.
    </p>
    <p>I knew that when I walked through the corridor and heard the rumours about Chabashira
        Sensei.
    </p>
    <p>Anyhow, Chabashira Sensei's participation in this war is an advantageous event for me
        personally too.
    </p>
    <p>With a lot of attention gathering on the Special Building, people quickly started disappearing
        from the other places.
    </p>
    <p>I sent that person a message with my phone, confirmed that it was read, and decided to head
        for the student council room.
    </p>
    <p>The reason is that, once again, I wanted to confirm the record of proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, I can ask for help from Yagami-kun on the day the student council will gather, but if I
        did that, I can't calmly observe things.
    </p>
    <p>A person who would hint at Ayanokoji-kun’s expulsion.
    </p>
    <p>They seem connected with Amasawa-san, so, he is a dangerous person with a lot of ability.
    </p>
    <p>Further, if it was Yagami-kun, if I asked him to show me the record of proceedings again, he will
        notice my suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>No... If I am to assume that he is the culprit, I should assume that he already thinks that way.
    </p>
    <p>In any case, in order to be sure that I wouldn’t be found out, it was necessary to aim for a time
        period when no one was around.
    </p>
    <p>Because of Student Council Head Nagumo's circumstances, the Student Council has been
        closed for a while.
    </p>
    <p>In summary, I am limited on chances to sneak a peek into the record of proceedings, but,
    </p>
    <p>reversely, this also means that the people have already cleared out for me.
    </p>
    <p>I saw my chance at the time of this Cultural Festival.
    </p>
    <p>I told Chabashira Sensei that I might have forgotten my notebook in the Student Council Room,
    </p>
    <p>and gained the possibility to go get it after receiving the key in the staff room at break time.
    </p>
    <p>Even if I am spotted stepping into the Student Council room, I now have a just cause.
    </p>
    <p>I quickly changed out of my maid outfit, and headed alone for the staff room.
    </p>
    <p>"50 more minutes, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>I walked until nearby the Student Council Room, looked at the corridor clock that was set up,
    </p>
    <p>and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>Before anything, today was a busy day.
    </p>
    <p>It hasn't ended yet, but, my duty is over.
    </p>
    <p>As I have to take a break for an hour, the Cultural Festival will end at the same time as my break
        ends.
    </p>
    <p>Wearing a maid outfit since the morning, working without a break, it was very busy.
    </p>
    <p>When I reached the Student Council Room after changing clothes, I silently put the key into the
        entrance.
    </p>
    <p>Today was a busy day in the Cultural Festival, and there was no one around in the Student
        Council room.
    </p>
    <p>In summary, it's no difficult task now to take a look at the record of proceedings, and take a
        photo of it with my phone.
    </p>
    <p>That is what I thought, but...
    </p>
    <p>My phone shook in my pocket, and there was a call. Looking at the name, my heart skipped a
        beat.
    </p>
    <p>Yagami Takuya.
    </p>
    <p>Why am I receiving a phone call from him at a time like this?
    </p>
    <p>Feeling afraid of this coincidence, I answered.
    </p>
    <p>"Hello?"
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita Senpai."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami's voice, which should be coming from over the phone, could be heard directly from
        nearby.
    </p>
    <p>The person that I least want to see right now was waving at me while smiling.
    </p>
    <p>As if freezing water had been directly poured into my heart, I felt a terrible cold in my entire
        body.
    </p>
    <p>"Did I surprise you?"
    </p>
    <p>After saying so, he turned off the phone, and started getting closer and closer to me.
    </p>
    <p>"Yagami-kun, why are you here?"
    </p>
    <p>"Why... What do you mean? Did you not like that I called you on the phone from nearby?"
    </p>
    <p>With my attention being focused on other things, I forgot to point that out.
    </p>
    <p>It was as if Yagami-kun was trying to figure out what I was so anxious about.
    </p>
    <p>"By the way, Senpai, why are you in a deserted place like this? With the Cultural Festival
        coming to an end, don't you have some last things to take care of?"
    </p>
    <p>"My work in the Cultural Festival is over since I've entered my break. With that, I wanted to be
        alone just for a little bit, so."
    </p>
    <p>"So you're on a break from 3 PM? You chose quite the rare pattern of behaviour, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>Rare, is it?
    </p>
    <p>I've never experienced a Cultural Festival like this, so I can't make a judgement on that.
    </p>
    <p>However, as there is a rule which states all participants must take a break for an hour, there
        must be other students that chose to take their breaks at 3 PM.
    </p>
    <p>I wasn't able to think up a reply right way, and ended up staying silent for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>The fact that there is no truth or lie to the words "rare pattern of behaviour" said by Yagami-kun.
    </p>
    <p>That it was simply said to question whether I chose 3 PM without any reason, or if I chose this
        time with some plans in mind.
    </p>
    <p>In reality, I was at a loss for words and could not reply right away.
    </p>
    <p>No matter how I reply next, it might already be too late.
    </p>
    <p>No, it's not over yet.
    </p>
    <p>Even if I am late on my reply, I can still make a thorough choice.
    </p>
    <p>"Rare pattern of behaviour". I have to ignore these strange words.
    </p>
    <p>"Why are you here, Yagami-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>"I saw you with a rare expression on your face, so, I was curious and came after you."
    </p>
    <p>"Since when? No matter the reason, it's not admirable to follow after a girl."
    </p>
    <p>"I called out to you, but, you didn't hear me in the hustle and bustle."
    </p>
    <p>While coming here, I really was deep in my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>But, would I really not have heard someone calling out to me? It doesn't feel like he's trying to
        shake me like before, but, there might be another meaning to this line of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>Besides, he could have called out to me many times in the time that I was coming here.
    </p>
    <p>Could it be that he didn't chase after me, but was here from the start..?
    </p>
    <p>This is all under the assumption that Yagami-kun is the skilled penman that I have been
        chasing.
    </p>
    <p>I am so suspicious of him that I'd have to apologize later if he has nothing to do with this.
    </p>
    <p>"Is it really okay for you to slip out of the Cultural Festival?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm the same too. I've done what I need to and finished my duties. It's not my break time, but,
    </p>
    <p>I've received some free time. There's no rule that says you can't take a break for more than an
        hour, so."
    </p>
    <p>So this is a simple coincidence after all?
    </p>
    <p>No, it would be better if I don't think like that.
    </p>
    <p>If I realize that it's a coincidence after, that won't cause any problems.
    </p>
    <p>But, if it wasn't a coincidence, then I'd be in trouble right now.
    </p>
    <p>"Do you have something to do in the Student Council Room? It's locked, so I don't think there's
        anyone in there."
    </p>
    <p>As if anticipating what I was going to do, Yagami-kun looked at the room's door and said so.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm just searching for something. I got the key from the staff room, so it's okay."
    </p>
    <p>"Searching for something, huh? I will help you with your search, then."
    </p>
    <p>In my heart, calmnness and impatience started to conflict and fight with each other.
    </p>
    <p>I can't clearly judge if he said these words with good or bad intent.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not so much that I need help from you."
    </p>
    <p>"You're going to the trouble of searching around right in the middle of the Cultural Festival, it's
        something important, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>He spoke as if my thoughts were laid bare to him, and he could see right through me.
    </p>
    <p>"It's a notebook. I just bought it, but I couldn't find it so I was worried. When I think that someone
        else might have picked it up and read it, it's not good for my mental health. I was about to give
        up, but it's always on my mind, and the student council room is the only place left that I haven't
        searched."
    </p>
    <p>There's no reason to spend more time on this.
    </p>
    <p>I'll just tell the same lie to Yagami that I told to the teachers.
    </p>
    <p>"Then I'll help you with the search too. It's gonna get loud and crowded again when the Cultural
        Festival is over, so. Two people searching is simply more efficient than one person, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"I... I guess that's true."
    </p>
    <p>I slowly turned the key, and the door opened. As I was about to leave Yagami-kun standing next
        to me and take a step forward, I stopped moving.
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita Senpai? Is it really necessary to have two people in order to find something in the
        student council room? Or do you have some other aim?"
    </p>
    <p>"Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>Considering my situation, I decided to go on the offensive.
    </p>
    <p>"The reason I tried to deny your aid, was that honestly, I felt a little scared."
    </p>
    <p>"You mean... Scared of me?"
    </p>
    <p>"You don't get it?"
    </p>
    <p>"I can't think of anything."
    </p>
    <p>"The deserted student council room. You say that you called out to me, but I never heard you. It
        seems like you followed me, and now we're alone here. Do you know how that feels as a
        woman?"
    </p>
    <p>Here, I challenge him not personally as Horikita Suzune, but with the viewpoint of societal
        differences between the genders.
    </p>
    <p>It doesn't matter if his intent is good or bad, I'll absolutely drive him away.
    </p>
    <p>"Ah, I see. Sorry, I didn't think about that at all... I see..."
    </p>
    <p>With this, it would be way too thoughtless for him to enter the student council room, and, further,
    </p>
    <p>he also can't wait in the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>It's only natural that it would seem creepy if he did such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>"I apologize. I realize now that my actions were wrong."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, deeply bowing his head.
    </p>
    <p>"However, though I know how rude it would be, may I just say something?"
    </p>
    <p>"What would that be?"
    </p>
    <p>As he said so without raising his head back up, I wondered what he had to say now after
        reaching this point.
    </p>
    <p>"The true reason that you came to the student council room is..."
    </p>
    <p>The moment he said so and raised his head...
    </p>
    <p>He suddenly lost his balance in front of my eyes and bent his upper body.
    </p>
    <p>No, it was bent by someone else.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image12.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        "Caught you!"
    </p>
    <p>Along with such a voice, it was Ibuki's figure that appeared, in her japanese outfit.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, come on, Ibuki-san!?"
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita, stop idling and get in! It'll be a big trouble if we are seen, so!"
    </p>
    <p>It's true, this clearly seems like a violent act, so it's a big problem if we are found.
    </p>
    <p>As I opened the student council room's door, Ibuki-san forcefully pushed Yagami-kun and
        entered inside.
    </p>
    <p>"What... What are you doing..?"
    </p>
    <p>The first one to raise his voice, was of course Yagami-kun, the victim.
    </p>
    <p>Ibuki-san, having restrained Yagami-kun after appearing from behind him, was confused about
        the Situation.
    </p>
    <p>"You were saved by my efforts again, huh, Horikita!"
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean saved..? Nothing was being done to me..."
    </p>
    <p>"You're the one that told me to be careful about this guy, right? So, with you being hounded by
        him... It's only natural that I thought something might happen, right?"
    </p>
    <p>She chattily said all the things that she shouldn't have said out loud.
    </p>
    <p>With her simple-minded actions, my entire conversation up until now has gone to waste.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here the word is used 単細胞 - Tansaibou - Single Cell. Word used to mean
        "simple-minded" as a colloquialism. ]
    </p>
    <p>Saying out loud that I was on guard against him right in front of the person in question... This is
        way too non-sensical.
    </p>
    <p>"Umm, why did you tell her she should be careful with me?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, unable to move, naturally threw such a question at me.
    </p>
    <p>Now that it's become like this, I have to tell him everything.
    </p>
    <p>"...Sorry about getting rough. But, there are some things about you that I'm curious about.
    </p>
    <p>Earlier, do you remember when I had you show me the record of proceedings?"
    </p>
    <p>"It was about the comment Student Council President Nagumo made, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. I wanted to see again the letters you wrote that you showed me."
    </p>
    <p>"Letters? I don't really get it, but what you were really searching for is the notebook of the record
        of proceedings, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun continued with bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>"About you wanting to see what I wrote, what is the intent behind it?"
    </p>
    <p>I'm curious about what he was about to say before Ibuki-san showed up, but, I'll continue my
        explanation.
    </p>
    <p>Back when we had the Uninhabited Island Special Exam, a piece of paper was put into my tent.
    </p>
    <p>I'll told him I'm trying to find out who its sender was.
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun is silently listening, still restrained.
    </p>
    <p>"So, you're saying that the letters I wrote in the record of proceedings look like the letters in that
        paper?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, that's right."
    </p>
    <p>"If you're telling the truth, I can certainly understand why you're on guard against me. So, I
        suppose that this was the best time to confirm this in secret."
    </p>
    <p>Because of the preparation period for the Cultural Festival, people were coming and going on
        Saturdays too, and students were walking around the school looking for a place to set up their
        stalls, so I couldn't collect it then.
    </p>
    <p>"However, I am not the sender of that letter."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, firmly denying. I do want to believe him, but...
    </p>
    <p>As I wasn't simply accepting this, his voice's tone started to strain a little.
    </p>
    <p>"Do you have a basis to suspect me?"
    </p>
    <p>"Unfortunately, I don't. It's just that, I can't just accept what you're saying so easily."
    </p>
    <p>"If it's okay, can I have you show me the paper? I think we can compare the letters with the
        record of proceedings too after that, so we can make clear the truth."
    </p>
    <p>"Unfortunately, that's not possible. I lost it because of some trouble."
    </p>
    <p>It was crumpled and thrown away by Amasawa whom I had to confront on the island.
    </p>
    <p>"Well, that's no good. How can I make things clear, then?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's why I want to take a second look at the record of proceedings."
    </p>
    <p>"Even if you did take a second look, your memory can't be perfect, can it? Actually, right now,
    </p>
    <p>you're very suspicious of me. With that, the possibility that the memories inside your head will
        change and I will become the culprit isn't low at all. In this situation, I am clearly in the
        disadvantage."
    </p>
    <p>"...That may be true, yes."
    </p>
    <p>It's not like I want it to be Yagami-kun, but, I strongly want to find the culprit.
    </p>
    <p>I do understand why he is worried about the developments that may take place now.
    </p>
    <p>"It is regrettable that I am being suspected, but, can I at least have you let go of my hand for
        now? In any case, this isn't good for you two either, right? How do you intend to explain this if
        Student Council President Nagumo sees us like this?"
    </p>
    <p>Restraining a boy from Year One without any reason.
    </p>
    <p>It's true, for us, this situation is the very embodiment of inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>It would be different if he acted violently, but he isn't doing anything.
    </p>
    <p>"Ibuki-san, let his hand go."
    </p>
    <p>I instructed Ibuki-san to follow his words.
    </p>
    <p>However, Ibuki-san's expression is stiff as she was restraining Yagami-kun, and she didn't move
        a muscle.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, but I can't do that."
    </p>
    <p>"Why is that?"
    </p>
    <p>"Because my instincts are telling me that people who seem harmless and insignificant like you
        can be very dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here - 人畜無害 - Jinchikumugai - Harmless to humans and animals. Yojijukugo (four
        character compound). Colloquially used to mean insignificant, unimportant, etc. ]
    </p>
    <p>That's something she learned earlier from Ayanokoji-kun.
    </p>
    <p>However, looking at her manners, it was clear that her problem with him wasn't just because of
        the way he looks.
    </p>
    <p>"Is there some other reason?"
    </p>
    <p>"Even though you look lanky and weak at a glance, I can sense something dangerous
        emanating from you. You're not just a simple nerd, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here Ibuki uses the word - がり勉 - Gariben - Person who is obsessed with studying,
    </p>
    <p>paraphrased as "nerd". ]
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it's a feeling that she can get from directly being in contact with him that I can't from just
        looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>The possibility is high that the person we are looking for has the appropriate mastery.
    </p>
    <p>There is no helping the fact that I would be very suspicious about the possibility that this may
        really be Yagami-kun.
    </p>
    <p>"The message that I was handed very much looks like it was written by you. Adding onto that,
    </p>
    <p>your hidden physical strength. Then, the fact that you showed up in this place."
    </p>
    <p>"It's true that I like strengthening my body, so I am somehow confident on that matter, but..."
    </p>
    <p>While sighing as if tired of all this, Yagami-kun slightly turned his eyes towards me.
    </p>
    <p>"Even I'm getting a bit angry after all, you know? This situation is just way too one-sided."
    </p>
    <p>Even though Yagami-kun possesses high physical strength, like Ibuki-san claims, there's
        nothing strange about it. In the first place, his OAA grades are average at C. Though his running
        speed is low and he isn't skillful at sports, one could still think that he can have a good
        understanding of Budou (Martial Arts).
    </p>
    <p>Is it Black or White? Which way is it?
    </p>
    <p>As the judgement was drawing near, the silence was broken in an unexpected manner.
    </p>
    <p>Though no one should be there, the student council room's door opened by itself.
    </p>
    <p>"Oops, this is a strange situation, huh..."
    </p>
    <p>The one who showed himself is Student Council President Nagumo. Yagami-kun is the only one
        that didn't change his attitude, but, as me and Ibuki-san were feeling uneasy after our actions,
    </p>
    <p>we were very surprised.
    </p>
    <p>"Student Council President, why are you here..."
    </p>
    <p>"More importantly, what's happening here?"
    </p>
    <p>What he means is the fact that Ibuki-san is restraining Yagami-kun.
    </p>
    <p>"If you two are bullying your Kouhai(Junior Student), that's a big problem."
    </p>
    <p>Of course, Ibuki-san couldn't continue restraining him, so she let both her hands go and
        released Yagami-kun.
    </p>
    <p>"Thank you, Student Council President Nagumo."
    </p>
    <p>Appearing to have calmed down,
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun soothed his body after it had been restrained.
    </p>
    <p>What's with his calm demeanor? It's as if he foresaw that the Student Council President would
        come here.
    </p>
    <p>"Then, shall I have you explain the reason you're here without permission?"
    </p>
    <p>"I lost my notebook". If I answer so, Yagami-kun may point out my lie.
    </p>
    <p>However, if I tell him my story about the record of proceedings, then he will have to be included
        in the conversation too.
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita Senpai lost her notebook, so I thought that I should help in her search. Apparently,
    </p>
    <p>Ibuki Senpai mistakenly thought that I was assaulting Horikita Senpai, and, did what she did a
        while ago out of a sense of justice."
    </p>
    <p>Without doing anything that would put me in a bad position, he answered so, in order to protect
        my lie.
    </p>
    <p>"I see, so that is the reason for your restraint."
    </p>
    <p>"I think the misunderstanding has been solved, so, I don't really intend to make a big issue of it."
    </p>
    <p>"There's no reason to extend this conversation any longer, then. So, did you find that
        notebook?"
    </p>
    <p>If he's keeping up with my excuses, then I will do the same and follow along.
    </p>
    <p>"No, I couldn't find it. This was my last hope, but... I think it might have been thrown out as trash.
    </p>
    <p>I'll give up on it."
    </p>
    <p>He's checked it himself, so the notebook's whereabouts aren't important to him.
    </p>
    <p>He meaninglessly averted his eyes from me, and returned to his usual seat.
    </p>
    <p>"No matter the reason, this isn't something to do in the middle of the Cultural Festival. Disperse
        right now."
    </p>
    <p>Even if I insist, I can't see the record of proceedings anymore. All I can do now is obediently
        withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>With this in my mind, Ibuki-san and I were about to leave the room, but...
    </p>
    <p>"Still, Student Council President Nagumo, how did you know that we were here?"
    </p>
    <p>Standing next to me and Ibuki-san, Yagami-kun threw such a question at him.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you bothered by something?"
    </p>
    <p>"I thought that the student council room was supposed to be locked. Yet, you seemed to have so
        easily entered the room, so I'm a bit curious."
    </p>
    <p>That really was strange.
    </p>
    <p>I don't know if he has a spare key or not, but, he should have at least put the key in first to open
        the door.
    </p>
    <p>Thus, it's not unreasonable to feel suspicion about him entering the room like that without any
        suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>It's almost as if he knew who was in here from the start...
    </p>
    <p>Did Student Council President Nagumo and Yagami-kun intend to meet up here?
    </p>
    <p>In that case, I'll better understand Yagami-kun's prediction that the Student Council Head would
        come here.
    </p>
    <p>But, the two's give and take is far from looking like it was planned beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>"I can answer, but there's something I want to ask Yagami before."
    </p>
    <p>"Me?"
    </p>
    <p>"Before this, do you remember the matter we talked about in the Student Council Room? About
        the rumours that I was using large amounts of money to have students expelled."
    </p>
    <p>"Of course. I've been investigating from my side too, but I still can't grasp where the rumours
        were coming from."
    </p>
    <p>I can't follow along with this subject that they've dragged up.
    </p>
    <p>"You actually know, don't you? Where the rumours came from."
    </p>
    <p>"...What are you saying?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm saying that you're the one who spread those rumours."
    </p>
    <p>Student Council President Nagumo lost his patience and lightly kicked the lower part of the
        table.
    </p>
    <p>"Please wait. What is this all of a sudden? Why would I do something like that?"
    </p>
    <p>After being suspected by us, now, he's being suspected by Student Council President Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>Further, it's about a completely different matter.
    </p>
    <p>"The fuck do you mean why? The special exam that had prize money bet on it, which was done
        to expel specific students. You were one of the many people who participated, right?"
    </p>
    <p>With that, Yagami-kun's expression slightly grew gloomy. He too was irritated, like Student
        Council President Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>"Student Council President Nagumo, what is the meaning of this? Just what are you talking
        about?"
    </p>
    <p>"You denied it at the student council meeting, but I'm saying that this was the truth."
    </p>
    <p>"Then, did you really..?"
    </p>
    <p>"But, it's not like the rules were broken or anything, you know? It's only the school's policy. As
        the Student Council President, Board Chairman Tsukishiro and I came together to keep
        everything impartial. Isn't that right? Yagami."
    </p>
    <p>There has always been merciless special exams occurring in this school, but to think that it was
        this much...
    </p>
    <p>"Not me. There's no reason for me to put you in trouble, Student Council President Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>Besides, there are many other Year One students who received the same explanation, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Who knows. However, you showed up here, right? That makes me want to be suspicious."
    </p>
    <p>"That's just a coincidence."
    </p>
    <p>Student Council President Nagumo and Yagami-kun faced each other, but, he moved his gaze
        to us.
    </p>
    <p>"You should go back. I'll talk to Yagami now."
    </p>
    <p>"I did not know about that matter, but please allow me to speak."
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita Senpai. What do you intend to say?"
    </p>
    <p>He’s looking with Such piercing eyes. He covered for me earlier, but I’m going to have to ignore
        that fact.
    </p>
    <p>"Say it, then."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know if he is the one that spread the rumours of that special exam. However, I don't
        think that it's a coincidence that he showed up here. Yagami-kun was following behind me. I
        strongly feel that he could actually have been standing guard around this student council room
        from the start."
    </p>
    <p>"You hear what Suzune said?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun's expression stiffened as he was being pressed from both sides, but then, he let out
        a tired sigh.
    </p>
    <p>"...I see, I understand everything now. You two were together from the start, yes? Back when
        you handed me that fake love letter, you had already decided to forcefully corner me here,
    </p>
    <p>right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Fake... Love letter?"
    </p>
    <p>"You mean this?"
    </p>
    <p>What Student Council President Nagumo took out of his pocket was, the love letter that I
        received from Ichihashi-san.
    </p>
    <p>No, but, what does "fake love letter" mean?
    </p>
    <p>"I don't get it. It's just a simple love letter from an unknown sender with someone's feelings for
        me written on it."
    </p>
    <p>"You're wrong. At a glance, that letter really is a love letter, but, the words "Cultural Festival 3
        P.M. Student Council Room" are written on it. Other than that, I've also spotted the words
        "Necessary", "Expulsion", and "Secret" in a few places. Am I mistaken?"
    </p>
    <p>Opening the letter that already had its seal broken, Student Council Head Nagumo looked it
        over.
    </p>
    <p>"Where's all of that stuff written? I can't see anything."
    </p>
    <p>As such, Student Council President Nagumo made the move to hand me the love let-.. The
        letter.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : In the original Japanese text it says - 'As such, Student Council President Nagumo
        made the move to hand me the love letter... Letter.' At first it's written in Katakana as the english
        word, then the word letter is written again as the japanese word for it. The meaning here is that
        it's not actually a "love letter" as it is a fake, so she hesitates and says "letter" instead the
        second time. That's the reason I decided to Paraphrase it that way to imply that. ]
    </p>
    <p>"Excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>I took the letter and looked over the contents. However, I can't find the words mentioned by
        Yagami-kun anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>Ibuki-san also curiously peeked at it, and had the same reaction as us.
    </p>
    <p>"I hope you can forgive me for confessing without mentioning my name, I've always loved
        you...". The contents were such.
    </p>
    <p>"Please stop this monkey show. If you solve the anagram, the truth will be clear."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : 猿芝居 - Sarushibai - Monkey show, monkey acting... Idiom used to express
        someone acting in a foolish or unconvincing way. ]
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean anagram..?"
    </p>
    <p>Putting aside Ibuki-san who doesn't even understand the word's meaning, is he saying that the
        letter written includes anagrams? Changing the order of the letters and changing the meaning.
    </p>
    <p>Word-play.
    </p>
    <p>No matter how many times I repeatedly try to find them, the answer won't come out.
    </p>
    <p>I might be able to find them if I take some time, but, it's not possible in just a single moment.
    </p>
    <p>"You're really smart, huh, Yagami-kun. Looks like both me and Suzune can't solve the anagrams
        that quickly, though?"
    </p>
    <p>As we deepen our suspicion towards him, Yagami-kun is strongly on guard against us.
    </p>
    <p>"Could it be that one of you two wrote it? Perhaps some common acquaintance of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>"A common acquaintance? Just who would that be?"
    </p>
    <p>"...No, I don't know, but... Please believe that I just reached this place thanks to those
        anagrams."
    </p>
    <p>"The anagrams don't matter right now. Why do you already know this love letter's contents? This
        means that you read it before handing it to me, right?"
    </p>
    <p>That's right. There's no other way.
    </p>
    <p>"That, is just a coincidence. When the letter was dropped, the seal slipped off and the contents
        were out. I did think that I shouldn't look, but, I couldn't help but take a glance."
    </p>
    <p>"As a member of the student council, that's a very unethical action."
    </p>
    <p>It's not like I don't get why he would want to sneak a peek, but, normally, one should restrain
        themselves from such action.
    </p>
    <p>Especially considering that the letter has nothing to do with him. Why would he take the risk to
        check the contents?
    </p>
    <p>The fact that the sender is unclear certainly raises one's curiosity, but, it's a different matter to
        look inside just because of such a reason.
    </p>
    <p>"You checked inside because you're regularly conducting evil plots, right? You were worried that
        you had fallen into some kind of trap."
    </p>
    <p>"It doesn't really feel like you'll believe me even if I say that you're wrong."
    </p>
    <p>This entire conversation strangely feels creepy.
    </p>
    <p>The world as I see it, as Yagami-kun sees it, and as Student Council President Nagumo sees it.
    </p>
    <p>It didn't even feel in the least like we saw things differently.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : 三者三様 - Sanshasanyou - Three People, Three Appearances - Yojijukugo (four
        character compound), meaning each of the three has their own way of seeing things. *In the
        sentence above , she's saying that the situation isn't like that(the word mentioned in the note),
    </p>
    <p>so I phrased it this way.* ]
    </p>
    <p>It's like we're biting into each other, but we're not. An unclean feeling, like something is stuck on
        my back teeth.
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun is at fault for reading the letter without permission.
    </p>
    <p>However, the matter of him spreading ill rumours about Student Council Nagumo, and the
        matter of the record of proceedings are still ambiguous.
    </p>
    <p>I also can't clearly judge if it's a coincidence that he showed up here, or if he had planned it.
    </p>
    <p>There's no point in keeping Yagami-kun standing here more than we have...
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun looked at both Student Council President Nagumo and me, and faintly laughed.
    </p>
    <p>"Isn't it time to check our answers? The truth is that you all already know, right?"
    </p>
    <p>As if he had put the situation in order in his mind, Yagami-kun broke his silence and spoke out.
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita Senpai, you were shown the record of proceedings, which reminded you of the
        Uninhabited Island Special Exam, and you thought that I was the culprit. Then, you handed
        Student Council Nagumo what was made to look like a love letter, and secretly sent him a
        message."
    </p>
    <p>For some reason, he suddenly touched on the subject of the record of proceedings and the
        letter, which was out of our minds until now.
    </p>
    <p>"Why would we follow such a complicated procedure? We could just chat on the phone, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Because it wouldn't leave any proof that would let you suspect me, right? With this fake love
        letter, you can easily talk your way out of trouble. Further, you had intended to check the record
        of proceedings together today. In order to confirm if I was the person that Horikita Senpai was
        looking for."
    </p>
    <p>"Uninhabited Island? Record of proceedings? The person Suzune is searching for? What are
        you talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>"Do you still intend to keep up this act, Student Council President Nagumo? I already know that
        you, and Horikita Senpai, are moving on the instructions of a certain someone. Everything was
        instructed by the one who created this letter's anagrams, Ayanokoji Senpai, right? How
        mischievous. I didn't even have to show you the record of proceedings to reach this conclusion."
    </p>
    <p>"...Why is Ayanokoji-kun's name coming up now?"
    </p>
    <p>"He's doing a lot of stuff indirectly. I thought that he wasn't keen on doing things publicly, but I
        didn't think that this is the way he would come in contact with me."
    </p>
    <p>Laughing with joy. Compared to earlier, Yagami-kun's behaviour have completely changed.
    </p>
    <p>"So, what comes after this? Do I finally come face to face with Ayanokoji Senpai?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, looking at the entrance like a child with a box of toys in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>"This is tantalizing, isn't it? Until he arrives, could you tell me what he has been hearing about
        me? I'd especially like to hear it from your mouth, Horikita Senpai."
    </p>
    <p>"Wait. I really don't get what this is about. I do suspect you of coming to my tent and dropping off
        the letter, but, I haven't talked about that with anyone but Ibuki-san."
    </p>
    <p>Even if I tell the truth, Yagami-kun doesn't look like he'll believe it.
    </p>
    <p>"Please explain it in a way I can understand too, Yagami."
    </p>
    <p>"Hmph. I'm getting tired of this after all, Student Council President Nagumo. You had intended to
        pass the letter, and meet up with Ayanokoji-kun here along with Horikita-senpai. Then, you had
        intended to talk together with me. I'm sure he thought it would be dangerous to meet me alone
        too, right? Mhm, that's a wise judgement."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry to interrupt you while you're on such a hot streak, Yagami, but I'll tell you the reason I
        came to the student council room."
    </p>
    <p>Student Council President Nagumo took out his phone and showed us the screen.
    </p>
    <p>It seems there was an incoming call, as a phone number appeared on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>"Looks like he's here. Come in."
    </p>
    <p>He said so to the one on the other end of the line.
    </p>
    <p>"Ah-hah-hah! Ayanokoji-kun was coming, after all! That's great!"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, loudly laughing, put out his arms facing the slowly opening door as if welcoming
        the new arrival.
    </p>
    <p>"Excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>Along with such words, the person who entered was above and beyond our predictions.
    </p>
    <p>The first one to react was not me, nor Student Council President Nagumo, and not even
        Yagami-kun. It was Ibuki-san.
    </p>
    <p>"Huuh? Ryuen? Why are you here?"
    </p>
    <p>It wasn't only Ryuen who showed up. He had two classmates with him.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, that outfit looks good on you, Ibuki. Doesn't it, Kinoshita?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's true. It's so tight and cute."
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? Hey, Komiya? And, Kinoshita too..!?"
    </p>
    <p>Then, as the pièce de résistance, Teacher Sakagami and Teacher Mashima also showed up
        from behind them and entered the student council room.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : 極めつけ - Kiwametsuke - Certifying something, guaranteeing something.
    </p>
    <p>Colloquially used in the same way as "pièce de résistance", which is its dictionary definition as a
        colloquialism. ]
    </p>
    <p>"...What is this?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun was the most astonished. He blurted out such words, not understanding what was
        happening.
    </p>
    <p>"The reason you came to the student council room is to talk with Ryuen and the others. Isn't that
        right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, that was my intent, but it looks like quite the bustle was happening here already, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun had a stiff expression looking at them, as if he was still unable to understand the
        flow of things.
    </p>
    <p>As Student Council President Nagumo stood up, he pushed the letter onto Yagami-kun's chest.
    </p>
    <p>"The fake love letter with the anagrams, the record of proceedings, it's all so nonsensical,
    </p>
    <p>Yagami."
    </p>
    <p>"...That shouldn't be the case. However, what is this..?"
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen approached Yagami-kun who couldn't hide his confusion. Then, spoke thusly while
        pointing at him:
    </p>
    <p>"This is the guy you all were talking about, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun said so to Komiya-kun and the others standing ready at the back, and checked
        something.
    </p>
    <p>The two strongly nodded with nervous expressions.
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. There's no mistaking it."
    </p>
    <p>"Mhm. I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun, hearing this, approached Yagami-kun with his usual faint smile on his face. They
        were now at an arm's length.
    </p>
    <p>"Listen here, asshole, we're gonna carefully talk through some stuff."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : for proofreader : The word "てめえ" is used here to refer to this character which is a
        vulgar expression. I translated it like this to reflect that. ]
    </p>
    <p>"Talk about what?"
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen extended his right arm, grabbed Yagami-kun's bangs and suddenly pulled them up.
    </p>
    <p>"Ryuen!"
    </p>
    <p>Mashima-sensei scolded him for such a violent act, but he didn't seem to care.
    </p>
    <p>"You, what was your name?"
    </p>
    <p>"...It's Yagami, Yagami Takuya, Ryuen Senpai."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, his hair being pulled, and his expression changing into one of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>"I see, Yagami, is it? I heard that you're the culprit who's pushed Komiya and Kinoshita."
    </p>
    <p>"Huh..? I don't understand what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't play dumb. Komiya and Kinoshita remembered just the last day. That all their serious
        injuries in the Uninhabited Island Special Exam were because of your violent actions."
    </p>
    <p>The serious injuries on the Uninhabited Island. I know about the ones who broke their bones
        and received heavy injuries, but I thought that was an accident which occured as the result of
        their carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>"What, me? What the hell are you talking about!?"
    </p>
    <p>"Because they lost their memories with the shock of their injuries, it got swept under the rug as
        an accident, but, they remembered, you see. That you were the culprit."
    </p>
    <p>As if responding to these words, Student Council President Nagumo also confirmed this.
    </p>
    <p>"It was just yesterday. I had intended to talk with just Ryuen, Komiya, and Kinoshita today, but...
    </p>
    <p>Why are the teachers here?"
    </p>
    <p>"I called them here to save up on time. It seems that Sakagami came running when the two
        were injured."
    </p>
    <p>"Speaking of Yagami-kun... Mashima-sensei, surely..?"
    </p>
    <p>Sakagami-sensei, as if he remembered something, got a confirmation from Mashima-sensei.
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, I don't want to look like I'm suspicious of my students, but.... I can't deny the possibility."
    </p>
    <p>"What... What are you saying? I haven't done anything!"
    </p>
    <p>It's only normal for him to make a commotion. Even I'm not entirely sure what's happening here.
    </p>
    <p>"Yagami. That day, I know that when the two's alarms were ringing, your watch's GPS wasn't
        functioning. There are a few student who had their watches broken during the special exam,
    </p>
    <p>but, including you, there are only two people who were in contact with the two before they went
        unconscious. Of course, at that time, Komiya and Kinoshita, and Shinohara said that they were
        hurt by someone, but they couldn't come up with a name. Because of that, considering it an
        accident was the only way, but..."
    </p>
    <p>"Though they were supposed to have no memory of it, they happened to remember at the same
        time and said my name? That can't be! It's obvious that they coordinated their stories
        beforehand and said my name!"
    </p>
    <p>"Coordinated their stories? The reality that your watch was broken is not known by most
        students."
    </p>
    <p>Over 400 people took the Special Exam in the Uninhabited Island. At the time they were
        wounded, only two people had the GPS on their watches broken.
    </p>
    <p>The odds are way too low to call it a coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>" They remembered that they saw the culprit. What's your basis for claiming that this is a lie?
    </p>
    <p>Tell us, Yagami."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun, putting further strength into his fingers, pulled Yagami-kun's hair.
    </p>
    <p>"Gah..! That... That's..."
    </p>
    <p>"No one saw you, you did everything perfectly. That's what you're thinking, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Please... Please wait! I haven't done anything. Are you saying I could do something dangerous
        like that?"
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, who definitely could not be considered to have a large physique.
    </p>
    <p>From an outsider's perspective, I'm sure that it would seem strange indeed.
    </p>
    <p>However, Ryuen-kun was not trusting Yagami-kun's words in the slightest.
    </p>
    <p>"I've already learned in the past that the ones who seem harmless are the most dangerous
        people. Isn't that right, Ibuki?"
    </p>
    <p>"There's no mistaking it, this guy is strong. He was able to greatly injure Komiya and the others
        without even being noticed."
    </p>
    <p>"Normally, as revenge, I'd want to hurt you even worse than you've hurt them, but, unfortunately,
    </p>
    <p>we're in front of the teachers. I'll forgive you this time. Because what awaits you is expulsion,
    </p>
    <p>and nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>If the truth is confirmed, and proof can be raised that Yagami-kun caused great injury to Komiya
        and the others, it won't end with just suspension from school. Taking into consideration the
        circumstances, he can't avoid expulsion.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun let go of the hair he had grabbed, and Yagami-kun faced his head low and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>"So? Why are you here, Suzune?"
    </p>
    <p>"I... I had something to investigate about Yagami-kun too."
    </p>
    <p>"Oh? What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>Now that it's come to this, my only choice is to tell him everything.
    </p>
    <p>What happened at the Uninhabited Island, and about me searching for the student that wrote
        the beautiful letters. The fact that they looked like Yagami-kun's letters, and that I came here to
        check the record of proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>I pulled out the notebook of the record of proceedings, and opened the page that has
        Yagami-kun's entry.
    </p>
    <p>"The letters here are pretty much the same as Yagami-kun's handwriting. They fit perfectly with
        the ones in my memory."
    </p>
    <p>"Can we have you explain what this is, Yagami-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>Student Council President Nagumo does not have a complete grasp of the situation, so he
        asked thusly.
    </p>
    <p>The only thing that's certain is that something mysterious has occured in this place. While
        everyone here has some relation to Yagami-kun, they have no definite connection between
        each other.
    </p>
    <p>Can something like that... Really happen?
    </p>
    <p>If everything started from that one letter...
    </p>
    <p>He took into consideration that I would entrust it with Yagami-kun, and that he would look
        inside?
    </p>
    <p>He analyzed the anagram, and came here as if drawn to this place…
        But, that person shouldn't have known that my suspicions were raised after I saw the record of
        proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>...No, that may not have anything to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>I'm an outsider. Ibuki-san, too, just like me, is an outsider.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Even if me and Ibuki-san weren't in this place, the flow of these events wouldn't have came to a
        halt.
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, who came to the student council room after being lured by the letter, would still
        have been pressed and questioned by Student Council President Nagumo.
    </p>
    <p>However, is such a thing possible?
    </p>
    <p>Even if this could be done... Who?
    </p>
    <p>When, where?
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image10.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        No, this kind of self-questioning might not be the right thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>It wouldn't be strange at all if Ayanokoji-kun was behind this incident too.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun, Komiya-kun and the others who showed up here in an unnatural way. Then, the
        teachers.
    </p>
    <p>This place was meant to press Yagami-kun and surround him from all directions as he tries to
        make up excuses.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : 四方八方 - Shihouhappou - Four directions, eight directions - Yojijukugo (four
        character compound) used to mean "all directions".]
    </p>
    <p>"Heh-heh, I'm surprised too, but there's nothing to do. You played with fire too much."
    </p>
    <p>As if he was feeling the same way as I do, Ryuen-kun broke into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>"Why... Why? This is so stupid..."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know what the background to this is, but, you've been caught, you bastard."
    </p>
    <p>"I... Even if I continue to fight with him... No, even though this was before that? Is it ending... In a
        place like this? There's no way..."
    </p>
    <p>Yagami-kun, with his entire body trembling, yelled out in a voice that was unheard from him until
        now.
    </p>
    <p>"Does this mean... That he didn't even think I was worth facing directly? Ha...Ha-ha...Ha...Hah...!
    </p>
    <p>He's messing with me... He's messing with me!"
    </p>
    <p>"Shut up. Stop yelling next to me."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun put his right little finger into his ear, and gloomily whispered so.
    </p>
    <p>Not seeming to have heard this, Yagami-kun's agitation did not diminish.
    </p>
    <p>"It's fine. I can still... I can still just kill him with my own hands! If I do that, I can go back to the
        place I should be at! I'll take him along with me!"
    </p>
    <p>There are two teachers here, but it is as if he doesn't care about that at all.
    </p>
    <p>Showing us this clear sudden change, a killer intent is emanating from him. As he faced Ryuen
        and attempted to take a strong step towards him, Ibuki-san released a flying kick into
        Yagami-kun from his back.
    </p>
    <p>Without even turning back, Yagami-kun quickly evaded it and smashed his elbow into her
        stomach.
    </p>
    <p>"Guhh..!"
    </p>
    <p>A single strike. However, Ibuki-san collapsed on the spot, and couldn't get back up.
    </p>
    <p>When the teachers tried to stop Yagami-kun, Ryuuen-kun stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>"Pull back. This guy wants to fight. So, I'll take him on, alright?"
    </p>
    <p>Without caring that we're in the student council room, Ryuuen-kun clenched his fist.
    </p>
    <p>"There's no way someone like you can stop me, you know. Okay? I won't show mercy to anyone
        who's standing in my way. Teachers, women, I don't care. If you don't want to meet the same
        fate that Komiya and the others did, shut up and leave."
    </p>
    <p>"Heh-heh. So that's your true character. Now this is interesting."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun, without hesitation, took a step forwards and lightly spread both his arms as if
        challenging him.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll gladly stand in your way, so come at me!"
    </p>
    <p>"You're nothing but a former delinquent..."
    </p>
    <p>The aura emanating from this man with a small build did not feel like "a normal student", just like
        Ayanokoji-kun and Amasawa-san.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen-kun was eager, but it doesn't feel like Yagami-kun can be stopped at all.
    </p>
    <p>However, somehow, we have to stop him here right now.
    </p>
    <p>Even with the teachers present, Yagami-kun is driven by the urge to smash everything.
    </p>
    <p>If we let him go here, there is no guarantee that his rampage can ever be stopped.
    </p>
    <p>Then, his next target would be... Ayanokoji-kun.
    </p>
    <p>Something like this occurring right in the middle of the Culture Festival won't end with just a
        warning.
    </p>
    <p>"Stop, Yagami. You too, Ryuen. There will be a huge penalty if a fight occurs here."
    </p>
    <p>"I 100% can't avoid being expelled. In that case, there's no reason for me to stop, right?
    </p>
    <p>Mashima."
    </p>
    <p>Disrespectfully calling Mashima by name without even saying his title, Yagami-kun spat such
        words out.
    </p>
    <p>Despite that, as a teacher, Mashima-sensei got between Yagami-kun and Ryuen-kun.
    </p>
    <p>"Get lost."
    </p>
    <p>There is a great difference in their physiques, but, without even caring about that, he struck
        Mashima-sensei with a kick, and punched his face as Teacher Mashima's knee bent.
    </p>
    <p>Sakagami-sensei, seeing this close up, fearfully took some distance. Ryuuen-kun, excited about
        a perfect new fight starting up, hurled himself towards Yagami-kun once again. Then...
    </p>
    <p>"Let's stop already, Takuya."
    </p>
    <p>The student council room's door opened, and Amasawa-san with her clear red eyes showed
        herself.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image11.webp" alt="">
<p>
"Huh? Why are you here... Since when were you..?"
</p><p>Yagami-kun, though no one's words could reach him before, stopped moving.
</p><p>"What do you think will happen if you keep acting violently like this? Do you think you'll be
recognized then? Do you think you'll be accepted? It's... It's already over."
</p><p>"That's not true! The teachers are waiting! I'm... I'm going to be number one!"
</p><p>I wonder what he means with "teacher".
</p><p>I can guess that he doesn't mean teachers from this school, at least.
</p><p>"Today, I was just thinking of exposing his past and finishing off the Cultural Festival in an
interesting way, but, he's done all this crazy shit..."
</p><p>[ TL Note : for proofreader : やがる - Very vulgar word used in the original text, phrased as "shit".
</p><p>]
</p><p>"Takuya, so that was your intent after all, huh..."
</p><p>"Move. I'm going to make Ayanokoji regret what he did. It'll be so funny that he won't even be
able to laugh..!"
</p><p>"If you're saying that you'll go to Ayanokoji-kun's location no matter what, then I'll stop you
before that."
</p><p>"You? You haven't won even once against me, though? Don't make me laugh."
</p><p>"Maybe I can't win with strength, yes. However... I'll do what I can."
</p><p>"I knew that you were devoted to Ayanokoji-kun, but, to think that you were such a fool."
</p><p>"The frog in the well knows nothing of the great ocean. I've simply come to realize that that's
how things are."
</p><p>[ TL Note : 井の中の蛙大海を知らず - i no naka no kawazu taikai wo shirazu - The frog in the
well knows nothing of the great ocean(literally), Proverb used. ]
</p><p>"In that case, die already. There's no meaning to your life."
</p><p>When Amasawa-san prepared herself for the worst, numerous footsteps were heard from the
other side of the corridor.
</p><p>Five expressionless adults stepped into the student council room. I can't tell who they all are,
</p><p>but two of them are guests that I saw in the maid cafe before.
</p><p>Yagami-kun, who could not be held back until just now, suddenly started trembling.
</p><p>"Why... Why are you all here..? Why... Why..?"
</p><p>"We recieved a phone-call to come pick someone up at the student council room. This is a bit
different than what was planned, but..."
</p><p>Yagami-kun, who was furious until just a moment ago, was suddenly shriveling like a child.
</p><p>He simply looked like a child that was found by his parents and was about to be reproached.
</p><p>Yagami-kun, surrounded by the adults, was lead away without even resisting.
</p><p>Amasawa-san also started walking to accompany him.
</p><p>"You are..?"
</p><p>Teacher Mashima asked thusly after enduring the pain and standing up.
</p><p>"We're people involved with Yagami and Amasawa. We'll handle everything here, so please go
and receive medical aid. Further, I'd like to ask you, the teachers, and the students, to keep
everything that happened here secret. I will inform Board Chairman Sakayanagi of everything,
</p><p>so you need not worry."
</p><p>"...Understood."
</p><p>With the help of Sakagami-sensei, Mashima-sensei left the student council room. After so much
commotion, the room was now suddenly covered in silence.
</p><p>"Well, the fun's spoiled. Even though it was just getting interesting... Stand up, Ibuki, we're
leaving."
</p><p>"Ugh... At least lend me a hand!"
</p><p>Ibuki-san couldn't stand yet, so Ryuen-kun gave a signal to Komiya-kun with his chin, and left
the classroom after helping Ibuki-san.
</p><p>The only ones left in the student council room were President Nagumo and me.
</p><p>"That's that, I guess. That was all very surprising, but at least the matter was solved."
</p><p>"How much did you know about today's matter? Ayanokoji-kun is involved, isn't he?"
</p><p>"What do you mean? I said this before already, but I only came here with the intent of speaking
with Ryuen."
</p><p>"If that was true, then it shouldn't have been necessary to bring that letter with you."
</p><p>The love letter was still fruitlessly crumpled on the ground.
</p><p>"To borrow Yagami's words, it was a coincidence. It just happened to be in my pocket, you see."
</p><p>An easy lie to see through. There's no talking about this further, such is the directive from the
Student Council Head.
</p><p>"The noisy Cultural Festival is at an end, too. You should also go back."
</p><p>"...Okay."
</p><p>It’s Already 4 P.M. The Cultural Festival, having caused unthinkable happenings to occur, is
ending.
</p><p></p>
