    <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
    <h2>Things Left Behind by Airi
    </h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
        Kushida, in recovery after withdrawing for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to a series of successful activities, she's successfully stayed without breaking the long
        line.
    </p>
    <p>However, this time, there are too many customers, and not enough helping hands.
    </p>
    <p>The situation of being over capacity is still continuing.
    </p>
    <p>The maids' performance is decreasing as they are not able to rest properly in the one hour
        break they are given.
    </p>
    <p>The men are still there, but even if the work in the background is done, they can't work in the
        hall, so the situation is still dire.
    </p>
    <p>Eight maid outfits were prepared.
    </p>
    <p>Two of them are considered spares, and six people are always in operation.
    </p>
    <p>Excluding the break time, Satou and Mii-chan are always struggling as the aces.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, who had no plans to be in charge of the hall, started going around serving the
        customers.
    </p>
    <p>Then, the other three, Kushida, Ishikura as Matsushita's substitute, and Inokashira, specializing
        in handing out leaflets
        As Kushida is moving to hold back the people in the corridor, there are four working in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>Normally, there should be more staff, but the reality is that there are no willing candidates.
    </p>
    <p>We can't just use any girl.
    </p>
    <p>Other than their leniency and charm, the person's real intentions are important too.
    </p>
    <p>I've called on Sonoda and many others, but they couldn't bear the embarrassment of wearing a
        maid outfit, or the hard work they would have to do.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun. The waiting customers may be growing impatient... I don't think we can keep
        going like this for much longer."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida, peeking into the room from the corridor raised her voice at me. Horikita, who has been
        serving customers (mainly carrying the dishes) spotted Kushida and approached her.
    </p>
    <p>"How's the end of the line?"
    </p>
    <p>"After I tell them they'll be waiting for a while, there will be people who stay, but about half of
        them will end up leaving."
    </p>
    <p>Whether we like it or not, after seeing such a long line, people won't feel like waiting.
    </p>
    <p>The remaining customers are not just simple customers, they are visitors who came for the
        whole Cultural Festival. Kushida is doing her best for us, but we may be on the verge of
        collapse.
    </p>
    <p>"We have two more maid outfits, right?"
    </p>
    <p>It might be time to pull out the outfits that we saved up for an emergency situation.
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, but if there's no one willing to help, then they're of no use."
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. What about Karuizawa-san?"
    </p>
    <p>A suggestion from Kushida. As Kei is my girlfriend, perhaps she thinks she will do as I say.
    </p>
    <p>It's true; if I force her, the possibility is high.
    </p>
    <p>However…
        "Actually, I believe she's on a break from 2 P.M."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. She's on a break right now. If we say that she changes her clothes when she comes
        back at 3 o'clock, I'm not sure how much help she would be."
    </p>
    <p>This is a point that the two can't understand, but she can't simply change in the dressing room.
    </p>
    <p>Worst case scenario, if she leaves and comes back after she returns, it would take another 20 to
        30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>"Umm, can I say something?"
    </p>
    <p>Ike, after coming and going carrying food for I don't know how many rounds, raised his voice.
    </p>
    <p>"What is it? Is there some trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, no, I just heard that you don't have enough workers right now, so... Umm, maybe we can
        ask Satsuki?"
    </p>
    <p>"Shinohara-san? But, would she accept?"
    </p>
    <p>"I think she would. Besides, it was only for a bit, but she's practiced being a maid, hasn't she?"
    </p>
    <p>After hearing this for the first time, the three of us met faces.
    </p>
    <p>Shinohara is in the stall working at preparing the food.
    </p>
    <p>"Can you call her here right away?"
    </p>
    <p>"Okay! I got this!"
    </p>
    <p>Right now, I'm just thankful that there are students who would wear the maid outfit.
    </p>
    <p>With Shinohara, we strongly convinced Azuma. It's now decided that she will participate.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun, I think you know, but we have to take a break from 3 o'clock. After we're
        through, some helping hands will be necessary."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry. I've thought of everything, so it's okay."
    </p>
    <p>After fifteen minutes, I will have Shinohara go to the hall, and have Azuma, along with Kushida,
    </p>
    <p>complete the task of stopping the customers waiting in the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>However, from Kushida's expression in the corridor, it's clear that she isn't happy about this
        development.
    </p>
    <p>"It's hard to say that the right person is in the right place. Looking at Shinohara-san, her impact
        is very low, and she isn't good at serving customers either."
    </p>
    <p>"This is an emergency. There's nothing else to do."
    </p>
    <p>"So we can't use Hasebe-san, after all?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's been unclear since the morning. Formally, she's participating in the Cultural Festival, but
        she might have returned to her dorm."
    </p>
    <p>"As revenge against Sakura-san's expulsion? She participated in the discussions before, didn't
        she?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's more like she was just observing."
    </p>
    <p>"Still, she has more knowledge than Shinohara, Azuma-san and the others."
    </p>
    <p>"That's why it's such an effective act of revenge. Both Haruka and Akito, who seem to be
        working together, made their plans with our strength in consideration."
    </p>
    <p>"...I see. I thought that since you know so much, you might have another possibility you've
        thought of in your field of view."
    </p>
    <p>"Even if I know everything, it's not like I can increase the number of the students in the class.
    </p>
    <p>Besides, if I had moved in a different way from the start, Haruka, Akito and the others would
        have noticed. With that, I decided that it would be disadvantageous to let them be able to
        perform an unplanned sabotage."
    </p>
    <p>"It's a bit annoying, but that's all. It's not so effective that I would call it revenge".
    </p>
    <p>"If this is all."
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>"Haruka and Airi were looking forward to the Cultural Festival. That's why they wanted so much
        to see it with their own eyes. Then, when that's all over, they have no more reason to remain in
        this school."
    </p>
    <p>"...Are you saying they'll drop out?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's possible. If the two drop out on their own, adding onto the simple fact that we don't have
        enough people in our class, our Class Points will take a big dive. It would cause a large amount
        of damage to the class."
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean with damage?"
    </p>
    <p>"With the two combined together, 600 Class Points."
    </p>
    <p>"Six... Six hundred!?"
    </p>
    <p>"There's nothing to be surprised about. According to the school's rules, there is a penalty for
        dropping out of the school."
    </p>
    <p>With the exception of the high risk of expulsion in the Special Test, I would say that this is only
        natural.
    </p>
    <p>"If the two really do drop out, my plans to go to an A Class will be... There won't be any hope
        left."
    </p>
    <p>'My'.
    </p>
    <p>That's the way Kushida always starts talking.
    </p>
    <p>"Do you intend to simply look on and do nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>"I was planning on coming up with a breakthrough solution, but..."
    </p>
    <p>I moved my eyes to my cell phone.
    </p>
    <p>It's unfortunate, but, the message I've been expecting hasn't arrived just yet.
    </p>
    <p>"After this unexpected trouble, the trump card still hasn't arrived, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>Haruka's plan to obstruct the Cultural Festival, no, to drop out.
    </p>
    <p>This is like an unstoppable killer technique.
    </p>
    <p>No matter what counter-strategy we come up with, there's no way to perfectly defend ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>Even if Haruka herself wanted to remain in this school and desperately tried to repeatedly
        obstruct us like Kushida used to do before, we can use the rules of the Special Exam and force
        her to drop out without much harm to class points.
    </p>
    <p>One can't arrive to build a strategy that would do more than that with cheap tricks.
    </p>
    <p>However, Haruka did not take an action beyond her means.
    </p>
    <p>As she knew her techniques wouldn't work against me, she chose the most efficient method.
    </p>
    <p>"Is it fine like this?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's not something for me to decide. It's for Haruka and Akito to make a judgement on. If they
        are to run through the Cultural Festival, we can't do anything about that."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sure that you don't actually think that way, Ayanokoji."
    </p>
    <p>"Do you get it?"
    </p>
    <p>"I do. I mean, you've lent a helping hand to even someone like me. You won't abandon
        Hasabe-san and the others like this, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Somehow, what I'm trying to do right now may be obvious to Kushida.
    </p>
    <p>"The reason that you didn' try to convince them until now, was it to test the two?"
    </p>
    <p>"I didn't understand their aim. Is it to mess up the Cultural Festival, or not? However, after all this
        time with nothing happening, I have a rough guess. We will make contact soon."
    </p>
    <p>"Do you have any ideas as to where they are?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm having a lot of work done to find that out."
    </p>
    <p>I showed her my phone's screen, where there was a certain message from someone with
        Haruka's location written on it.
    </p>
    <p>"You have a really reliable ally, huh? I'm sure that this person is how you knew where I was,
    </p>
    <p>too."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. They're great at finding people."
    </p>
    <p>I already know where Haruka and the others are.
    </p>
    <p>"Just, even still, my moves are limited. It's an entirely different problem to move their hearts. I'll
        be back."
    </p>
    <p>I left this place to Kushida and the others, and headed for Haruka's location.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        I dropped by the classroom with the cardboard from the morning in my hand, then, I headed
        onto the road to Keyaki Mall. After a while, the spot where students use the benches to rest
        came into my view.
    </p>
    <p>Over here, there are no customer seats, and, naturally, no students or guests.
    </p>
    <p>As I approached them, I suddenly entered their field of view.
    </p>
    <p>"Good job learning, we're here, Kyopon."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka was on the bench, with Akito standing nearby and gazing at me.
    </p>
    <p>"I know well that you and Airi always use this place to talk after classes, so."
    </p>
    <p>Today, I've received information that Haruka and the others were walking around inside the
        school.
    </p>
    <p>Then, after all that, they must have chosen this spot as the final station.
    </p>
    <p>"As expected of the Former Ayanokoji Group. Correct answer."
    </p>
    <p>"What did you come here to do? We had no intention to obstruct the Cultural Festival, but..?"
    </p>
    <p>"That might really be true. However, you aren't helping, either."
    </p>
    <p>"That's true."
    </p>
    <p>"I want to apologize to you... No, to the class."
    </p>
    <p>Akito, who hasn't shown his face since the morning, apologized thusly.
    </p>
    <p>"It's fine. I know why you're standing by Haruka."
    </p>
    <p>"More importantly, can I have you answer my question?"
    </p>
    <p>"You mean why am I here? The maid cafe is busier than expected, and we don't have enough
        helping hands."
    </p>
    <p>"Hmph, is that so? It might not have been so if Airi was there. I would have participated too, so
        you're lacking the help from both of us."
    </p>
    <p>"In that case, Kushida wouldn't be there. That would have been an even worse situation."
    </p>
    <p>"Answering sarcasm with sarcasm, I see."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm only telling the truth."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka's belligerent style, it always becomes a give-and-take like this.
    </p>
    <p>I can see clearly that this is a method to anger me.
    </p>
    <p>"May I not have your help even just for the last one hour?"
    </p>
    <p>"You know the answer already, don't you? You know that it's pointless to try and convince me."
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. Because, if you had any conditions, I'm sure that it would be to bring back Airi."
    </p>
    <p>Of course, such a thing is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>"Can I have you hear me out, at least? I'm sure that you're curious too."
    </p>
    <p>I put the cardboard in my hand on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>"I want you to open this box."
    </p>
    <p>Even after I said so to her, Haruka simply moved her eyebrows with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>"What are you telling me to do now? Sorry, but I don't feel like going along with anything weird."
    </p>
    <p>After she said so, Haruka pulled out an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>The word "Expulsion Notice" is hand-written on the white envelope.
    </p>
    <p>"I see you don't seem surprised."
    </p>
    <p>"I knew that the possibility you might give up is high after the Cultural Festival is over. And,
    </p>
    <p>Akito, you intend to go along with her, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"...Yeah."
    </p>
    <p>Akita, too, took out an envelope with an Expulsion Notice written on it.
    </p>
    <p>"This is great, Kiyopon. So this means that it was easy for you to expel Airi too, right?"
    </p>
    <p>While talking, her eyes aren't looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>She is simply staring into emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>It is as if she is seperate from this world, talking from another dimension.
    </p>
    <p>"The Cultural Festival that Airi was looking forward to. The Cultural Festival, which should have
        been the platform to take a big step and change herself."
    </p>
    <p>She closed her eyes with sorrow, and hit the bench with her fist.
    </p>
    <p>"I've decided to take this until the end, in her place."
    </p>
    <p>"It's true that I expelled Airi. I dealt with her, using her feelings as the opposite gender. I have no
        intention of saying that I have no regrets about that."
    </p>
    <p>"I was a necessity for her. And, you, Kyopon, and the Ayanokouji Group were a necessity, too.
    </p>
    <p>What do you think her face looks like now, after being expelled by the man that she loved? Have
        you ever thought about that?"
    </p>
    <p>"What does her face look like now? What is she thinking? Please tell me all the details."
    </p>
    <p>Getting annoyed at my demeanour that she cannot understand, her feelings are being pushed
        forward.
    </p>
    <p>"She's constantly crying, of course. With regret, sorrow, and pain, she's thinking back on her fun
        school days. Do you not get that?"
    </p>
    <p>"Is that how you see Airi?"
    </p>
    <p>"Not just me. That's how she is! Why won't you understand!?"
    </p>
    <p>It wouldn't be considered a yell, but she's clearly getting angry.
    </p>
    <p>"You know too, don't you? You just don't want to see the reality. You just don't want to think
        about Airi's pain after you made her get expelled!"
    </p>
    <p>Haruka has decided that I'm simply running away.
    </p>
    <p>"Unfortunately, I don't think of it that way. Because the students that got expelled have nothing
        to do with me. It would just be a waste to spend effort thinking about such things."
    </p>
    <p>Knowing it would make things worse, I simply spoke the truth. This, of course, was hard on
        Haruka.
    </p>
    <p>"Horrible. You really are the worst."
    </p>
    <p>After spitting these words, Haruka slowly stood up.
    </p>
    <p>"I always wondered how Airi could love someone like you, someone this cruel."
    </p>
    <p>She slowly approached me.
    </p>
    <p>She was now in reaching distance.
    </p>
    <p>"I can't stand talking with you any longer. Won't you die together with me soon?"
    </p>
    <p>She said so with the expulsion letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>By die, does she mean that she's trying to tempt me into dropping out?
    </p>
    <p>By those words which occur a Deja Vu in my mind, I am reminded of past memories.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not like you've gathered bad attention onto yourself by causing Airi to get expelled. Further,
    </p>
    <p>you have no wish to graduate in an A Class, right? In that case, why not just give up?"
    </p>
    <p>Human relationships collapse with just one simple mistake. Until now, no one would have
        thought that Haruka and I would be having a conversation like this.
    </p>
    <p>"You can try, but I won't be convinced to drop out. I still remember how Airi was made to go
        along with your delusions."
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? What are you trying to say?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm saying that you don't look to me like you understand Airi's feelings."
    </p>
    <p>"I understand her better than anyone. You're the one who doesn't want to accept reality!"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't be conceited, Haruka."
    </p>
    <p>"..-ch!?"
    </p>
    <p>With my overwhelming words, she fell completely silent.
    </p>
    <p>Akito, mistakenly thinking that she's about to be attacked reflexively, stepped forward in
        between Haruka and me, and raised his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>"I was just a bit surprised. I'm fine, so step aside, Akito."
    </p>
    <p>The sense of danger that Akito's instincts made him feel must not have been picked up by
        Haruka.
    </p>
    <p>Still on guard, Akito slowly lowered his left hand behind him.
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean conceited? What are you acting all high and mighty for?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm telling you to stop deciding Airi's feelings by yourself and stop speaking for her. The only
        one who can truly understand what she's thinking is Airi herself."
    </p>
    <p>"You're the one who doesn't get it. Do you think she's fine with getting expelled?"
    </p>
    <p>"She really might have been in despair at that moment. However, how can you claim to know
        how she feels right now?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's... That's obvious if you just think about it a little, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"No. In your mind, Airi has to feel bad right now."
    </p>
    <p>"...Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>"You're not sad because Airi was expelled. You're sad because you lost someone who was
        convenient for you. You wanted to have Airi, someone weaker than you, stay by your side, and
        make yourself into her protector. You loved the sense of superiority and the sense of satisfaction
        you got from this."
    </p>
    <p>"That's not true at all! How can you say that when you don't even think about her or remember
        her!?"
    </p>
    <p>She strongly denied it, but I could see her eyes feintly fluctuating.
    </p>
    <p>"When I think about how she feels now... I..!"
    </p>
    <p>"Did you really think about it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Over and over again!"
    </p>
    <p>Amidst this conversation which could be considered two parallel lines, Haruka only is wearing
        out her heart.
    </p>
    <p>"You don't know the reality."
    </p>
    <p>"That's... It's not like I can directly ask her about it!"
    </p>
    <p>"It's true, there's no way to confirm it directly. However, here's a hint. This cardboard box.
    </p>
    <p>There's a high possibility that this is something that's necessary for you."
    </p>
    <p>"Huh? I don't get it. That's not the thing that's necessary for me."
    </p>
    <p>"Even if this was the last message left behind by Airi?"
    </p>
    <p>"...Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>Until now, she was devoted to being confident, but she opened her eyes wide along with Akito
        standing behind her.
    </p>
    <p>"That can't be... What kind of a joke is this? I'm sure that you're the one who prepared this box,
    </p>
    <p>right?"
    </p>
    <p>"The day that Airi's expulsion was decided, she left this package behind for me. I'm sure that in
        that short time, she understood what she had to do."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka's sight dropped down to the cardboard box at my feet.
    </p>
    <p>"If you look at the sender, you'll see that this isn't something I've made."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka kneeled down and looked at the slip on the cardboard box.
    </p>
    <p>There, my name was written as the receiver, and the name of an online shop as the sender.
    </p>
    <p>I myself found this out for the first time after receiving it and taking a look.
    </p>
    <p>When she noticed that, Haruka extended her hand and tried to rip off the tape with all her
        strength.
    </p>
    <p>She had to try a few times, and finally succeeded in taking it off.
    </p>
    <p>Then, the box was open.
    </p>
    <p>Inside, is a single maid outfit.
    </p>
    <p>"This, this is..."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka should understand the meaning this holds.
    </p>
    <p>"I was supposed to wear this... I was supposed to wear this together with Airi... Why..?"
    </p>
    <p>"She noticed the possibility that you would come to a halt and not participate in the Cultural
        Festival. With this reason, this was sent for the sake of stopping such a future."
    </p>
    <p>"Ai...Ri..."
    </p>
    <p>"I, at the very least, can feel her strong intent from this gift. It isn't just sadness. How about you,
    </p>
    <p>Haruka?"
    </p>
    <p>"Airi... Airi..!"
    </p>
    <p>Haruka took out the maid outfit, and held it close to her chest.
    </p>
    <p>Tears started flowing out and she started weeping.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image6.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        "All I wanted to do was to be with her in the Cultural Festival... I wanted to push that shy kid
        from her back, I wanted to see her unveiling herself...!"
    </p>
    <p>Thinking about the future that nearly could have happened, she cried.
    </p>
    <p>Hopefully, with this, Haruka will show her understanding, and face forwards.
    </p>
    <p>However...
    </p>
    <p>"This is... Wrong."
    </p>
    <p>She wiped her tears on the cuffs of her uniform, and stood up in rejection.
    </p>
    <p>"Wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>"This isn't something that she sent me because she wants me to participate in the Cultural
        Festival..."
    </p>
    <p>Here Things cannot be changed that simply.
    </p>
    <p>"She was just regretful. She wanted you to know her resentment by showing you that she was
        the one supposed to wear this... I'm sure of it."
    </p>
    <p>This outfit can be interpreted as one wants. Since there is no concrete message left by Airi, it
        isn't clear that the reality is what I want it to be.
    </p>
    <p>"It has to be that way, right? If this was for me, it would be sent to me. Yet, you were the
        receiver, so there is a different meaning to this, am I wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>Different viewpoints are interesting, and it is true that I can't say for sure that this isn't possible.
    </p>
    <p>So she thinks that Airi is trying to harass the person who caused her to get expelled.
    </p>
    <p>Interesting.
    </p>
    <p>"Wait, Haruka. I think that you may be a bit wrong..."
    </p>
    <p>For the first time since I've come here, Akito opened his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not wrong. Yes, of course. Even this package may be a play prepared by Kiyopon..."
    </p>
    <p>"The fact that she sent her last present to Kiyotaka and not you could mean that she wanted to
        make you two get along with this, couldn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>If the present was sent to Haruka...
    </p>
    <p>And, if she simply took it...
    </p>
    <p>In that moment, the possibility of me coming in contact with her would disappear.
    </p>
    <p>"No, it can't be..."
    </p>
    <p>"I... Even, I was a part of the Ayanokouji group. I know that Airi would think like this."
    </p>
    <p>"Like I said, you're wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>Haruka turned around and sprinted, then held Akito by the chest.
    </p>
    <p>"Don't try to make things up! I won't forgive you for trying to make everything out to be the best
        for you!"
    </p>
    <p>"But I'm not really..."
    </p>
    <p>"Even if, and this is a big if, if it was like that, she had her place in the world stolen from her!
    </p>
    <p>That reality will never change! I won't accept a friendship that needs a victim to be formed!"
    </p>
    <p>"However, no matter what we imagine, it won't have any effect on Airi. Where is Airi, and what is
        she doing? Isn't that the most important thing?"
    </p>
    <p>"I know that. That's why I'll drop out, and see for myself. I'm going to be there for her!"
    </p>
    <p>At the same time as completing her revenge against the class, she'll go and meet Airi.
    </p>
    <p>This means that Self-Expulsion is an advantageous act for Haruka.
    </p>
    <p>"You're too loud. Even here, if we're not careful, we'll gather people's attention, you know?"
    </p>
    <p>As if trying to cut away the fury, these cold and calm words appeared.
    </p>
    <p>Kushida, a figure that even I didn't think would come up.
    </p>
    <p>With her maid outfit standing out in this place with a tense atmosphere, she slowly approached.
    </p>
    <p>"Is the store alright?"
    </p>
    <p>"We just took care of some customers, so we've made a little time for ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>I don't know if that is the truth or a lie, but I know that she wouldn't be neglectful in coming here.
    </p>
    <p>I can tell this from her eyes, looking at me, and telling me that the store is fine.
    </p>
    <p>"What did you come here for?"
    </p>
    <p>Not just Haruka, but I, too, feel suspicion towards her coming to this place.
    </p>
    <p>"What did I come here for? To see with my own eyes, I suppose. Since Ayanokoji-kun told me
        that Hasebe-san and Miyake-kun might be dropping out."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka looked at me for a moment, but turned her gaze back towards Kushida right away.
    </p>
    <p>"If I'm to say why all this happened, you're the source, Kushida-san. If you had been against the
        expulsions from the start..."
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, but now I don't regret the choice I made back then. What happened back then made me
        look bad, but it was also the springboard towards opening a new future."
    </p>
    <p>"...I'll show the people from our class that it was a mistake to leave you here."
    </p>
    <p>"If you want to drop out, why don't you just do it?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't act tough. You said it yourself, Kushida, didn't you? That there is no other way other than
        to graduate in an A Class. It's the only reason that you can stay in a class that you can't stand to
        be in, isn't it? So, I'll take that away."
    </p>
    <p>"Your revenge plans may indeed go well, but... Is that what's necessary? I don't think that
        Sakura-san would want such a thing to happen."
    </p>
    <p>"Don't say the same things as Kiyopon. You're all so... What the hell do you know about Airi?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, who knows. But, I at least know that she isn't more irresolute than you are.
    </p>
    <p>"Huuh?"
    </p>
    <p>She may simply be saying whatever is coming to her mind, or, she may have a basis for her
        thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>After wondering why she came to this place, I now have a new suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>"Sakura-san was weak. That's why she got expelled."
    </p>
    <p>"...Are you really the one to say that? You lost with shame too, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>"I did lose, yes. I'll also accept that I was weak. But, the reality is that Sakura was the same too.
    </p>
    <p>No, she was even weaker than me, and that's why she got expelled."
    </p>
    <p>In truth, Horikita judged that Kushida would be a more successful ally when compared to Airi.
    </p>
    <p>Now, in the Cultural Festival, she's meeting her expectations and showing her abilities.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, if she did participate in the Cultural Festival, I don't doubt that Airi would have been
        very popular too.
    </p>
    <p>But, the skill to deal with special customers and the ability to conduct yourself around adults
        can't be learned in one day. She doesn't lose to Airi on this point.
    </p>
    <p>Before that, Kushida has the ability to achieve a good ranking in the second midterms, too.
    </p>
    <p>So far, I can say that she has definitely been contributing.
    </p>
    <p>"She really was weak... But that's precisely why I wanted to protect her..."
    </p>
    <p>"You wanted to protect her? You think really highly of yourself, huh? Aren't you the only one who
        thought she'd be weak forever?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't mess with me!"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not messing with you or anything."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida is not reacting to Haruka's aggressive words.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps because of her experience until now, she is clearly holding herself with a different
        toughness than normal students.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun. Can I have you look at this?"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida turned her eyes away from Haruka, and turned them on me.
    </p>
    <p>"Every day, I wanted to learn other people's secrets. I hungered for secrets. Because I believed
        that this would increase my value. Of course, even Sakura-san is not an exception to this."
    </p>
    <p>No matter who it is, if it's someone that she can make use of, Kushida will make sure to
        encompass them.
    </p>
    <p>Even if someone can turn their hearts towards something that interests them, it's hard for them
        to approach something that isn't interesting for them.
    </p>
    <p>It is not possible to continue to do so with only ordinary mental strength.
    </p>
    <p>"I figured that her secrets might have some use even after she got expelled. Then, I found it."
    </p>
    <p>After saying so, Kushida took out her phone, and showed me the screen.
    </p>
    <p>As I took the phone, I started scrolling and reading the details.
    </p>
    <p>"This is..."
    </p>
    <p>"So you didn't know about this either, huh? Though, I thought that you of all people would have
        noticed this, Ayanokoji."
    </p>
    <p>"I can't decide if this is expected or unexpected. You've done well, I see."
    </p>
    <p>"In the old days, she worked with you a lot on this matter, didn't she? That may be why."
    </p>
    <p>That's about over a year ago, before we even formed the Ayanokoji Group.
    </p>
    <p>Because of the subject of Airi, Haruka is staring at me with unease.
    </p>
    <p>"You're curious, right? It's about Sakura whom you like so much."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida flapped her phone around as if seeing through her and challenging her.
    </p>
    <p>"What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>Kushida shut off the phone's screen for a moment, and approached Haruka with it in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm a really bad person too, but so are you. You just find satisfaction in finding people who need
        your help. You're not actually worried about Sakura-san, you're just sorrowful that you lost
        someone who needed you, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Strangely, she is saying the same things I am.
    </p>
    <p>After these words which were not even arranged beforehand, Haruka's eyes started to tear up.
    </p>
    <p>"So you are just like your family after all, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>Family? While being surprised by such an unexpected word, Haruka interrupts her.
    </p>
    <p>"Please stop... Don't talk about that."
    </p>
    <p>"Why? You're leaving the school, so what does it matter if I tell everyone what you told me? I
        don't need to protect this secret anymore."
    </p>
    <p>Now that I think about it, Kushida knew a lot more about Haruka than me, huh.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not in the wrong. I wanted to protect Airi, I wanted to be by her side. Even if I was also
        doing it for myself..."
    </p>
    <p>"I understand your feelings, but I can't say that your thoughts are correct. This kind of thing is
        why even after going to high-school, you couldn't make a single real friend. Am I wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>"I..."
    </p>
    <p>"Well, whatever. If I keep idly chatting here, it'll harm the maid cafe too. Why don't you just drop
        out like this, without knowing anything? You can't do anything now even if you learn the truth."
    </p>
    <p>She stopped approaching Haruka, and turned her back towards her.
    </p>
    <p>"Wait! What about Airi!?"
    </p>
    <p>"You wanna know?"
    </p>
    <p>Upset at losing the advantage, she quickly approached Kushida and grabbed her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>"She can't do anything without me by her side. She needed help!"
    </p>
    <p>"You don't get it, do you? She's always been more of an adult than you think."
    </p>
    <p>Almost as if trying to seize it, Haruka took the phone into her hand, and tapped the screen with
        her finger.
    </p>
    <p>The browser history. There was the SNS (Social Media) account of a certain someone.
    </p>
    <p>It's a useful app where you can let the whole world know your thoughts just by tweeting. In this
        school, there are a lot of restrictions in place to stop the students from revealing their identities,
    </p>
    <p>so I suppose there aren't a lot of students here using it.
    </p>
    <p>However, for someone who isn't based in this school, there is of course no problem with using it
        as they want.
    </p>
    <p>The account name is "Shizuku".
    </p>
    <p>Another name of Sakura Airi, who used to work as a bikini/gravure model in secret.
    </p>
    <p>Since the aforementioned case, Airi had to delete her account, but Kushida found that it
        returned the other day.
    </p>
    <p>It has been only a few days since it was created, but it already has over a thousand followers.
    </p>
    <p>"No way... Is... Is this Airi's..?"
    </p>
    <p>This can be said to be the achievement of Kushida, who cares about nothing but collecting
        information.
    </p>
    <p>"This... There's no proof she made this, you know. It's obviously a fake that you and
        Kushida-san made..."
    </p>
    <p>"Do you still think it's us after reading what's actually written there?"
    </p>
    <p>[After a long break, I've decided to restart my idol activities.]
    </p>
    <p>The first tweet of the new account.
    </p>
    <p>Then, there are things about how she focused on her school, and how she enjoyed her days
        with her friends.
    </p>
    <p>About how she stopped being an idol.
    </p>
    <p>Submitted here were things that only she herself could have written.
    </p>
    <p>[I... I've decided to do whatever I can. To become someone that wouldn't be ashamed to face
        my dear friend. To show her after she graduates that I'm not ashamed of myself anymore.]
    </p>
    <p>"It's true that I said you just liked being her protector. Airi may have been someone that needed
        a lot of help, but, after being expelled, she started growing unbelievably fast."
    </p>
    <p>[I got the part that I auditioned for yesterday! I was so nervous, but I'm so happy!]
    </p>
    <p>"This is..."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka swallowed her breath. On the SNS, there were comments about her success in the third
        inspection.
    </p>
    <p>[The reason that I wanted to be in the entertainment world is that I wanted my voice to reach
        people.]
    </p>
    <p>[Sometimes it's hard, and sometimes it's sad, but... I want to face forwards. I'm facing forwards.
    </p>
    <p>So, you guys try your best, too.]
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it is possible to create a fake account using Shizuku's name. However, she is being
        followed by entertainment producers, and it would be hard to fake the contents of these tweets.
    </p>
    <p>That's precisely why Haruka should understand that Airi is the owner of this account.
    </p>
    <p>"After reading all that, I can't imagine that Airi is in the dire situation that you think she is."
    </p>
    <p>"You were overprotective, and thought you were above her, didn't you? But, after she was
        expelled, a new road opened for her. She hasn't stopped at all."
    </p>
    <p>After forcefully taking the phone from Haruka's shaking hand, Kushida turned back towards me.
    </p>
    <p>"Forgive me, I got a bit ahead of myself again."
    </p>
    <p>After saying so, she showed her smiling face, which was unfitting for this place.
    </p>
    <p>"I thought I was going to help you, but you helped me instead."
    </p>
    <p>"You owe me though, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"I thought we weren't going to that?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't like borrowing things, but I do like being the one lending them."
    </p>
    <p>After saying that, she started walking to return to the special building.
    </p>
    <p>"What a shrewd girl."
    </p>
    <p>[ Note : Shrewd means showing clever rresourcefulness in practical matters. ]
    </p>
    <p>After exposing her various weaknesses, Haruka stood, shocked and broken.
    </p>
    <p>It reminded me strongly of the scene with Kushida in the unanimous special exam.
    </p>
    <p>After skillfully exposing various weaknesses, she started walking around, this is just like
        Kushida.
    </p>
    <p>"...Haruka. I don't think that this can be a fake."
    </p>
    <p>Akito, who was looking at the SNS on his own phone too, handed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>After this, too, Haruka started intensely rushing through the messages written by Airi.
    </p>
    <p>"Uh, uhh..."
    </p>
    <p>Her concentrated sight became dim, and tears started flowing out from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>She had thought that Airi could do nothing without her, but, before she could notice, Airi had
        started walking on her own.
    </p>
    <p>Even now, though she should have a wounded heart, she was walking forwards with all she
        had. That was, because she was anxious that Haruka would stop in her tracks.
    </p>
    <p>"What an idiot I am", she thought.
    </p>
    <p>Haruka knew that she just decided all by herself that Airi was unhappy after being expelled, and
        arbitrarily empathized with her.
    </p>
    <p>"This is new information even for me. I thought that for those who are expelled, for those who
        leave in defeat, everything was over."
    </p>
    <p>She had decided that this unique package sent by her was the last thing she would leave
        behind.
    </p>
    <p>"But, that wasn't the case."
    </p>
    <p>Returning from defeat. There are those who can cut open a new beginning from their defeat.
    </p>
    <p>This is a big difference from the world of the White Room.
    </p>
    <p>No, further than that, those who were dropped out from the White Room could have made a
        comeback, too.
    </p>
    <p>"She might become really big after this. Despite that, will you still drop out and go after her? Let
        aside being made fun of, she might not even talk with you."
    </p>
    <p>If Haruka dropped out for the sake of revenge and met up with Airi, it's easy for Haruka to
        imagine what would happen too.
    </p>
    <p>She would not be welcomed with a smile, she would actually face Airi's anger.
    </p>
    <p>"I... What should I do..!?"
    </p>
    <p>"There is only one answer. Become someone that can meet Airi with pride. If you graduate in
        the A Class, things will be different. You have to keep working hard, survive these three years,
    </p>
    <p>and become someone that won't be ashamed when you're face to face with Airi."
    </p>
    <p>Airi won't chase Haruka. It's time for Haruka to chase after Airi.
    </p>
    <p>"Just in case, this package's price is included in the budget to be used in the Cultural Festival."
    </p>
    <p>Whether or not I could use this in the Cultural Festival was not clear, but it was good that I
        planned for unexpected circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>In summary, if she wears this maid outfit and works at the maid cafe, it will not cause any
        damage whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>"I won't expect you to work as well as the other maids. But, you can burn into your eyes the
        sight that you wanted Airi to see. As her friend, that's your duty."
    </p>
    <p>Haruka silently apologized to Akito, took out the expulsion notice, and left with the maid outfit
        held onto her chest.
    </p>
    <p>There is little time left, but she still has the chance to stand on the front stage.
    </p>
    <p>"Kiyotaka... Will your classmates let Haruka in?"
    </p>
    <p>"There's Kushida. There's Horikita. There's Yousuke. We'll be able to handle any situation."
    </p>
    <p>"...I see."
    </p>
    <p>Akito put his phone away, grabbed the two expulsion notices, and tore them from the middle.
    </p>
    <p>"There's no reason for her to drop out anymore. Likewise, I'm going to stay here until the end
        too, with Haruka."
    </p>
    <p>"Haruka's heart is shaken after knowing the truth. You need to be the one to support her."
    </p>
    <p>Right now, even if we can't all enjoy it with smiles together, there's still more than a year left in
        our school life.
    </p>
    <p>The day that they can truly smile in real meaning, should not be so far away.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll be attacked by my class-mates too for a while, but..."
    </p>
    <p>He scratched his head with worry, and laughed just a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>"What would have happened if Kushida hadn't appeared? What would you have done,
    </p>
    <p>Kiyotaka?"
    </p>
    <p>"We might have been done for."
    </p>
    <p>"You handled that well."
    </p>
    <p>I took out my own phone, and opened the internet.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I deleted my search history relating to Shizuku's SNS page that I prepared.
    </p>
    <p>It was Kushida who first made effective use of this and opened the way out of this difficulty. So,
    </p>
    <p>this is her achievement.
    </p>
    <p>"Shall we go back then, Akito? There's still some of the Cultural Festival left."
    </p>
    <p>"...Yeah."
    </p>
    <p>The time is around 2:20 pm.
    </p>
    <p>I succeeded in taking back the members that the Horikita class was missing
    </p>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        After bringing Akito to the stall, the boys, though they were still poking fun, accepted him without
        hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>After appreciating such a warm welcome, Akito's eyes became just a little red.
    </p>
    <p>It's probably also because Akito was a centrist who didn't ever cause any disputes.
    </p>
    <p>Keisei from the former Ayanokouji group had just taken his break, so, while unfortunate, he was
        nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>After we returned to the maid cafe in the special building, the long line was continuing as usual.
    </p>
    <p>Kushida, while serving the customers with a smile, was walking around and handing out the
        new cookies.
    </p>
    <p>Both the older and the younger kids must have found comfort in Kushida, as she was gathering
        all eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>I feel bad for Azuma working by her side, but the difference between their contributions is night
        and day.
    </p>
    <p>"Please come again, dear customers!"
    </p>
    <p>Satou shouted and guided them to the exit.
    </p>
    <p>Two female customers left the class while waving to the maids.
    </p>
    <p>Then, a new customer came in right away and was guided to an available seat.
    </p>
    <p>The seats and the tables prepared in this former classroom are spread further apart for the sake
        of the scenery, but, right now, they are closer together for the sake of increasing our number of
        customers.
    </p>
    <p>Normally, we should have set the place up to be more comfortable and spacious, but, we have
        to earn enough until the time we have left is up, so there's nothing else we could do.
    </p>
    <p>"Looks like she came."
    </p>
    <p>I received Kushida's words as she peeked in from the corridor for a moment, and awaited her
        arrival into work.
    </p>
    <p>"Aah! Aah, aah! It's so hard to run here!"
    </p>
    <p>Haruka, out of breath and swinging her shoulders up and down, finally arrived.
    </p>
    <p>The maids were distracted by her too for a moment, but they have more importants things to do
        right now.
    </p>
    <p>They quickly shifted their minds towards their duties.
    </p>
    <p>There's nobody pressing her as to why she has come here.
    </p>
    <p>"Hasebe-san, where did you change clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>"The girls' toilet... It was terrible."
    </p>
    <p>"I bet it was."
    </p>
    <p>Since they are in front of a crowd, Kushida, in her Angel Mode, bitterly laughed and welcomed
        Haruka.
    </p>
    <p>"...What's the situation?"
    </p>
    <p>"Ask that to Horikita-san. I already have my hands full managing the queue, so."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, in her maid outfit, called Haruka and entered the waiting room.
    </p>
    <p>"You did well to come here."
    </p>
    <p>After her first word, Horikita took her welcoming finger and caressed the tiff expressioned
        Haruka's back.
    </p>
    <p>"I thought you wouldn't show your face today, but you've finally prepared your resolve, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>I can't say that it's a full recovery, but Haruka calmed her breathing down and answered as she
        turned her head down.
    </p>
    <p>"You're not originally supposed to be a maid. You haven't practiced. I don't think you can work
        with as much skill as Satou-san and the others, but... Right now, I'd even accept the help of a
        cat."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : Here's the phrase that was used in the Original text - 猫の手も借りたい - Neko no Te
        mo Karitai - Wanting the help of even a cat. Btw Never thought I would see Horikita saying that
        she will even accept the help of a cat. But here we are in 2022. ]
    </p>
    <p>She can't escape being dug into this most severe battle of our sudden war.
    </p>
    <p>"You came to contribute to the Cultural Festival. I can trust in that, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's fine. I won't do anything to jeopardize the work you all have done, so. I'm sure you don't
        believe me, but..."
    </p>
    <p>"No, I believe you."
    </p>
    <p>After Haruka's words, Horikita made clear her trust right away.
    </p>
    <p>"Why..?"
    </p>
    <p>"I can tell from looking at your eyes. Ayanokoji-kun convinced you well, didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>[ TL note : I used the word 'Convinced' here to fit the narrative of the situation but in the original
        text, the japanese word does have a negative connotation to it like deceive or trick. However,
    </p>
    <p>overall, It could be phrased with convinced too. ]
    </p>
    <p>"Hey."
    </p>
    <p>"And, by Kushida-san, of course. I didn't think that you would approach me in a maid outfit."
    </p>
    <p>"By Kushida-san? I wonder when you left your position..."
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps because she was busy in the hall, it seems that she didn't know that Kushida had
        become absent.
    </p>
    <p>"Anyhow, even if it displeases you, I'll have you forget about your grudges and hard-feelings
        towards me until the Cultural Festival is over."
    </p>
    <p>"...I know."
    </p>
    <p>"That's good, then. You'll focus on serving cold water to thirsty customers, and participate in
        their photos if they wish. Okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'll try my best."
    </p>
    <p>After coming all this way, Haruka is yet a carp on a cutting board.
    </p>
    <p>Naive words such as "I want to" or "I don't want to" are not allowed to be said.
    </p>
    <p>"I have to take a compulsory break at 3 o'clock, so I'll leave things to you after that,
    </p>
    <p>Ayanokoji-kun. Take good care of her, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"All I can do is just take good pictures."
    </p>
    <p>Because I've already punched the shutter tens of times today.
    </p>
    <p>I've gotten the hang of it by now.
    </p>
    <p>Haruka, looking down, looked at me once and took a big breath.
    </p>
    <p>Then, holding a pitcher of water with a slice of lemon in it, she left the waiting room and started
        walking around the store.
    </p>
    <p>While introducing herself to everyone one by one, she courteously lowered her head.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it wasn't very smooth, and it was clear that she lacked practice compared to the other
        maids.
    </p>
    <p>However, because of this, she ended up actually receiving the warm looks of the adults.
    </p>
    <p>Haruka had a charming face as a woman, and those who looked at her, without seeing her inner
        face, unconsciously had favourable impressions of her.
    </p>
    <p>"Facing victory or defeat, it seems that our class can finally be relieved, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>"Indeed."
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun. Hasebe-san just got a request for three photos. Please take care of it!"
    </p>
    <p>Satou's voice reached the waiting room, and I prepared my camera right away.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita also seems to have the resolve to do her final duties in the time left until her break.
    </p>
    <p>"See you later."
    </p>
    <p>After Horikita left the waiting room, I looked at the board inside the room.
    </p>
    <p>It's made in a way that lets you understand who got the most photo requests at a quick glance,
    </p>
    <p>but, Kushida, who had increased her photoshoot numbers while I wasn't here, was first with 56
        photos. Satou was second with 24 photos, so Kushida was clearly the first with an
        overwhelming difference.
    </p>
    <p>By the way, Horikita, not being very amicable, only has 11 photoshoots.
    </p>
    <p>If it's just about outer looks, she wouldn't lose to Kushida, but, it seems that isn't the most
        important thing.
    </p>
    <p>Having some charm and courtesy seems to be the most important thing.
    </p>
    <p>"Even if Haruka tries her hardest to make a comeback now, I don't think she can go past this
        record, after all."
    </p>
    <p>Even as I was standing in front of Haruka with the camera in my hand, I can hear the new
        orders to take a photo with Kushida coming from the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>"Alright, Haruka. I'm taking it."
    </p>
    <p>"...Ri, right."
    </p>
    <p>She is still a bit resistant to face me, so her expression is stiff.
    </p>
    <p>I'm aiming for the best moment to come in front of the lens, but…
        "Should I change with Yousuke?"
    </p>
    <p>"Wait. I'm okay... Yep, I'm okay."
    </p>
    <p>She whispered so many times as if talking to herself, and raised her hand.
    </p>
    <p>It wasn't a full on smile, but she was expressive enough for a photo, so I clicked the shutter.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image9.webp" alt="">
    <p>The first photo is alone. The other two are two-shots together with the customers.</p>
    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        Around the time when 3:00 PM is finally closing in.
    </p>
    <p>For the sake of making my last move, I put the maid cafe behind me to make the arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>Nobody knows how much you have to earn to get first place.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it's possible to take the first place for sure if you get over half the private points that
        are circulating, but it's pretty much impossible to arrange this.
    </p>
    <p>In summary, until the moment when the Cultural Festival is over, the most important thing is to
        earn as much as you can.
    </p>
    <p>Both the Horikita class and the Ryuen class earned high praise with their student concept cafes.
    </p>
    <p>The one on one composition is popular with the many visitors, and, encourages them to
        cooperate with one, or both of the classes to help them in their struggle.
    </p>
    <p>In this situation that can be thought of as a deadlock in this struggle for supremacy, it was when
        I came to see the look of the Japanese concept cafe to know our opponents' feelings that new
        change happened. The customers who created the long line are impatiently waiting to enter the
        restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>"I see that this place is no less successful."
    </p>
    <p>Thriving more than expected, the Ryuen Class' students have no free time to chat.
    </p>
    <p>I can't make a complete judgement by seeing just this moment, but I'm sure that there's not a
        big difference in the amount of points they're earning.
    </p>
    <p>It looks very much like they're aiming for first place, but there's no definite proof that they will
        reach it.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry to have troubled you by calling you here, Chabashira-Sensei."
    </p>
    <p>I called Chabashira Sensei, who is probably using her points for the classes outside the Year
        Two classes.
    </p>
    <p>"Did you use up all of your private points?"
    </p>
    <p>"Hm? Right, I have 80 points left. I told you I used them all, didn't I? What about it?"
    </p>
    <p>Time is of the essence, so it seems that, as a proper teacher, she already finished contributing
        to the Cultural Festival.
    </p>
    <p>"In summary, I could say that you have some free time now, correct?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. All that's left for me to do is to wait until the Cultural Festival is over, but... Just
        what is this about?"
    </p>
    <p>Not understanding why she was called here, she showed me an appearance that looked very
        worried.
    </p>
    <p>The Japanese style cafe is only the background. I'm not going to say that it's prospering, or that
        there is a possibility the Horikita class might lose.
    </p>
    <p>It's enough if Chabashira Sensei personally sees the way this course of events is going and
        interprets them on her own.
    </p>
    <p>"Actually, I wanted to ask for your cooperation for the next hour."
    </p>
    <p>"Stop there, Ayanokoji. Cooperation? I don't understand what you mean, but..."
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : The words used in Chabashira-sensei’s dialogue implies that she is very much
        uncomfortable and nervous with Ayanokoji only asking for cooperation ( Without even him giving
        any details ) ]
    </p>
    <p>The teachers spend their points inside the school and contribute to the Cultural Festival.
    </p>
    <p>Today, she is only given that duty, at least.
    </p>
    <p>"For the sake of increasing our sales in the maid cafe, I want you to become a maid."
    </p>
    <p>I put into words the strategy I had in mind to solidify my victory, but…
        "...Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>This may be the first time I'm hearing such a dumbfounded voice from her.
    </p>
    <p>"You want me to be a maid? I've never heard something like that before... What are you
        saying?"
    </p>
    <p>"Like I said just now. I'm just making the moves I can for the sake of winning."
    </p>
    <p>"Why is it necessary for me to become a maid? I'm a teacher in the first place. Furthermore, I'm
        also the homeroom teacher of the class. I won't be allowed to side myself with a specific class."
    </p>
    <p>"That's not true, is it? With the rules right now, the school's teachers get treated the same as
        guests. Classroom Teachers can't use their points in their own year. These two rules don't apply
        here. There is also no rule that says only students can participate in the program. In the end,
    </p>
    <p>you should be free to serve guests. This isn't very usual, but if you say that it's alright, it's not a
        problem."
    </p>
    <p>With these rules, this act won't fall under what is not allowed.
    </p>
    <p>However, it would be a clear violation if it was an act of purchasing products outside the
        Conveinience Stores, Keyaki Mall, or even the Cultural Festival using her own personal funds
        instead of her points.
    </p>
    <p>[ TL Note : In japanese it literally says ‘Hurried/Sudden Conveinience Store’ instead of only
        Conveinience Stores. I don’t know if that’s a specific type of store or a real world reference of
        stores. So, I decided to use only Conveinience Store. Just wanted to let you know. ]
    </p>
    <p>However, I am free to view her as "Human Resources" without these rules applying.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps because she could not make sense of these things, Chabashira Sensei was
        completely silent.
    </p>
    <p>"Shall I explain it in an easier way? There is a student carrying a heavy baggage and his legs
        are shaking. A visitor passing by helped him carry it until his destination. Is this a violation?"
    </p>
    <p>"...It's not a violation."
    </p>
    <p>"That's right. This would be valid for students, too. The Year Two A Class asks the Year Two D
        Class for cooperation, and the D Class agrees. Is there a problem with loaning students out?"
    </p>
    <p>There may be all kinds of reasons to loan someone out. Simply for the sake of helping with pure
        intent.
    </p>
    <p>As a strategy to cause problems on the inside, or, expecting them to return the favour and
        exchanging labour.
    </p>
    <p>No matter what the reason may be, if it is inside the rules, the school won't criticize such things.
    </p>
    <p>In truth, even just by walking around the school, the figures of students supporting other classes
        can be seen here and there.
    </p>
    <p>"There is... No problem, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>"This is the same as that. It isn't against the rules for you to answer my request for aid."
    </p>
    <p>"No, I can't. I would still look like I'm lending aid to the class that I'm in charge of."
    </p>
    <p>"That's true. Even if it is generally allowed, there will still be people who hold such an opinion
        like that."
    </p>
    <p>This is precisely why I have to make use of the clear rules and make this legitimate.
    </p>
    <p>"I will pay the private points that will be generated when I receive your aid. Looking over at this
        Cultural Festival, I'm sure the school has this possibility in its field of view."
    </p>
    <p>"That's not... No, but... You've thought of everything..."
    </p>
    <p>I've struck the bulls-eye. She is showing me such an expression.
    </p>
    <p>Chabashira Sensei is a teacher of this school too, and, she has been in charge of a different
        class in the past, too.
    </p>
    <p>For the Cultural Festival that has no practical examples from the past, the school must have all
        kinds of hypotheses.
    </p>
    <p>As a general rule, private points are a strong weapon in this school.
    </p>
    <p>They can be used not just for daily shopping, but also to secure personnel as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>"There is nothing in this school that can't be bought with private points. Is that wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>Denying this would be denying the school.
    </p>
    <p>Further, it would be like admitting failure as a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>Even if her true intent is different, Chabashira Sensei has no right to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>She hurriedly started reading through the rules relating to the Cultural Festival on her phone.
    </p>
    <p>"...In the case of receiving the help of a teacher, 100 thousand private points will be paid for one
        hour."
    </p>
    <p>"I can see from your Strategy that you use well, the secret rules that the school alone holds."
    </p>
    <p>This is the same as back when I bought points for a test with my private points.
    </p>
    <p>"It's 100 thousand points for one hour, you know. That's not a cheap condition, but... Are you
        sure?"
    </p>
    <p>"Of course."
    </p>
    <p>Even if I do get her aid, I won't give her a big duty.
    </p>
    <p>Even if I can make her cook, even if I can make her serve, without practice, it's a waste of my
        private points to make her my ally for 1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>If she went out to serve customers in the cafe, it would be hard to succeed without practice in
        the actual event.
    </p>
    <p>However, if I can make use of her in a way that differs from regular duties, it would be worth
        spending a lot of private points.
    </p>
    <p>"You're really, really sure, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"You're repeating yourself, Chabashira Sensei. Time is of the essence right now, so I'll have
        your cooperation even if you don't like it."
    </p>
    <p>If it gets past 3:00 PM, I will not be able to fully receive her help and have it be worth the private
        points.
    </p>
    <p>"Wa-... Wait. That's right, how about you ask Chie? She'll be better at this kind of thing. Even if
        she is from a rival class, I think she will fulfill her duty as a teacher."
    </p>
    <p>"I suppose so. However, what I am looking for right now is not skilled personnel, but the reverse.
    </p>
    <p>I think I will get more effective results the more unskilled you are and the more unrelated you are
        to this field of work."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't understand... I don't understand your reasoning at all."
    </p>
    <p>It is true that, from the depths of her heart, she does not like or understand this.
    </p>
    <p>Precisely because she does not understand, she will function as I imagine.
    </p>
    <p>"We don't have any more time. Thank you for working with me."
    </p>
    <p>I forced her to hold my phone and paid the private points to Chabashira Sensei.
    </p>
    <p>"With this, the contract is complete."
    </p>
    <p>"That's... That's sneaky, Ayanokoji. Using the school's rules and such."
    </p>
    <p>This isn't sneaky, or anything else, I think that it is the perfect method of fighting, but...
    </p>
    <p>"I don't have a clue about how to work in a maid cafe. I don't know how this will go, so."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not worried. I don't expect anything from you."
    </p>
    <p>Chabashira Sensei, in the classroom wearing a maid outfit.
    </p>
    <p>This reality alone will allow me to win.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        I pushed the displeased Chabashira Sensei into the changing room, then I pasted into my
        phone the text that I had prepared beforehand, and used it to communicate with my
        class-mates.
    </p>
    <p>I conveyed the fact that Chabashira Sensei was going to work as a maid in the last one hour, for
        the sake of notifying the free students to go around inside the school announcing this.
    </p>
    <p>As I aimed for, this subject spread quickly and far with word of mouth.
    </p>
    <p>Using a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>A grand, special event that is impossible for students to realize.
    </p>
    <p>I understood that this would cause a big enough uproar to instantly change the atmosphere in
        the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>Chabashra Sensei, slightly sprinting with a rush, reached me with her face all red.
    </p>
    <p>"Here... Here I am, Ayanokoji. Quickly, let me into the classroom!"
    </p>
    <p>"I've been waiting for you."
    </p>
    <p>I can't just let her go by herself, so I took her into the classroom and guided her around.
    </p>
    <p>"So, what am I to do here...?"
    </p>
    <p>"You don't have to do anything. Please just keep standing here."
    </p>
    <p>"Wh-... What?"
    </p>
    <p>"Didn't I say already? That I don't want you to do this skillfully. Thank you for the help."
    </p>
    <p>I threw Chabashira Sensei into the classroom like this, and gave her the work of just standing
        around.
    </p>
    <p>Without speaking with anyone, and simply standing in the corner of the classroom with
        embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>Even if she looks for aid from someone, nobody will help her, no... I'll make sure that nobody will
        help her.
    </p>
    <p>[TL Note : It’s implied that he wants Chabashira-sensei to be in a vulnerable state to draw more
        attention to her. ]
    </p>
    <p>Now this is the ultimate eroticism.
    </p>
    <p>From this moment on, I have to change the maid cafe's policies.
    </p>
    <p>My biggest grounds for concern is the possibility of there being too many customers to fit into
        the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>In order to solve this physical problem, it is necessary to grant the customers fitting
        compensation.
    </p>
    <p>That is to set up a "Observing Admission Fee", and accept the customers that surpass our
        capacity.
    </p>
    <p>I will add a rule that one may enter the classroom right away if they pay 1000 points.
    </p>
    <p>I will make the proposal to the waiting customers that they may enter the classroom to stand
        and observe, and, if they accept, allow them to get to the front of the line to enter the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the customers in the front of the line may be unsatisfied, but I have the resolve to take
        this risk.
    </p>
    <p>"Standing and observing... I've never heard of such an idea in a maid cafe."
    </p>
    <p>"It's like a second space."
    </p>
    <p>We will use the side of the teacher's podium where we cannot set up tables and the empty
        space in the back as the observing spaces.
    </p>
    <p>With this, it is possible to enter the room even without enough tables and seats.
    </p>
    <p>Then, to take a photo with Chabashira Sensei, 2000 points.
    </p>
    <p>It will cost many times more than the photos that students take alone.
    </p>
    <p>I rushed towards the board at the entrance and wrote these in.
    </p>
    <p>"Wow... Will customers really come in with that price..?"
    </p>
    <p>"Look behind you."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida turned around from looking at me as I was writing on the board, and saw the customers
        who finished paying for the observer fee being sucked into the classroom and disappearing.
    </p>
    <p>The active faculty and the staff are also very curious about this sight that is sure to be never
        seen again.
    </p>
    <p>Although there are restrictions in place that the teachers in the same year cannot drop private
        points, the number of teachers who are in charge of years other than Year 2 are naturally much
        larger.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, even the adults who work at Keyaki Mall have an image of Chabashira Sensei as a
        regular straight-laced type of person who they would see many times a day.
    </p>
    <p>Adults, adults, and more adults, coming in like waves.
    </p>
    <p>"Somehow, it feels like our hard work is being overshadowed... I feel a bit down about this."
    </p>
    <p>Some of the adults coming in from the outside don't understand the meaning of this
        phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>However, in the case of a thought such as "there's no harm in just taking a look", it's different.
    </p>
    <p>Baited by the words "I don't really get it, but I should take a look anyway", they are being caught
        in the momentum.
    </p>
    <p>The maid cafe is overflowing with standing observers, surpassing 10 people, then 20.
    </p>
    <p>Let alone diminish, the line is gaining more and more momentum.
    </p>
    <p>"There's... There's so many people, huh, Ayanokoji-kun."
    </p>
    <p>The dumbfounded Kushida is taken aback by the crowd of adults pushing in.
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. Honestly, I didn't think there would be this many, either."
    </p>
    <p>"When did you come up with such an absurd plan?"
    </p>
    <p>"It was about two weeks ago. I came up with it as the ace up my sleeve for the Cultural
        Festival."
    </p>
    <p>"I wonder how it would have gone if we had started from an earlier hour…?"
    </p>
    <p>"This really may have a sustainable effect for two or three hours. It's just that, this raises a
        different problem. In the case that there is a surplus of time, different classes can do something
        like this too."
    </p>
    <p>"Ah, right. There isn't even an hour left, so they couldn't copy us even if they wanted to."
    </p>
    <p>If every class put a teacher out to perform, the effect would end up diminished.
    </p>
    <p>"There is only this one last hour to have this premium feel."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida and others spreading the maid cafe’s reputation around in a good way also bore great
        results.
    </p>
    <p>"...I see. That’s why I couldn’t win."
    </p>
    <p>"Hm?"
    </p>
    <p>"I've realized your strength once again, Ayanokoji-kun. It would be a lot of trouble to make an
        enemy out of you."
    </p>
    <p>"Your eyes aren't laughing, Kushida."
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe it's because I'm half glad to be your classmate, but also half irritated by you."
    </p>
    <p>He said half, but I feel like the latter is higher.
    </p>
    <p>"Please don't push! Line up here! Please don't push!"
    </p>
    <p>Sudou and the others hurriedly created a human wall and tried to form a queue, but there are
        adults who are trying everything they can to see inside of the class-room, so it's becoming quite
        the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>But, this is part of business, too. With everything inside hidden, and because of the fact that the
        windows are locked, the only way to forcefully see inside is to break the windows.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, there are no adults who would do such a thing, so, we'll force them to get in a line.
    </p>
    <p>As we did so, requests for photographs with Chabashira Sensei continued without stopping.
    </p>
    <p>The customers who came in to observe standing, and the customers who were in before that
        too are asking for photographs one after another.
    </p>
    <p>"In this one hour, she might climb up to the top of the personal sales chart... Even though she's
        not doing anything."
    </p>
    <p>"We can't let any more people in, after all!"
    </p>
    <p>Mii-chan's voice, sounding like a cry for help, reached me, and let me know that the second
        space is filled.
    </p>
    <p>"This is it, isn't it? The customers aren't decreasing at all yet, and they don't seem to want to
        leave, so it's a shame, but..."
    </p>
    <p>Kushida is saying that perhaps we should be satisfied with just letting in customers to stand and
        observe.
    </p>
    <p>"Not yet. The customers who are still here are lining up because they have money. I have no
        intent of letting them leave."
    </p>
    <p>"But... Wait, are you going to put in new tables? But you need cutlery for the tables too, so
        there's no way... It would take time to carry them here as well."
    </p>
    <p>It is obvious that there is no longer any space inside the classroom to let customers in.
    </p>
    <p>"I will start using the third space now."
    </p>
    <p>"Third... Space?"
    </p>
    <p>I faced all the customers waiting in line, and raised my voice:
    </p>
    <p>"I apologize sincerely, but the cafe is completely full inside, so we cannot allow anyone else to
        enter the room."
    </p>
    <p>After I announced so, the unsatisfied glares of the adults turned on me one after another.
    </p>
    <p>"However, as a special offer, those who have more than 1 points currently may pay everything
        they have and look inside the room from this place.
    </p>
    <p>This place, as in the corridor, is fitting to make a row shaped maid cafe.
    </p>
    <p>I will remove the obstructions by opening the doors, and somehow widen the room by opening
        the windows.
    </p>
    <p>"You'll... You'll use the corridor!?"
    </p>
    <p>"That's right."
    </p>
    <p>"But, you're asking them to pay everything... Maybe the ones that don't have much will do it, but
        will the people who have a lot of points pay them all?"
    </p>
    <p>It seems that she doesn't think there are many who will pay everything even if it's for Chabashira
        Sensei.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not a problem. I don't know if this is worth paying a big amount for or not, but, there's
        already very little time left. Even if they have 10,000 points to spend, where they can actually
        spend it is a big question."
    </p>
    <p>"Ah, right... When the Cultural Festival is over, unspent points were going to be taken back by
        the school, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. Because it's set up to encourage people to spend it all. If they're not going to be able to
        spend the points anywhere else, they can just spend them all here. It wouldn't be an
        exaggeration to say that whether it's 1 point or 10,000 points, it's all the same for the adults who
        were granted points."
    </p>
    <p>Actually, the more they have, the more they'll want to use them up here.
    </p>
    <p>Further, the adults who have been made to wait until now are sure to have a lot of points.
    </p>
    <p>"I'll check the sequential bill, so please wait there a bit."
    </p>
    <p>After I gave out the instructions, several people went out to collect the sales.
    </p>
    <p>Then, the adults were lined up in the corridor, and they were guided into the positions where
        they will be able to see inside the class.
    </p>
    <p>"After that, just open the curtains that have been hiding the room until now."
    </p>
    <p>With this, the third space will be complete.
    </p>
    <p>The curtains, opening at once, and Chabashira Sensei, being surprised by this.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 7/images/image8.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        For Chabashira Sensei, this is a bit of a public punishment, but the school is being paid for it, so
        there's no reason to think this is a bad thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey hey, I get it, this is..."
    </p>
    <p>The voices of the teachers talking about Chabashira Sensei could be heard just now.
    </p>
    <p>Someone from the opposite gender, standing alone, in a figure that they had never seen before,
    </p>
    <p>it must be very exciting.
    </p>
    <p>With this, until 4:00 PM, Chabashira Sensei was on display from the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>In the end, Chabashira Sensei took 63 photographs requests, and took first place, surpassing
        Kushida.
