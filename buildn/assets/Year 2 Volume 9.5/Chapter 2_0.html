    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h2>A Small Prenominiton</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
I put my arms through the sleeves of my private clothes I have never worn since buying, and poured warm water into a cup. 

</p><p>Noticing the light coming through the window, I opened the curtains.

</p><p>“There’s so much piled up…”

</p><p>The rain that was coming down until last night had suddenly turned into snow, which continued all night.

</p><p>It seems to have stopped for now during the day-time, but there’s apparently going to be a blizzard tonight. 

</p><p>The television also says that the snow is going to continue for a few days.

</p><p>“It’s no wonder it feels so cold here.”

</p><p>This is the genuine arrival of the season when hot coffee becomes tastier.

</p><p>I stood before the kitchen with my new cup of coffee in my right hand, and my phone in my left hand, looking at goods and prices. 

</p><p>I didn’t know this until recently, but it looks like Keyaki Mall has web advertisements targeting those who live in this school. 

</p><p>I suddenly learned this fact just last night.

</p><p>I noticed it after the class group chat got lively last night when people were talking about what they would do on Christmas Eve, or what they were doing.

</p><p>At first, the group chat’s main subject was Ike and Shinohara.

</p><p>They’re in the group chat, but neither of them read any messages after 9 p.m., which really got their classmates talking. 

</p><p>Coincidence, or were they together?

</p><p>Of course, I’m sure most people thought that it was the latter.

</p><p>There were wild ones among them who made phone calls with half jealousy and half banter, but neither of them had their phones on.

</p><p>They didn’t see it as a coincidence, however, and the chat log continued. 

</p><p>The subject remained the same for a long time, and I was impressed that they didn’t run out of things to talk about for hours and hours.

</p><p>Then, a large sale caught my attention.

</p><p>“Wow… Consumer electronics are pretty cheap too.”

</p><p>I carefully took a sip from my coffee so as to not get burned and slid the screen with my finger.

</p><p>Starting with goods popular with boys such as gaming machines, gaming software and such, there are also daily necessities such as driers or electric toothbrushes. 

</p><p>The categories even extend to cookware like mixers or slicers. 

</p><p>I’ve been cooking more frequently recently, so I’m curious about a few of these things.

</p><p>A yogurt maker somehow caught my attention, and it’s even on a limited sale according to the web advertisement.

</p><p>I think it’s a simple enough decision to buy this.

</p><p>I should keep my private point spending in check, but I can recoup it by utilizing the yogurt maker in the future.

</p><p>It’s just that I don’t know how much yogurt I’m going to eat in the rest of my school life, and if it’s going to be cheaper than store-bought yogurt… 

No, that’s a futile thought.

</p><p>I just want this yogurt maker, and I want to use it.

</p><p>That’s probably all there is to it.

</p><p>If I only consider cost-effectiveness, it is obvious that I would have to choose not to buy it. 

</p><p>The more I think about it, the less likely I am to buy a yogurt maker. 

</p><p>So, I stopped thinking about it.

</p><p>They’re selling it at a special price, so I’m going to buy it. 

</p><p>That’s all it is.

</p><p>Other than that, I’m curious how the limited sale works.

</p><p>The main target group of Keyaki Mall is students, so they don’t have a system to keep a large amount of stock.

</p><p>It’s very possible that they only handle a few units at a time.

</p><p>Above all, this big sale seems to be popular among the students.

</p><p>I didn't care about it last year, but the sale somehow became popular without me knowing, and everything sold out without me knowing again. (as one can see from the class group chat).

</p><p>“Should I go check it out..?”

</p><p>I’m not sure about this kind of sale, to be honest, because I’ve never been to one before.

</p><p>Should I experience it, or wait and see?

</p><p>As I was wondering that, I received a message on my phone.

</p><p>“Good morning. Can I call you later? Will that be a nuisance?”

</p><p>The message was from Ichinose, whom I met at the gym yesterday. 

</p><p>She was probably trying to be discreet, considering the possibility that Kei might be with me, even if she isn't feeling well.

</p><p>No, maybe not. 

</p><p>Ichinose already knows that Kei has influenza. 

</p><p>She wouldn’t think that Kei would be completely recovered after yesterday.

</p><p>I guess it’s just for appearances sake.

</p><p>I decided to make the call, partly to let her know that there was no problem.

</p><p>“Good morning. Are you okay?”

</p><p>“Yeah. Is something wrong?”

</p><p>“Err, what are your plans for the day today?”

</p><p>“My plans? Well, nothing particular.”

</p><p>“Karuizawa-san still hasn't recovered, has she?”

</p><p>“She has influenza, so I think it’s going to take a little longer.”

</p><p>“I see… I’d like to visit her, but the school issued a warning, didn’t they?” 

</p><p>“Looks like it. We’re not supposed to come in contact with her.” 

</p><p>The school sent an email to students and staff telling them to avoid careless visits or going outside in spite of having influenza.

</p><p>“I’m still checking up on her.”

</p><p>“I see, I’m glad to hear that.”

</p><p>She seems genuinely relieved, and not just on a surface level.

</p><p>“I’m sorry to bother you at a difficult time like this, but… Do you have any plans to go to Keyaki Mall today?” 

</p><p>“Hmm… Well, I was thinking of going out later, but… Should we decide on a time and meet there if you want to talk about something?”

</p><p>“No, we can’t. It may sound like a sophism, but this isn’t an appointment. I just wanted to know if you would be at the mall today.” 

</p><p>“I’ll probably go. Can I answer like that, then?” 

</p><p>“Yes, that’s good enough. Thank you.”

</p><p>Ichinose added something else after saying that.

</p><p>“Tell me if you have any problems. I want to help Karuizawa-san too.” 

</p><p>The phone call ended right away after that, and I never found out what Ichinose wanted. 

</p><p>Leaving that aside, I looked at the time and made my decision.

</p><p>“Alright.”

</p><p>The time is 9:45 a.m.

</p><p>Just in time to leave the dormitory for the opening of Keyaki Mall.

</p><p>I’m curious what Ichinose has to say, so I’m going to take the plunge.

</p><p>I’m going to enter the facility in the shortest way and head for the electronics store.

</p><p>Then, I’m going to take the yogurt maker into my hands and ignore any unnecessary items.

</p><p>I’d only be dancing under the mass merchandiser’s manipulation if I start buying this and that. 

</p><p>I put the coffee cup I just finished drinking from on the sink, and headed for the front door. 

</p><p>Let the mission begin.
