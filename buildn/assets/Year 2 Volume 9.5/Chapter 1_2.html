    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        Right after leaving the gym, I started thinking about my plans for later.
    </p>
    <p>I should take the item from the shop I planned on going by, then take a stroll in
        Keyaki Mall and go home.
    </p>
    <p>As for Mashima-sensei’s request, I can take it slow, like the person in question
        himself said.
    </p>
    <p>I hope that he solves it himself while I think about how to extract information.
    </p>
    <p>It’s still just past noon.
    </p>
    <p>I’ll have too much time on my hands if I go back to my room now.
    </p>
    <p>I took out my phone and opened my address book.
    </p>
    <p>It wouldn’t be a bad idea to hang out with some male friends once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>“...Nothing.”</p>
    <p>
        I gently turned my phone’s screen off after taking a quick look.
    </p>
    <p>I can’t remember many times when I spontaneously called a friend of the
        same gender and hung out.
    </p>
    <p>“Wanna hang out a bit later if you’re free?”</p>
    <p>
        When I say that…</p>
    <p>
        “I’m busy.”</p>
    <p>
        …and decisively get rejected like that, it feels extremely shocking.
    </p>
    <p>Yousuke would infer how I feel and accept my invitation, but I don’t want him
        to worry about me.
    </p>
    <p>In short, it takes a lot of labour to invite someone, and it’s quite the big deal.
    </p>
    <p>In the end, I reached the conclusion that it’s best to be alone without troubling
        anyone.
    </p>
    <p>“What even are friends, I wonder?”</p>
    <p>
        I realize again that even though I’m entering the latter part of my second year
        here, I still don’t handle this subject very well.
    </p>
    <p>I went down to the first floor with an escalator.
    </p>
    <p>It’s still mid-day, so there are more students here now.
    </p>
    <p>There’s no other way than to talk to someone myself, is there?
    </p>
    <p>A chance meeting, for example.
    </p>
    <p>I should make it so that someone randomly finds me, and asks me to hang
        out.
    </p>
    <p>I looked around with that in mind, but I can’t find any classmates around at this
        time.
    </p>
    <p>As for same-year students…</p>
    <p>
        No, I don’t even see any of them.
    </p>
    <p>I would look too suspicious if I clumsily looked around to try and find someone.
    </p>
    <p>So, I quickly decided to give up on the route of meeting up with someone.
    </p>
    <p>I’ll change my objective for today to enjoy it by myself.
    </p>
    <p>I stopped before a map of the mall.
    </p>
    <p>I know where every shop is already, but I wanted to check if a new one
        opened.
    </p>
    <p>However, the shops don’t change much, and I don’t see anything new.
    </p>
    <p>There is one shop that grabs my attention, though.
    </p>
    <p>“I should check it out.”
        It was the rental shop, which I don’t usually visit that often.
    </p>
    <p>You can rent DVDs and BDs of videos, like movies or anime, whether they’re
        new or old.
    </p>
    <p>Other than that, they also have music discs.
    </p>
    <p>However, you can get permission from the school and pay a monthly fee to
        watch movie contents using a broadcasting service as you want, so this place
        isn’t very needed.
    </p>
    <p>This shop is utilized only by students who watch things occasionally, or
        students who are looking to find something specific.
    </p>
    <p>So, it's not a very popular place.
    </p>
    <p>That’s precisely why I decided to go there on this winter vacation.
    </p>
    <p>I have extra time, so it should be okay to do this once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>I feel like I’ve been lining up excuses for a while now, but I’m certainly not
        lonely.
    </p>
    <p>I should let myself know that again, just to make sure.
    </p>
    <p>After picking up the shop item I planned on taking, I reached the rental shop.
    </p>
    <p>It’s certainly not a big shop; I would rather say it’s cramped.
    </p>
    <p>All kinds of different discs are on display in this cramped space.
    </p>
    <p>They would normally be stored in a box or a case, but they’re in black or
        transparent OPP bags in this shop, with a printed paper glued to their
        backsides, where you can see what the item is.
    </p>
    <p>When using a computer or a tablet, one first checks the titles and the
        thumbnails to see if it’s interesting.
    </p>
    <p>When you’re checking everything in your hands one by one like this, you pick
        up things you never would have otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>Further, I read through the entire summary.
    </p>
    <p>While countless works are readily available, it's not a bad idea to search for
        good ones once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>I might start coming to the rental shop more often.
    </p>
    <p>But, there’s still one problem.
    </p>
    <p>Even if I do find something interesting, there’s no need to rent it here.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe if it’s something rare that isn’t on the internet, but otherwise I can just
        go back to my dorm and watch it as I want.
    </p>
    <p>I’m sure these rental shops are going to get even more difficult to operate in
        the future.
    </p>
    <p>It’s the same with electronics retail stores.
    </p>
    <p>I’ve heard that most people look at items in the store, then buy them cheaper
        online.
    </p>
    <p>I looked around the movie corner for a while, then went to the music corner.
    </p>
    <p>Normally, I’m not someone who listens to music that often.
    </p>
    <p>I hear the latest hits and the best songs of former years on TV, but that’s it.
    </p>
    <p>I have no experience purchasing music myself, and I still don’t have much
        interest in it.
    </p>
    <p>That’s why I’m exploring. I hope I can encounter something.
    </p>
    <p>I thought there was no one else in the rental shop, but it looks like there was
        one other customer.
    </p>
    <p>She has headphones on, and there’s BGM music in the store as well, so she
        doesn’t seem to have noticed me.
    </p>
    <p>I couldn’t tell who it was at first, but her details became clear when I
        approached closer.
    </p>
    <p>It was Shiranami Chihiro, who is based in the Ichinose Class.
    </p>
    <p>I haven’t talked much with her, but we’ve rarely encountered each other a few
        times at events.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, it was during the Uninhabited Island Test, and we also had contact
        on the ship afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>I wonder what she’s listening to?
    </p>
    <p>I’m curious, as I don’t know much about Japanese music (though it could be
        something else).
    </p>
    <p>But Shiranami is focused on listening to her music, so I don't think she will
        hear me if I talk to her too quietly.
    </p>
    <p>She’ll get startled if I forcefully enter her line of sight, however.
    </p>
    <p>I could have waited until the song was over, but there are going to be hurdles
        to talking to her and asking about it later, so I decided to get close and listen.
    </p>
    <p>While pretending to be looking around the store to not look suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>“Ah..!?”
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 9.5/Images/image1.webp" alt="">
    <p>
        Crap. I guess I startled her.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe I approached too closely since I’m curious about what she’s listening
        to.
    </p>
    <p>She hurriedly took her headphones off.
    </p>
    <p>“A-Ayanokoji-kun!?”</p>
    <p>
        “Sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.”</p>
    <p>
        Since she took them off, I can clearly hear the music coming from her
        headphones.
    </p>
    <p>I can hear a somewhat sorrowful guitar and a woman’s singing voice.
    </p>
    <p>“My broken heart, only time can heal. Someone else, other than him———”</p>
    <p>
        I guess it’s a song about being lovelorn.
    </p>
    <p>Then, she quickly turned the song off by pushing the stop button.
    </p>
    <p>“D-D-Do you need something!?”</p>
    <p>
        She asked, still a little surprised.
    </p>
    <p>“No… I don’t need anything, but I was just wondering what you were listening
        to. That’s all.”</p>
    <p>
        I replied honestly, but whether she will be convinced or not is another matter.
    </p>
    <p>I’m someone from another class with whom she is not close with, and
        someone whom she wouldn’t talk to if she didn’t meet with him by
        coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>Considering the differences between men and women as well, I might look
        very suspicious right now.
    </p>
    <p>“Sorry to bother you, I’ll take my leave.”</p>
    <p>
        I don’t want to pointlessly stay here and keep bothering her.
    </p>
    <p>The only thing I can do now is to quickly get away from her.
    </p>
    <p>“Err, umm…”</p>
    <p>
        She looks like she wants to say something.
    </p>
    <p>At the very least, she is not the type of person who can easily talk to those she
        is not familiar with.
    </p>
    <p>Still, if I try to urge her to speak, it will only have the opposite effect.
    </p>
    <p>So I didn’t look at her, and instead averted my gaze to another spot.
    </p>
    <p>I’m going to create an environment where she can speak comfortably and wait
        for her.
    </p>
    <p>“Umm… Do you have… some time now..?”</p>
    <p>
        A surprising extension request from Shiranami.
    </p>
    <p>“Sure, but can we really chat here?”</p>
    <p>
        From what I can see, this isn’t going to be about music.
    </p>
    <p>If we start chatting about unrelated things here in a rental shop without
        spending money either, then we’re going to be unwelcome guests.
    </p>
    <p>“Right… I’m fine with anywhere, and I don’t think it’s going to take that much
        time, so…”</p>
    <p>
        “Then…”</p>
    <p>
        “Ah, but, I don’t want to draw any attention, I think. I don’t want anyone to
        misunderstand…”</p>
    <p>
        I was about to ask to go to a cafe, but that’s out of the question now.
    </p>
    <p>“What shall we do, then? We can go wherever you’d like.”</p>
    <p>
        “...I’ll leave it up to you.”</p>
    <p>
        She’s entrusting it to me, with certain limitations.
    </p>
    <p>This does feel a little unusual, but I made contact in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>I should think of a spot that meets her demands.
    </p>
