    <p class="c2 c12"><span class="c35"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As November was coming to a close, the awaited day of the school trip finally
            approached.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">On the road to school on a sunny but chilly morning, I see three a small group of
            three walking ahead of me with Haruka in the middle. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There is no specific loud laughter occuring, but it seemed like they were making up
            some topics to fill in the gaps.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to call out to them?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Kei said so while walking by my side.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. This is what I decided back when Airi was
            expelled.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">For that group, I am now an unnecessary presence. Rather, I have to be so.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t say anything again. Because I know that it&rsquo;s the
            correct answer if you&rsquo;re fine with it, Kiyotaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">For Kei, who thinks this is all other people&rsquo;s business, I&rsquo;m sure that
            the former Ayanokoji group&rsquo;s affairs aren&rsquo;t something to deeply care about.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And? That means I can have you all to myself, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">She faced me with a sincere smile from the heart.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s no suspicion about the fact that I have become a pillar of
            psychological support for Kei after all this time.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m super looking forward to the next school trip, you know! Where do
            you think it&rsquo;ll be?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not giving up on my dream of Kyoto.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, right, you said something about that. If it&rsquo;s not Kyoto, I&rsquo;m
            fine with any place.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">For some reason, my aspiration Kyoto is the only thing immediately excluded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Do you hate Kyoto that much?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Huh? Come on, it&rsquo;s all about the temples and the cultural properties. It
            doesn&rsquo;t seem fun at all, does it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I think that precisely is one of the true charms of it, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It is true that for Kei, visiting temples and shrines may not be so fun.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on my mind right now is exactly that, you know. Yep,
            yep.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The location of the trip is important too, but don&rsquo;t you care about the
            results of the end of term test?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My grade won&rsquo;t increase if I start caring about it now, will it? Well, I
            do feel like I did quite well for myself, so. That&rsquo;s also thanks to you, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There is a small problem with that overconfidence, but it is also the reality.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Although she can&rsquo;t expect high scores, it is true that the bottom level for Kei
            is getting higher.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It is only a vague declaration but doing some self-grading I can truly feel her
            growth.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Maybe I should increase my study time with you more too, like
            Sudou-kun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">She muttered so with the tip of her index finger on her lips.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t understand that her academic ability won&rsquo;t improve
            like Sudou&rsquo;s simply by studying for the same amount of time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The motivation of the person in question is very important, but, in the same way, the
            skill of the teaching side is also important.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Sudo&rsquo;s remarkable growth is certainly the result of Horikita&rsquo;s
            educational talent.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">That&rsquo;s the part about her that gives her the edge over Keisei.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">My education does not stand on such a foundation.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s simple to forcibly raise Kei&rsquo;s academic ability by giving her a
            thorough education, but that&rsquo;s not my duty. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">That part has to be left to someone else from among the class.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I should only do the bare minimum. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I simply have to get them to start studying on their own.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">So that one day, the fitting student can take over.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14 c12" id="h.tyjcwt"><span>Part 1</span></h3>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c35"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Today, two hours in the morning were set aside for a school trip. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Normal schools probably learn of things like this earlier, but for the students in
            this school, the end of term test before that is more important, so. First, they have to know its
            results.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It would be like a bad joke to learn you&rsquo;re getting expelled after being told
            about the plans for the school trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Very well then, I shall announce the results of the second term&rsquo;s end of
            term tests.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">A stinging atmosphere. Anxiety and unease. However, there are currently no students
            in despair.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Last year, around this time, a special test of this school called &lsquo;paper
            shuffle&#39; was put into practice.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Kushida&rsquo;s scheme, Ryuen&rsquo;s Influence. Horikita&rsquo;s characteristic
            strategy was strong, but this year is different.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The rules and the standards say that if you challenge the test created by the school
            and get a definitive failing mark, you get expelled. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It also becomes a fight on the class side, with first place getting 50 class points
            and second place getting 25 points. Third place gets minus 25 class points, and fourth place gets minus 50
            class points. It may be said that it is a pure scramble for class points.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The failing mark is 39 points average from all of the subjects. After close
            examination, it wasn&rsquo;t hard to avoid expulsion if you earnestly received your classes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The end of term test. First, I will start announcing from the lower ranking
            students.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Without any appearance of leeway, Chabashira-sensei had a stiff expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">That may appear to be inciting the students, but I think a certain amount of tension
            is necessary.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;First, it&rsquo;s the student who got the lowest ranking&hellip;&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The lowest grade, which is seen as more important than the highest.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;With 53 points as your average mark, it&rsquo;s you, Hondou.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Whoah!? Me!? Ah, but 53 points isn&rsquo;t that bad, right!? Wait, should I be
            happy!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">He yelled out with the mixed feelings of the joy of not getting a failing mark and
            the reality of having the lowest ranking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">He was always at the bottom group, so I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t the first time
            that Hondou has gotten the lowest ranking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After that, the grades were gradually announced from bottom to top, and after a while
            they started calling the names of the higher ranking students.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I can clearly say that the bottom group&rsquo;s rise is becoming reality.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">My girlfriend Kei also got better results than expected with 56 points.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The main cause of this is certainly the expulsion of Airi with the unanimous special
            exam.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After that exam, all the students below in OAA faced the danger of being thrown away,
            so they had to challenge the test with all of their might.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Even Kei who doesn&rsquo;t want to study except when it&rsquo;s with me is clearly
            starting to grow and improve.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">But, I have to quickly solve this problem. I&rsquo;ve really only taught her the
            minimum, so there is a risk that she will be separated from the other students because of the difference in
            potential. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I should ask someone to teach her, like Horikita who teaches after forming a proper
            plan, or Keisei, maybe even Yousuke.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The grades for all of the subjects, the total grades and the average grades are being
            shown on the monitor in turns as the names of the students are being called. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m 12th place. I&rsquo;m gradually and steadily moving up in the
            rankings.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Then, we finally got to the announcements of the class&rsquo; top 10.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">10th place is Sudou. I was a bit worried, but the results were similar to last time
            with him firmly breaking into the top rankings. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">His ranking moved up by one and he broke a new record for himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Then, finally, the first place was unexpectedly Horikita and Keisei with the same
            average mark of 93.5.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;About our rank among the other classes in this academic year&hellip; We passed
            Ichinose&rsquo;s Class average mark and got second place. Good Job.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">First place is the Sakayanagi A Class, second place is the Horikita B Class, third
            place is the Ichinose D Class, and fourth place is the Ryuen C Class.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">With this, our class points are 25+ in the total. However, Sakayanagi&rsquo;s Class A
            had good grades even among the lower ranked students, so we couldn&rsquo;t get first place this time either.
            It is small, but there ended up being a gap.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Well then, I know also from how hard you&rsquo;ve worked for the end of term
            test that you are all looking forward to the school trip. But, first, there is one thing I will do before
            the talks.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After saying so, an image was reflected on the monitor.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Following Chabashira-sensei&#39;s instruction, each student&rsquo;s tablet displayed
            a chart with familiar classmates&rsquo; names written on it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The front is the same as the monitor.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There are three items: Name, gender, and number, of which the name and gender are
            already filled.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As Chabashira-sensei said, all of the students in the class are written on it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Only the numbers are blank, which must mean that they will be filled in here and
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Most of it is easy to understand the moment you look at it, but it&rsquo;s unclear
            what the standard for the numbers are.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s limited to the range we can see from our seats, but there is not a single
            student who understands it either.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;On the screen are the students from the second year&rsquo;s B class, in other
            words, this class. You can see the empty space between the name and gender with small numbers written there,
            right? Starting from the first number, please fill in all 37 numbers from the class excluding yourself. You
            can&rsquo;t use the same number twice. First, type &ldquo;myself&rdquo; in an easy to read way on the space
            for your own number.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The 38 members of second year B class, excluding Yamauchi and Airi who have been
            expelled.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It seems that we&rsquo;re putting in numbers for all the students until number 37,
            excluding ourselves.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The problem is, what is the meaning of this number?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I can&rsquo;t randomly put in the numbers without thinking about it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Everyone used their tablets and put in the letters of their own name as
            instructed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After confirming that, Chabashira-sensei started explaining the numbers.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;About the meaning of the numbers that you&rsquo;re about to write down&hellip;
            You can see it as your assessment of the other party. You can simply put in number 1 because they&rsquo;re
            talented, because you&rsquo;re good friends with them, or because they&rsquo;re funny. The important thing
            is to use your own standards and give them a proper rating.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Basically, we&rsquo;re giving our classmates rankings, right?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">No&hellip; When I swiped the screen, I saw that it was not just our classmates, but
            the other three classes as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Some of you must have noticed already, but we&rsquo;re doing this ranking for
            all of the classes in year two. When it comes to the students from the other classes, there may be those
            with whom you haven&rsquo;t even spoken to, but you can just use your own standart again. I want you to put
            in numbers in an understandable scope.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Students rating students. We did something similar in the past, but you could say
            that this is still quite different from that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, just what are they making the students do something like this for?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Of course, the number you&rsquo;ve put in will not be revealed to the
            students. Even us class teachers will not know what kind of ratings you&rsquo;ve given, so please
            don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">So that means this is under the management of the school&rsquo;s upper
            management.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Further, it is prohibited to talk amongst yourselves or to look at the OAA
            while filling in the screen. Ignoring the parts you remember, it would be against the objective to put in
            numbers without your personal thoughts or conjecture.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It seems that it is also prohibited to mechanically put in numbers by relying on
            something else.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of girls here that I&rsquo;ve never talked to and I
            don&rsquo;t understand anything from the OAA either, so is this really okay..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Being different from the students who have a lot of personal connections, Hondou
            muttered so without confidence.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yeah. In the end, you can just write a random number for the people with whom
            you have no relation to. However, in order for the school to use this list for its objective, you will have
            responsibility no matter what the results will be.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Basically, it should be done according to a certain criteria, but, in the end, it
            will be left to the discretion of the individual filling it in. In exchange, she&rsquo;s saying that we
            shouldn&rsquo;t complain about the effect that this will have in the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">You may be able to grade each student properly in accordance to the relation
            you&rsquo;ve had with them up until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">You may regret it if you do it randomly, so do it earnestly. That&rsquo;s what
            she&rsquo;s saying.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You will finish this within the time limit of one hour from now. In the rare
            case that you don&rsquo;t finish it within the time limit, you will continue instead of receiving the
            explanation about the school trip, so do it carefully.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m sure no one thought that they would have to do something like this right
            before the school trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">While we were still confused, Chabashira-sensei instructed us to start right
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Everyone started without being able to make the preparations in their heads.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">But&hellip; General comments, huh?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As it will take the most amount of time, I left my own class for last, and decided to
            deal with the A class.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If it&rsquo;s about pure talent, I would support Sakayanagi, but this is about an
            overall assessment.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I can simply decide everything by if I like them as a person or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s up to the individual to put the person easiest to hang out with or the
            person they like most in first place.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">In any case, I should hold a clear standart and start filling in the numbers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I had intended on starting on the entries right away, but it&rsquo;s unexpectedly
            difficult.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The easy thing after all is to assess the talent that I can currently see
            myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I can just write by thinking about what I remember from the OAA if it&rsquo;s a
            student that I&rsquo;ve never crossed paths with.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After determining each tropism, I&rsquo;ll start from number 1.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It may be the same for a lot of students, but you could say that it&rsquo;s already
            decided to put Sakayanagi in number 1. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">With that, I took 20 minutes to finish writing down all of my assessments for each of
            the three classes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">What&rsquo;s left is the class I&rsquo;m a part of, the B class.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;ll include hidden potential, communication power and development.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There are some similarities to what was on the OAA, but my current number 1 is
            probably Yousuke.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s easy if you consider not only their general value but the contributions
            they&rsquo;ve made until today.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If it wasn&rsquo;t for Yousuke, there would be no competition in this class.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">For number 2, I chose Kouenji.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">His hidden potential, his achievements in the second year&#39;s Uninhabited Island
            exam, his unintended contributions in the sports festival, etc... He has brought in a lot of concrete
            benefits for the class. Even considering the quirky and uncooperative parts of his personality as a minus,
            this should be an appropriate rating.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The fact that we have established our current position as Class B is undoubtedly
            Kouenji&#39;s achievement.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I&#39;ll also give a good rating to Horikita, Keisei, Mii-chan and the others like
            them who study well and achieve good grades.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Then, with his physical and academic prowess that can&rsquo;t be underestimated, I
            put Sudou in number 9. If it&rsquo;s just the second years and above, I could say that he is valuable enough
            to be around number 3 or number 4 right after Kouenji.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I finished rating all of the students like this and raised my head up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It took around 40 minutes in total, but the students other than me still
            haven&rsquo;t&mdash;-..</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Just as I was thinking so, my eyes met with Chabashira-sensei who was observing the
            students and I noticed that Kouenji sitting next to me had finished before me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I can&rsquo;t be certain, but he probably filled it in randomly without thinking
            about all of the possibilities.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Without even looking at his tablet again, he was lightly blowing into his
            nails.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">In the case of these numbers being used for some kind of special exam other than to
            form groups, I can&rsquo;t imagine what kind of pattern it will be.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">For example, when the school takes a look at the results, there may be a special exam
            being conducted only with the students who were chosen to be in first and second place. In reverse, the
            students with low combined ability will be gathered and made to challenge a balanced task as a
            result.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, in that case, we would be told before to put in the numbers while thinking
            about the students&rsquo; talent and success, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have the students make the valuations
            in the first place. As a result of assigning numbers based on likes and dislikes, the risk of it being an
            unbalanced confrontation would be quite high.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c12 c14" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span>Part 2</span></h3>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c35"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">With a few minutes left until the planned time limit was over, Chabashira-sensei
            raised her voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Alright. Looks like everyone is finished, so I will consider the list&rsquo;s
            creation complete.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It seems like everyone finished the students&rsquo; evaluations without any issues
            within the time limit.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit faster than what I had imagined too, but let&rsquo;s start
            talking about the upcoming school trip.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Being released from the boring list creation, Ike and the others clapped.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Chabashira-sensei, who, unlike before, did not pay attention to Ike, started using
            her tablet.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">We&rsquo;ve been told that there is a school trip, but we still don&rsquo;t know the
            destination.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There were three choices in the unanimous special test.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Hokkaidou, Kyoto, Okinawa.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The location from among these three that gets the most votes from the students is to
            be chosen as the school trip&rsquo;s destination.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Incidentally, I&rsquo;m part of the minority faction that wants Kyoto, like Horikita,
            Keisei and the others.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The votes in this class ended up flowing towards Hokkaidou, but there should still be
            some hope.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If two classes from among the three classes vote for Kyoto, my wish will be
            granted.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">In the end, the result is&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;First, it&rsquo;s the results of the unanimous special exam
            earlier.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Chabashira-sensei, holding for a few seconds as if trying to make a dramatic
            pause.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The result of every class&rsquo; choice, having a total of three votes, the
            school trip&rsquo;s destination has been decided to be Hokkaidou.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As we heard the results, it was delight and disappointment, mixing together at the
            same time.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, the Horikita Class had voted for Hokkaidou, so it&rsquo;s safe to say that
            most of them are happy. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I see, so it&rsquo;s decided on Hokkaidou.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">From what I can see behind Horikita, she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
            disappointed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As for Keisei, he doesn&rsquo;t really seem dissatisfied in the slightest.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">In reverse, Sudou and the others who were in the Okinawa faction&hellip; Maybe
            they&rsquo;ve accepted this from the start, but they don&rsquo;t look like they care about this at
            all.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Sharing information between Classes shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed, but it&rsquo;s

            five day stay&rsquo;s schedule.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c39">School Trip Schedule:</span></p>
    <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c24">Day 1: Departing from school &gt; Haneda Airport &gt; Arrival at the ski spot &gt;

    <p class="c16"><span class="c24">Day 5: Way back</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It seems that we can move freely on the second day, and on the fourth day, with some
            conditions.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I was so worried, but it&rsquo;s all totally normal! No, better than normal!
            Freedom is the best!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Since this didn&rsquo;t seem to be inferior to the model cases compared to other
            schools, most of the students were happy and strangely cheerful because of such a normal school trip
            schedule.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It is true that it would be expected of this school to have a stranger

    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There is no special exam, so just what is going to be demanded from us?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;If you know yourself, and know your enemies, you will not fear a hundred
            battles. That&rsquo;s the theme of this school trip.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Huh? Wha-.. Huh? What did she say?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Hondou, not understanding &ldquo;Sun Tzu&rdquo;&rsquo;s quote about the art of war,
            tilted his neck.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You must know the circumstances of the foe you&rsquo;re fighting, and your own
            real strength. The meaning is that if you do this, you will never lose your battles.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Normally, it is the standart to form a few groups in the school trip and
            conduct ourselves according to that. It will be no different for you, but there is a point of clear
            difference compared to other schools.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Huh? Huuh? Huuuuh? Then, isn&rsquo;t it very likely that we might be together

    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The students who have been made merry by the yet unseen Hokkaidou were quickly pulled
            back to reality.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As if pointing that out, &nbsp;Chabashira-sensei started a brief explanation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Depending on your relationships and groups, almost
            everyone with you may be people you&rsquo;ll meet for the first time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I can&rsquo;t really say that I know a lot of people from the other classes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Depending on the number of people in the group, I can easily see things developing as
            Chabashira-sensei says.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;With a normal school, in the case of there being at most 160 students in a
            school year, there is a high possibility that one&rsquo;s circle of friends would be quite wide. However,
            the structure of this school becomes a hindrance and interferes with that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Of course, when you keep learning in the same environment for over a year, the number
            of friends you have increases.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It is not hard to see this school&rsquo;s structure interfering with that, especially
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;For you all, the most important thing is whether you can graduate in Class A
            or not. Basically, that&rsquo;s a battle of classes. That will not change in the future either. Because,
            &nbsp;naturally, you will see the other students as rivals more than you see them as friends.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">She&rsquo;s saying that such an environment is not fit to make friends in.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So, in your school lives during the day, the chances to learn of the real
            daily lives and actual circumstances of the students from other classes is naturally limited.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It is true that after spending more than a year together, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot
            about my classmates.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, there are many who don&rsquo;t know anything about the circumstances of
            other classes except on a superficial level.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Because there is also the fear that if one makes the mistake of showing their
            weaknesses, they will be taken advantage of.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">On an entirely different facet, there might even occur a hesitation to defeat
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">I want my friends from the other classes to graduate in Class A too.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If such a feeling comes up, one would be greatly confused while fighting.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There must be a lot of students who don&rsquo;t want to know anything on
            purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This school trip&rsquo;s objective is to clear away that hindrance. This is
            the best chance to know the other person, not as someone from a different class, but as a student of the
            same school, and as a fellow human.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">A four nights five days stay feels short, but it&rsquo;s long.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The more group activities there will be in that time period, the higher the
            possibility of the distance between students shrinking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, in reverse, there may be cases where the distance does not shrink at
            all.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Even if the school removes the hindrance, there is nothing to do if the students
            themselves build up walls.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hmm... This school trip is starting to seem really annoying, and I don&rsquo;t
            feel like I&rsquo;ll enjoy it at all!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">They know that the rules decided by the school can&rsquo;t be changed, but there are
            a number of students opposing this like Ike.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Passing time with trusted allies. That&rsquo;s one of the things that no one wants to
            give up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Especially for Ike, it&rsquo;s no strange thing for him to panic, as depending on the
            evaluations he might not get a chance to group with his new girlfriend.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As the commotion kept spreading, one man stood up in order to put a halt to it.
            It&rsquo;s Yousuke.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I agree with the school&rsquo;s thinking.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Among all the dissenting opinions flying around, he expressed his support, as if
            cutting off the vanguard.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice for you, Hirata. I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of people
            whom you get along well with in the other classes, so if you&rsquo;re boasting, we don&rsquo;t need
            it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It is true that for Yousuke who has a wide range of friendships, it doesn&rsquo;t
            matter who he groups with. But, there&rsquo;s no way that Yousuke would speak out in order to brag about
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. There is not even one student from the other classes that
            I know better than my classmates. Because I think it&rsquo;s no good to step into things unprepared, you
            know.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">[ TL Note 7 : Rephrased in a more natural way. I&rsquo;m trying to be accurate to the
            original text as well. What the character means here is that he doesn&rsquo;t know anyone from the other
            classes that well since he wouldn&rsquo;t want to get into any trouble by entangling with them. ]</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">First, Yousuke insisted that his future is on the same side as Ike and the
            others.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Then why are you in support of this?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Because I felt a sure significance about it. Leaving aside the club activities,
            this school is quite unconnected, &nbsp;and I had been feeling that there are very few chances to connect
            with students from the other classes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">You could easily say that is necessary.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">There are cases of becoming temporary allies with other students because of some
            special test or such, but, as classes are usually in a struggle with each other, as Yosuke also said, there
            is a tendency to avoid being deeply involving with the other students.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">From the point of view of a person with a gentle heart, it would make things
            unnecessarily difficult.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Then isn&#39;t it strange you agree with this after all? It&#39;s easier to
            fight against rivals or people you aren&#39;t close with.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Hmm... But I think that friends are friends and that it has nothing to do with
            the classes, so...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The opinions are divided between the girls too. This is an issue of
            viewpoints.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Does the chicken come first or the egg? I think that&#39;s where this is going.
            A friend before a rival, or a rival before a friend? I&#39;m sure that both of those answers are correct.
            Isn&#39;t the trip a good chance to learn that, like the teacher said? We have more than one choice. The
            more we have, the wider the possibilities will be. That&#39;s what I think.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;I think I get what you&#39;re saying, Hirata. But, you know, it ain&#39;t like
            the school will change the rules if we struggle here anyway, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If they are willing to be flexible because of our complaining, there is a point in
            resisting.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, the students must already know that this isn&#39;t the case.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;It&#39;s not a bad thing to get excited with an argument, but may I continue
            speaking first? After you hear the concrete details, it will be easier for you all as well to talk things
            through.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After saying so, she changed the screen from the schedule.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;It is decided that during the four night five day stay, the students will be
            grouped as evenly as possible. Fundamentally, one group will be made of 8 people. However, there are 156
            people in the Second Year. As we cannot divide it with 8 people groups, there will be 2 - 6 people groups
            made. We will also adjust them to make the ratio of genders as equal as possible.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The 4 who have been expelled are evenly divided into 2 girls and boys, but the fact
            that they belong to different classes raises a problem; the eight people groups can be divided cleanly, but
            the 6 people groups will have some unevenness.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">However, this is an unavoidable point, so there&#39;s nothing to do about it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Of course, this is all only if there are no new expulsions or students dropping out
            because of poor health until the day of the trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;As for how much you&#39;ll be moving together with the group, that depends on
            after we reach Hokkaidou.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The group rules are being shown not just by words, but also on the monitor.</span>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c39">Situations where group conduct is necessary:</span></p>
    <p class="c11"><span class="c39"></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">We will depart from the school with buses divided among the classes, and go to Haneda
            airport. From there, we&#39;ll take a plane to Shinchitose Airport and disembark. After, it seems that
            we&#39;ll be divided into our groups inside the airport.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">From then on, until we go back to the school with a bus, group conduct will be the
            general rule.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Including going to the airport from the school and our movements after reaching
            Hokkaidou, we will move together as a group with a bus most of the time. Including sleeping time, it seems
            that we&#39;ll spend most of our time with our group members.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Free conduct doesn&#39;t mean that each individual can do whatever they want
            either. Discussion within the group will always be necessary, so group conduct is absolute. In case your

    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If it&#39;s for just one day, it&#39;s easy to just bare with somebody.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Even if you end up with a group you don&#39;t like, you can just pass the time
            patiently until your group changes the following day.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">On the other hand, if it is decided that your group will stay the same, you have to
            handle it somehow.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Those of you who have a lot of friends from other classes like Hirata and
            Kushida may have an easy time getting along with any group. In reverse, for people with little friends,
            there may be a development where they struggle no matter what group they&#39;re with. However, &nbsp;think
            of it as a chance to progress.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Of course, human relationships aren&#39;t as simple as these words.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">If you&#39;re a type that can&#39;t make friends even though you want to, it may be a
            chance to move forward as Chabashira-sensei says, but for those who think friends are unnecessary it will be
            a slightly burdensome school trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Well, that kind of person would already feel troubled by a school trip right from the
            moment they learn of it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;If there is a case of someone being found out to not have followed the rule of
            staying with one group, their free conduct privileges may be taken away.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Free conduct being taken away. If something like that happens, half of the school
            trip would lose its meaning.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">In other words, following the conduct of the group that has formed is an absolute
            rule that must be protected.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Most students follow the rules, but there are some among them who will not,
            so&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">All of the students&#39; gazes turned towards Kouenji in the farthest back
            seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;What&rsquo;s up, guys? You all look so envious of me. I don&rsquo;t mind, you
            know, so just keep looking.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Kouenji, who had not been listening to Chabashira-sensei&#39;s explanation, said so
            and showed a cool smile.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">He&#39;s a man you can&#39;t read, in a variety of meanings, but he is coming to
            school and it&#39;s true that he is obedient. Maybe he won&#39;t cause trouble with the school trip&#39;s
            groups, either&hellip; Maybe.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">In any case, I&#39;m sure that most students don&#39;t want to be together with
            Kouenji as it&#39;s not clear at all what would happen after.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;About the method by which groups will be divided, it will not be by random, but
            it will be based on the list created earlier.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The task we took the trouble to spend our time on before the school trip&#39;s
            explanation started.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It seems like that was related to the divisions of the school trip&#39;s
            groups.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&quot;Also, about your cellphones that you use, you can keep using them without an
            issue during the school trip as well. However, the restrictions about the people you can call will not
            change. Calls to the Second Year students who are still enrolled in the school, and emergencies such as the
            police or ambulance are allowed. However, communication with family or those outside the school is still
            forbidden. Your call history is managed by the school, so be careful.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">The so-called theme of this school trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It&#39;s difficult to believe that this is purely for the sake of making the students
            get along better with each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">It can be seen as one of the strategic steps for the school life that lies ahead of
            us.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Chabashira-sensei continued talking about the school trip after that too, but the
            most important and unusual point was the creation of the groups formed from among all of the second year
            students.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Other than that, I guess the management of money will also be of some
            importance.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">As we don&#39;t have anything except private points, we do not possess a method to do
            shopping outside the facilities. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Because of that, it seems there is a system where you can exchange your private
            points for money beforehand in the school and supply yourself with money. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Further, in case you run out of money on location, they will apparently exchange for
            you 10,000 Yen at most. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c4">After the school trip is over and we return, it seems that you can convert your money
            back to private points, so I think the best way to do this is to exchange for a large amount of money at the
            start.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>

    <h3 class="c14" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span>Part 3</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When lunch break came, I headed to have lunch with Kei, as was usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, unlike usual, there are numerous guests.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This is like some double date, huh, Ayanokoji-kun?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a hint of embarrassment, Satou muttered so while standing by me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, hey, Maya-chan! That&#39;s not something to say to Kyotaka, is
            it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We walked as the girls were in a conversation that could be considered both a fight
            and a friendly chat.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s my first time in Hokkaidou, you know. Kiyotaka, have you been there
            before?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, I haven&#39;t.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For someone like me who&#39;s been in the White Room, it&#39;s not a territory I have
            experience on.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have been to a variety of locations and had some experiences, but Hokkaidou is not
            among them. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The only things I know about that world is the fact that it&#39;s extremely cold and
            the stuff I&#39;ve seen on television or in textbooks.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The conversation ended up being focused on the school trip, after all.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Anyway, are high school school trips really this free? Don&#39;t we have too
            much freedom?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I was surprised too. I thought that we would be granted maybe an hour or two of
            free conduct at most.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Isn&#39;t it good to have a lot of free time? I think it&#39;s definitely
            better than wasting time in museums or sitting around listening to people talk.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke laughed at that reaction, and Satou also nodded strongly to show her
            agreement.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for me... Spending my days in an orthodox way like that wouldn&#39;t be so bad
            either, but...</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If we have too much freedom, things will deviate away from the form of a school
            trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I am a bit worried about the groups, I think. I welcome the direction to get
            along well with other classes, but I can&#39;t help but feel like there&#39;s gonna be something else ahead
            of that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;After you start getting along well?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yousuke nodded, and looked at me as if expecting an answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;As long as we are fighting over the one and only Class A, feelings like pity
            will only hold us back.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people think like that after all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For Yousuke who feels this direction strongly already, this might feel
            complicated.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The danger of becoming too close is always entangled with the desire to become
            friends with someone.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m a bit scared. I&#39;m scared of meeting people from other classes who
            absolutely have to graduate in Class A for some reason, getting to know their circumstances, and becoming
            close with them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm... I see. I think I kind of understand what you&#39;re saying too,
            Hirata-kun. It&#39;s empathetic.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I think Satou also used her imagination, and she was a little convinced.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t really think that way though, you know? I mean, it&#39;s more
            important that I rise up to Class A myself... Am I a cold person?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kei denied such feelings straight up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This wasn&#39;t being cold, it was the majority&#39;s real opinion.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No one can see a person&rsquo;s true feelings. This is just the way I think,
            but, people can easily get along with others on a superficial level, if it&rsquo;s limited to a certain
            place and time. Furthermore, people hate letting others see their unpleasant feelings.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Feelings of love and hate are such a burden.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s say that there are students who have to graduate in Class A. If they
            don&#39;t get into Class A, they may even lose their lives.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? That&#39;s a bit too grand...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It is an exaggeration, of course. However, the reality is that it could be
            true.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No one knows where the limits of someone&#39;s feelings lie other than that person
            themselves.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s say that you know the situation, and possess more than 20,000,000
            private points as a class. However, you also have to use the points to protect your own classmates. You can
            fight without it, &nbsp;but it&#39;s an important insurance. What if someone in that situation, like you,
            says that they want to do anything they can to save the students whose life might be on the line
            ?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Eh... That&#39;s...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What if the class ended up in a place where the students are willing to say
            that they are willing to help the class, while inwardly thinking &quot;no way&quot; and being secretly
            against it? Wouldn&#39;t it create a possibility of students just pretending to help on a surface
            level?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If they opposed, they would be looked down upon for taking people&rsquo;s lives
            lightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The reality is, I don&#39;t know what even the people I scorn are thinking on the
            inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I continued exaggerating a bit, but knowing your enemy is also a
            disadvantage.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then why is the school trying to make us friendly with each
            other?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As if she said all of her points, Kei&#39;s words came to a halt.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Somehow, in the future... It may be related to some special exam or something,
            maybe..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess I can&#39;t deny that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As we are now, at least, among most of the students from the other classes, we
            wouldn&#39;t pay attention to who gets expelled.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the people we aren&#39;t close with disappear, then we get closer to Class
            A.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That list, and the school trip, these may just be the stage setting with the
            end term test being the main thing.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In that case, it may become troublesome... That&#39;s genuinely scary for
            me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I feel the same. This feels bad, somehow.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both Yousuke and Satou moved through the conversation and started understanding the
            fear for the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">At this stage, we can&#39;t know if expulsion will be involved or not, but it will
            certainly be harder than last year.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span>Part 4</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After school, the students who have been yearning for a school trip did not lose
            their enthusiasm.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I received a message from a certain person, someone, who has always been one step
            below me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that this person wants to meet me by a bench near Keyaki Mall.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">My girlfriend Kei should have plans today to hang out in the dorm with Satou and a
            few other girls.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can ignore the message, or even change the day, but this timing works well for me
            too.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m curious about what&#39;s going on, so I think it&#39;s best we meet
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I replied that we would meet right away, and I headed towards the place we agreed
            upon.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than planned, I decided to sit down on the
            bench and wait.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With the timing being right after school ended for the day, students were walking
            past the bench headed for Keyaki Mall.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, what I&#39;m curious about is the choice of such a conspicuous place for our
            meeting.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure that there was also the fear that I would take precaution and choose not
            to come to the meeting, but that does not fit this person&#39;s character.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The fact that I was contacted in advance is also an inconsistency.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Is it simply because of a mental issue, or is there some other power moving?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From then on, I kept watching the crowd of students heading for Keyaki Mall, but
            then...</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even as the promised time came, the person in question did not arrive.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s normal to arrive slightly earlier or later, so I didn&#39;t worry and kept
            surfing the internet.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yoo-hoo~&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I was accessing the internet on my phone and killing time, the voice of a girl
            coming from the distance reached me. When I looked up, I confirmed that it was the person who sent the
            message, Amasawa Ichika.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase, who should be from another class, is also there by Amasawa&#39;s side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In contrast to the smiling Amasawa, Nanase looks a bit surprised.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After they waved at me and approached, they stopped a few centimeters before my
            eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Kept you waiting.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Nanase is with you too, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As there is no way I can ignore her right in front of my eyes, so I&#39;ll greet her
            formally.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes. Please excuse me for joining in without giving you a notice.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, there is no need to apologize, really. It was slightly unexpected,
            though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because after I was summoned here, I had guessed that I would be talking one on one
            with Amasawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Such doubts were about to be resolved by Amasawa&#39;s words right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The reason I ended up being late is because I was stopped by
            Nanase-chan.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She said so, and pointed to Nanase, putting the responsibility on her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Further, she insisted on following along. I guess she wanted to meet you that
            badly?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh, is that so?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, no...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase panicked a little, but denied Amasawa&#39;s words right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I came because I was curious about Amasawa-san&#39;s conduct, but I did not
            know that she was meeting with you here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh~? Did I not say? I think I did, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You only said it when we met eyes with Ayanokoji Senpai, though...&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A-ha-ha-ha, I guess I did.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So that&#39;s why she looked flustered when we met eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I listened on as the two first years explained the situation to each other.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, as it doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s about to leave, Nanase must have her own
            reason for joining in.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For now, I&#39;ll leave Nanase aside and focus my attention on Amasawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I heard you took a break from school for a while?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You know a lot, huh? So you were curious about me and did a little
            investigation? Well, I&#39;m okay with having a stalker as long as it&#39;s you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amasawa hasn&#39;t showed up in the school since the vacation days after the culture
            festival ended.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not like she had fallen ill or something.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I was giving a report to Ayanokoji Senpai.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait, Nanase-chan, you were the stalker!?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a purposeful overreaction, Amasawa raised both her hands up.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A girl, huh... Well, we are in the age of diversity, right? And Nanase is cute,
            right? Maybe it&#39;s not so weird.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Please don&#39;t have random misunderstandings like that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In contrast to the highly excited Amasawa, Nanase calmly said so.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s actually why I called out to Amasawa-san today. You&#39;ve been
            taking a break from school ever since Yagami-kun was expelled. It was clear that this wasn&#39;t because of
            a physical ailment, but a mental one, so it&#39;s only natural that I felt some suspicion when you suddenly
            came back.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s only natural to feel distrust and become watchful when a White Room student
            suddenly returns.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yagami Takuya. I&#39;ve made some guesses, but there&#39;s no doubt that the student
            was from the same White Room as Amasawa, even after the expulsion affair.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It isn&#39;t hard to imagine that he held strong feelings towards his ally
            Amasawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I learned that you would be meeting Ayanokoji Senpai. After that, there was no
            way I could leave.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re like a knight protecting Senpai, huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s nothing that grand, but I judged that with your current mental state,
            there is no knowing what you will do.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It also seems like a series of coincidences, but I&#39;m sure Nanase was making some
            speculations in her own way.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s hard to believe that Amasawa is coming to the school just to take classes
            after finishing her vacation.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...It&#39;s like that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amasawa has been acting cheerfully until now, but I can&#39;t feel her usual bright
            energy anymore.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought that it&#39;s a bit bothersome but that it would be
            alright.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The fact that you&#39;re still in the school means that you&#39;ve found the
            answer by yourself, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I asked so, the smile from Amasawa&#39;s face quietly disappeared right
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From the way her eyes swayed, I could see that this was not the case.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Senpai, why did you not give an instruction to take me along? I think you could
            have easily gotten me expelled along with Takuya, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You gave more importance to enjoying your time in this school rather than
            getting me expelled. That&#39;s how it looked like to me, at least. So I had no intention of trying to force
            you to be expelled.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No, in the first place, it&#39;s the same for Yagami too.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We never had a frank discussion, but if he had given priority to remaining in the
            school, then there wouldn&#39;t have been a necessity to get him expelled.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Despite what you think, Senpai, I haven&#39;t come up with an answer yet. As I
            was thinking that there would be a place for me here even if I return... Time just passed me
            by.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, she laughed in a self-deprecating manner.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She does also have the choice of baring fangs against me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Still, I found some direction. That&#39;s why I called you here,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, that&#39;s right. If it&#39;s possible to remain here, of course
            you&#39;d start thinking that you should. You can&#39;t return to White Room either, and you have no idea
            where your parents are even if you get expelled. Since you&#39;d have nowhere to go, it would be unpleasant
            to have to get some part-time job or something in order to live, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you&#39;re lost on the roadside, then you have to do anything you can in order to
            keep living.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, as long as you remain in this school, your livelihood is guaranteed until
            you graduate.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, there is a system where your private points are purchased by the school in
            the end.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">According to what I heard before, it wouldn&#39;t be an equal exchange, but even if
            it&#39;s only half it would still be a considerable income.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After receiving some money, it would be possible to spend some time trying to find a
            proper job.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Or, the third path. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I suppose Amasawa doesn&#39;t consider this as she does not know where they are, but
            there is also the choice of searching for her parents and returning home.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, if she formally becomes a drop-out from White Room, there is fundamentally
            no guarantee in how she will be treated.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, whether or not she can pick that choice depends on Amasawa&#39;s
            parents.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">First and foremost, Amasawa&#39;s parents should be wealthy celebrities with a lot of
            power.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If White Room also learns that Amasawa is a child of fame, the possibility of them
            treating her gently increases.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Further, her parents must give importance to their daughter Ichika.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If these two conditions are fulfilled, there is a way for Amasawa to start a life as
            a normal girl.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps puzzled by my silence, Amasawa spoke up in a modest voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll remain in this school. If that&#39;s not a problem for you, Ayanokoji
            Senpai...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What if I told you to drop out?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll drop out.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Insistence, anger, or perhaps sorrow.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I was wondering how her reaction would be, Amasawa instantly said so.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You seem certain, huh. Don&#39;t you want to get revenge for
            Yagami?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have no intention of causing any more trouble.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This means that she came here possessing a resolve fitting of her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Those words aren&#39;t fitting for a belligerent person like you,
            Amasawa-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s correct. This is only a special treatment for Ayanokoji Senpai. I
            have no intention of holding back with anybody else from now on either.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">These must be her true feelings. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that Amasawa values Yagami more than I thought, as a fellow student of White
            Room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is a high possibility that the people related to Yagami&#39;s expulsion will
            become her targets from now on.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s no reason for me to be against it. If you want to remain here, then
            you can do as you like.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know how relaxing it will be, but I relaxed my cheeks with a little
            joy.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So my strength is so insignificant before yours that you feel no threat from
            me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not like that. I&#39;m also one of the people remaining in this
            school, so it&#39;s only natural that I&#39;d want to support you if you were to make the same
            choice.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether she&rsquo;s a friend or ally is a different problem.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, I can&#39;t just ignore her if she ends up being a hindrance to my
            plans.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;d like to think that after the affair with Yagami, she understands this
            well.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re really speaking from the heart, Amasawa-san, then I shall support
            you too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase&#39;s expression was still watchful, but she replied so.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, some water from my eyes is... This, what is this, I wonder... I never felt
            this before.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Come on, there are no tears coming out at all, though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A-ha, that&#39;s weird. Even though I&#39;m so moved...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s always been like this, but she&#39;s forcing herself to put on an act in
            order to try and move us.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I may not want to hear this, but what kind of guy was Yagami?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m curious too. I don&#39;t understand why he continued his roundabout
            ways before getting you expelled.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Why did he hurt Shinohara and the others&#39; group even while knowing the risk is
            high?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Why did he push unrelated students from Year 1 Class C into expulsion?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The school also announced Yagami&#39;s scandal, so a lot of people learned of
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for Nanase, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot she&#39;s curious about.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She pretended to think about it a little, but &nbsp;started speaking right
            away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think Takuya was scared. Scared of fighting against you, Ayanokoji Senpai.
            Yet, I&#39;m sure that such feelings of dread were so deep in his heart that even he was not aware of
            them.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Amasawa, who should know Yagami better than anyone, made such an analysis.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure that I don&#39;t need to interrupt her and ask the details, this should
            be the correct answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In order to escape from the fear, without noticing it himself, he made detours,
            and detours, and...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As the final result, he had ended up digging his own grave.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think it might take a little bit more time until I go back to my usual self.
            But, I think... I think I&#39;ll get better very soon.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&#39;s no need to force herself and hurry.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It hasn&#39;t even been one year since Amasawa&#39;s school life started.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She can just slowly think about her path from now on.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I just wanted to tell you that. So, I&#39;ll go back for today. What about you,
            Nanase-chan?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It looked like she asked her &quot;wanna leave together?&quot;, but Nanase shook her
            head.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m going to have a chat with Senpai. It&#39;s okay,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see. I&#39;ll lend him to you, a special occasion for today,
            then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m not yours, but I suppose she&#39;s trying her best to put on a brave
            face.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without staying in this place for too long, Amasawa headed towards her dorm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase and I looked on together in silence until she disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase&#39;s expression from the side looked fierce.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you think about her words, demeanour, and mannerisms?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m still a bit worried about her causing problems in the
            future.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that she was looking at her with such fierce eyes because she was worried
            about this.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can&#39;t trust her?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t want to trust Amasawa-san. But, I&#39;m saying
            that we can&#39;t be careless, after all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She expressed it in a mild way, but it&#39;s certain that she doesn&#39;t trust
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I won&#39;t be careless. Rather, I should just say that nothing has
            changed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m in this school in order to live my school life.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether they&#39;re close by or far away, I won&#39;t be influenced by my
            opponents.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m just needlessly worrying... Right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m grateful for the sentiment. I&#39;m glad to have even one ally, you
            see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that she understood my thoughts in her own way, but Nanase continued.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m prepared to be thought of as being insistent, so I&#39;ll say this one
            more time. Your abilities, and the possibility of Amasawa-san&#39;s reform. Please keep them in mind and be
            careful. It is a certain truth that Amasawa-san is a student of White Room. We can&#39;t know what kind of
            methods she will use.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s Nanase&#39;s strong wish that I be prepared for every possible
            situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I want you to remain in this school, and graduate, Ayanokoji
            Senpai.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I won&#39;t say we&#39;re unrelated, but Nanase looks like she&#39;s worried more
            about me than herself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re ever in trouble, no matter how insignificant it is, please do ask
            me for advice.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I understand well what you want to say. I&#39;ll keep it in mind.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After our exchange up until now, Nanase finally looks like she&#39;s
            satisfied.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I will take my leave, then.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase, perhaps thinking that she&#39;s starting to get annoying, turned around and
            headed for the dorm.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Despite repeatedly being vigilant against Amasawa, there are times when she is
            strangely entangled.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to confirm that, I decided to dig a little deeper.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I forgot to say it, but the school trip is this week.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, I see. It was, wasn&#39;t it? Senpai, please enjoy it as much as you can.
            School trips are the true charm of a school life, you know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s my intention.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It feels strange, after all. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether she knew about the school trip or not, she should have something to say to
            me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yet, Nanase isn&#39;t showing any signs of such a thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s almost as if she&#39;s completely forgotten about it already.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is there something you&#39;d like as a present?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I stopped Nanase, and tried to dig into the matter of the school trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;By the way, where is the destination?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s Hokkaidou.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wow, Hokkaidou, huh? That&#39;s nice. If it&#39;s Hokkaidou, then... Maybe
            butter?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a bit strange to give butter itself as a present...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If that is really her first choice then I won&#39;t decline, but it doesn&#39;t seem
            like it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, then some chocolate coated potatoes would be good. They&#39;re famous,
            right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I don&#39;t know, actually.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It ended up being a mutually confusing conversation.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Chocolate potatoes, I&#39;ll look into it later. If I find some over there,
            then I&#39;ll buy some for you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you very much.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Nanase said so and tried to leave again, I strongly urged her to stop.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Nanase. Can I ask one thing?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes? What is it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The matter of Amasawa and the matter of the school trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even if normal students can&#39;t see the relation, Nanase can.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No, it would even be strange if she couldn&#39;t.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Despite worrying about me, you haven&#39;t spoken of your worries about the
            school trip at all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t get it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Right after I said this to try and get her to think it over, the soft smile on
            Nanase&#39;s face stiffened in an instant.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This school is a facility with strict security that is protected from the
            outside 24 hours a day. In fact, even Tsukishiro himself sneaked inside and tried to expel me. However, with
            the school trip, things will change a lot. There will be a lot of times with no teachers looking, times when
            we&#39;ll have to be even more careful than when we were on the uninhabited island.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s right, the risks there should be greater than an Amasawa with her fangs
            pulled out.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you know these people, then you can even imagine that they would even use
            methods such as forcing me into their car. If you&#39;re worried so much about Amasawa, then you should be
            saying a few more things. Such as &quot;please be careful&quot;. Am I wrong?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She didn&#39;t understand how Amasawa would conduct herself, so she kept checking up
            on her until her arrival at school.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, she figured that Amasawa would contact me, and even followed her until this
            place.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After all that, there&#39;s no way Nanase is not aware of the dangers of the school
            trip.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;ve defeated Yagami-kun and Amasawa-san; there&#39;s no need for someone
            like me to worry about you...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s strange. If that was the case, there would be no need for you to be
            here today by Amasawa&#39;s side, watching over us. The fact that you&#39;ve insistently been warning me
            creates a contradiction. Unlike the outside world where the majority holds the power, even if she is a White
            Room student, Amasawa is one person. The danger she poses is insignificant.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase was confused, but she was about to open her mouth right away, then... No words
            came out.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can&#39;t think of an excuse?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you saying? You seem to be having a misunderstanding, Ayanokoji
            Senpai.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She was clearly in turmoil until just a moment ago, but Nanase was now calm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It may be a misunderstanding. If so, despite worrying about Amasawa and looking
            out for me, why haven&#39;t you spoken of your unease about the school trip?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s embarrassing, but I think my confirmation was insufficient. Even
            though the outside world is full of dangers, when you think about it...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase, replying that she was simply being insufficient.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Truly, if that is the case, then I can understand why the conversation went that
            way.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, coming to a conclusion with that, is something I unfortunately cannot
            do.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have always had a suspicion ever since I&#39;ve met you. It&#39;s about the
            relation between Tsukishiro, the White Room students, and you. You should have received various instructions
            from Tsukishiro, but why didn&#39;t you let me know about anything concrete?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase Tsubasa had her feelings used by Tsukishiro in order to take revenge on Matsuo
            Eiichirou&rsquo;s enemy, and she followed Tsukishiro&rsquo;s orders.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">On one hand, nothing about the White Room students&#39; identities was made clear to
            Nanase.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe it&#39;s because... I&#39;m just an ordinary person? It&#39;s only
            natural that I wouldn&#39;t be trusted as long as I don&#39;t possess the power that the White Room students
            do.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;At first, I did not appraise the man called Tsukishiro to be of a high value.
            That&#39;s because I thought that there must be a more efficient way of causing me to get expelled. However,
            as I kept coming in contact with him, I changed my mind. That man could actually push me into expulsion, I
            thought.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s so much that I could even think he was holding back on purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;In the end, you were not expelled. Isn&#39;t that because your real abilities
            exceeded Former Stand-In Chairman Tsukishiro&#39;s assumptions?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If it&#39;s going to end so simply, then that may be so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In other words, there is a possibility that this chain of events is not of such a
            simple structure.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re going back to this again, but, I think that there is a different
            reason for you being cautious against Amasawa, but not the dangers of the outside world.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;My lack of judgement is the true reason. What else do you think it could
            be?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Isn&#39;t it because you couldn&#39;t estimate what Amasawa&#39;s conducts will
            be like at this time today? And, the reason that you didn&#39;t warn me about the dangers of the school
            trip, isn&#39;t it because you know that the White Room has no ill plans or intentions towards
            me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If there is no probability of them making war on me, then it&#39;s only natural that
            Nanase wouldn&#39;t be worried.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t really understand. How can you say that there is no such
            possibility?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s what I want to ask about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;After hearing this conversation, I fully understand the school trip&#39;s
            dangers. Now, I think I&#39;d like you to be more cautious for the school trip than against
            Amasawa-san.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter how many times I repeated the question, Nanase insisted that it was a lack
            of judgement.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This is nothing but a hypothesis, but may I ask you something?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;From the start, Tsukishiro never had any intention of expelling me...
            That&#39;s my hypothesis.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although the premise up until now will be overturned, this hypothesis connects many
            things together.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Isn&#39;t that strange? How will you explain the presence of Amasawa-san or
            Yagami-kun? We can understand from the conversation with Amasawa-san that Yagami-kun in particular was
            moving to expel you.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If we say that Amasawa and Yagami were earnest because they were not told about
            the true objective by the people above them, then it all fits together.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But what about Stand-In Chairman Tsukishiro? He utilized his significant
            position to use various forceful methods.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If he was earnest, then I probably would have been expelled
            already.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before talking about my real abilities or such, I should have been expelled by one of
            the countless options.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I understand your thinking. It could indeed be true that the intention was
            hidden as you say. But, you including me in all that... It&#39;s a bit upsetting. I don&#39;t want to be
            thought of as an enemy just because I missed the school trip&#39;s danger.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Then, I&#39;ll ask for a follow-up, what about the culture festival? Without a
            doubt, I was approached by someone related to White Room, but you didn&#39;t appear before me even once. Is
            that also a lack of judgement?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...That&#39;s...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Were you simply too busy with your own class&#39; program? With your worries
            being of secondary importance.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, that&#39;s wrong. Umm, of course I was worried. I even checked up on you
            now and then, and...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you sure? So plainly telling me that you were watching me. If you say that,
            then I&#39;ll end up asking where and when you were watching me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter what kind of person Nanase is, she should know me well enough. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is inevitable that I will see right through her if she clumsily makes a false
            statement like that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I still remember the events of the culture festival in detail. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even at the Cultural Festival, they didn&#39;t try to force me out of the
            school. There was a voluntary push, but they should know very well that I would not be expelled so easily.
            That&#39;s why you didn&#39;t show up.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">While trying to keep her emotions under control, Nanase breathed quietly. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;White Room never intended to expel me, not at the Culture Festival, and not at
            the school trip. No, they had no such plan from the start. If this hypothesis is correct, then your presence
            looks extremely strange, Nanase.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...........&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Did Matsuo really kill himself? Then, did his son, Eiichirou really die? With
            your words from the point of view of a third party, Matsuo&#39;s death looked to be true, but if you have
            been here as a calculated plan from the beginning, all of your credibility is lost.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both, what we talked about on the uninhabited island and that she has been standing
            in my way first like an enemy and then as an ally, it all loses its assurance.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It is all true, Ayanokoji Senpai. Even if I say that, if you&#39;re suspicious
            of me like that, even if it&#39;s hypothetical, then your doubts won&#39;t be cleared.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to find out if this is the truth or not, I have to investigate the official
            copy of the family register. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, if the White Room side is involved, even that would be unreliable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;According to that hypothesis, what&#39;s the reason that I&#39;ve come to this
            school? It doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, there is an explanation. If you were an aid to me, then it all makes sense.
            You were supposed to support me in the unlikely event where I&rsquo;m about to be expelled by the White Room
            students Yagami and Amasawa. I can simply think of how you disputed with me over the Matsuo affair as a way
            for you to make me let my guard down.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Fought as enemies and turned into allies. Depending on the time and circumstances,
            trust can be built up in a short amount of time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s exactly what Amasawa said about being given the role of a knight....
            That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tsukishiro gave the group of Nanase, Yagami and Amasawa the duty of expelling
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He gave Nanase the role of pretending to be an enemy, to see my capabilities and then
            becoming an ally.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In this role, it is also possible for her to make truthful deductions by my side by
            deliberately not giving me information about the White Room students. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s only a hypothesis. In truth, there is still a high enough possibility
            that they really are aiming to expel me. In either case, there is no loss for me. If this hypothesis is
            correct, then you&#39;re a simple ally, and if it isn&#39;t, then there is no changing the fact that you
            have been an ally.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no concept of two sides of a coin, just the same pattern on both sides.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, I shall keep this in the corner of my mind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The possibility that that man is not moving to expel me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then, what does he want?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From which stage?</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Matsuo&#39;s life and death, his son&#39;s life and death. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether it is the truth or a lie, its impact on the situation is insignificant.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If everything that has happened so far has been turned upside down... </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everything may have been decided from the start, even my enrollment into this school.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No matter what I say now, Ayanokoji Senpai is not going to just accept it,
            right? My only choice is to clear your doubts with time. That&#39;s what I think.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It isn&#39;t clear whether there is a way to clear my doubts or not, but I
            suppose you&#39;re right. In fact, I would rather have them treat me the same way that they always
            have.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That can&#39;t happen. In that case, I... I can&#39;t accept that.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nanase quickly bowed her head, and began walking towards the road home.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, there is no way Nanase would be as physically fit as a White Room student.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no telling the depths of her academic abilities, but even when it comes to
            the way she thinks, she is a step behind Amasawa and the others. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&#39;s still something I don&#39;t know about Nanase. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That hunch, at least, was surely true. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c14" id="h.17dp8vu"><span>Part </span><span class="c34">5</span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After 7 pm, when the sun had completely set, Sudou visited the room. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry to barge in without telling you. ...Hmph, hmph... Is it curry
            today?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou muttered so while sniffing the smell of supper, which had gone all the way to
            the front door. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He suddenly looked at the two shoes lined up in the entrance hallway. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is someone here?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I was just making some curry to eat with Kei.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Karuizawa, huh..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as I replied, the door leading to the living room opened and Kei in her
            personal clothes showed her face. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is it a problem if I&#39;m here?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No, of course not. What is this, are you guys always together..?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From his reaction, I can predict that he visited because he thought no one was here.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course we&#39;re always together. Because we&#39;re a couple.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine a couple being together 24 hours a
            day&hellip;&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou was about to object, but he dejectedly replied so, as if having imagined
            several couples already. Ike and Shinohara have been doing many conspicuous things in public recently too,
            like holding hands or shinohara sitting on her boyfriend&rsquo;s lap without caring about the people
            looking.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I think they even said they&#39;re going to a karaoke together after classes again
            today. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks like you&#39;re back from club activities, Sudou.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have the impression that he usually returns at around this time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t have a girlfriend, you know, so basketball is all I
            have.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s... I don&#39;t know how to respond to those words. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Anyway, I&#39;m sorry to delay your meal, but do you have a second? Don&#39;t
            worry; it won&#39;t take that much time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is probably something confidential, seeing as he checked the shoes earlier.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You can start eating.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Eh~? I&#39;ll wait. It won&#39;t take long, right? He said it won&#39;t take a
            lot of time, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When asked again, Sudou thought for a moment, but when he replied that it would take
            less than 5 minutes, Kei was satisfied and closed the door. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I put on my shoes, and went out onto the corridor with Sudou. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No matter what this is about, it is unthinkable that Kei would leak anything to a
            third party, but this should be more reassuring. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ayanokoji, you... Well, how should I put this? Umm... Did you already... With
            Karuizawa?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He asked me so in a muddy, vague manner. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll leave that to your imagination.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Wow... Isn&rsquo;t that like an answer already..?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">How he takes this reply depends on him. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So? What on earth do you want?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, oh, right. It&#39;s only natural that you&#39;re so popular, and I
            don&#39;t have the time to worry about that anyway.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Sudou checks his surroundings. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Actually, recently, the pressure from Onodera has been... Well, it&#39;s pretty
            heavy. So I&#39;ve been confused, you know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He spoke so not in a joyful manner... He looked quite troubled. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can see that the words I uttered at the festival are weighing heavily on Sudou day
            after day. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&#39;s why, as a person with responsibility, I have to earnestly listen to this
            kind of talk. Still, what needs to be corrected should be corrected. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;About Onodera&#39;s push, looking from the sidelines, not much has changed
            since after the Sports Festival. Perhaps you see it that way because it is your viewpoint that has
            changed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for Onodera, she is not even aware of her own fondness for Sudou. On the surface,
            it should only feel like inviting a friend out to dinner or to hang out. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...That may be true too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He is scratching his head and does not look to be calming down. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ever since you told me about Onodera, I can&#39;t calm down, or perhaps I
            should say that I feel uncomfortable. Even if we talk, I end up wondering what she really thinks on the
            inside.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As for Sudou, he should only see her as a good friend, on the same wavelength as his
            impression of her as a sportsman. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If Onodera knew that Sudou was fond of her, then it would be understandable for
            things to change. Then, the conversation with Sudou came to a halt. Around 10 seconds passed in silence.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So? What are you saying is the thing you wanted to talk to me about? I think
            that there&#39;s more to it, so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I pushed him so, Sudou came up with the resolve to start speaking again. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When I&#39;m with Onodera like that, you know... Some kind of bad feelings come
            up inside me. If we start dating someday, I might get my first girlfriend, and that it would be okay since
            Suzune isn&#39;t going to turn around to me anyway. Now, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m being objective, but,
            Onodera is pretty cute too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She and Sudou are very similar and are both stoic sportsmen. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If we only consider the compatibility, it&#39;s the best combination of those around
            us.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not a bad thing to think like that. In the first place, it isn&#39;t a
            sure thing that your fondness for someone from the other gender will be given back to you. In a lot of
            cases, it&#39;s only one sided.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That being said, not all of us can take it in stride. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou is also here, struggling with that. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe... Also, there&#39;s something else I think about. Maybe your judgement
            was wrong, and she simply thinks of me as a friend? In that case, my hubris would be embarrassing and I
            would be very confused.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is almost certain that Onodera has a fondness for Sudou. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, it is true that there is no proof of things being the way I think they are.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The arrow that is pointed at tomorrow could be pointed somewhere at someone else.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You have a lot on your mind too after all, don&#39;t you? I mean, Karuizawa was
            dating Hirata, so...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, you&#39;re right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The reality is completely different, but I will keep the conversation moving in that
            direction for now. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If, if Onodera confesses, I&#39;d be very scared, you know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What would you do if you were confessed to now?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No idea... No, wrong... That confession, I probably wouldn&#39;t accept
            it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He will quickly destroy his chance of finding happiness. That was Sudou&#39;s reply.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I do like her, after all. Suzune, I mean.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That is one of the certain answers that Sudou possesses now. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Just imagining how hurt she will be when I refuse her makes me feel
            bitter.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So you&#39;ve come here because you don&#39;t know the path you should
            take?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No... It&#39;s not like I&#39;m asking you for advice. This is about my
            feelings, it would be wrong if</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I asked someone else to answer.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that he did not come here seeking help. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ve come up with an answer for myself. I wanted you to hear
            it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s hear it, then. What kind of answer did you come up with?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll confess to Suzune properly during the school trip. I&#39;ll earnestly
            ask her to date me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems that this isn&#39;t about whether there is a chance of victory or not.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In order to break up this situation, he judged that he has to move on his own.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s because I like Suzune, and I can&#39;t imagine dating anyone else
            right now. No matter what kind of results it will bring, I want to make things clear.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou has shown rapid growth so far. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no doubt that Horikita values this highly too. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The probability may be low. I might get embarrassed. But, still...&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou thinks that if he does not convey his feelings, he cannot move forwards.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That is why he is determined to do this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Also, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m thinking I can just go for Onodera if I get
            refused, okay? Actually, I would probably get even more insistent...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, Sudou squeezed his fists tight. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I came to you today because I want you to witness my resolve.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Witness? Wait, do you mean when you confess?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I know confessions aren&#39;t usually something you show to the outside world,
            but I think I need this.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It may be the push he needs to come up with the courage to do this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">By cutting out his way of retreat, he will be able to speak out loud his feelings
            towards Horikita. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m going to put my hand out and ask her to date me. If she&#39;ll date me,
            then she&#39;ll grab my hand, and...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, he held out his own right hand, as if performing a rehearsal.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not at that stage yet, but I can tell that things have already heated up
            quite a bit. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he will put all of his feelings into words right in front of Horikita. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As things are right now, I certainly cannot say that his chances of success are high.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But... Perhaps the force of his thoughts and his determination will be conveyed.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s Horikita, so she may not answer an immediate romantic relationship. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, starting as friends as a first step is still a good idea. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I get it. I think it&#39;ll depend on the time and location, but I&#39;ll
            witness as much as I can. Are you okay with that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After I said so, Sudou patted his chest down as if he was relieved. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right, sorry. Asking you to do something like this... Well, that&#39;s pretty
            much it, so...</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ll let you know, so thank you. I&#39;m sorry for having disturbed your time
            together with Karuizawa.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudou, saying that he can&#39;t take up more of my time, headed for his room. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After seeing him off and returning to my own room, Kei was sitting on a cushion
            before the table. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Looks like the curry was also still waiting for me. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Welcome back~. What did you talk about?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;All kinds of stuff.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;All kinds? Come on, that&#39;s so mysterious. Tell me~. I&#39;ll keep it a
            secret, okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I can tell you, but can you stand up before that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hm?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I stood Kei up as she tilted her head curiously, and touched the surface of the
            cushion with my hand. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I did so, I felt a cold sensation. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You were listening, after all.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Did you notice?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she was waiting sitting down, then the cushion should have been warm. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Was my acting that bad?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Your performance was perfect. I just figured that you would be
            listening.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Uh... I see.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;And if you&#39;re going to try and trick me, you should have an excuse about
            the cushion. Like you went to the fridge to get drinks, or something. Other than water, there&#39;s milk and
            even tea.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh~? But, I haven&#39;t even eaten the curry yet, so wouldn&#39;t it be
            strange? There&#39;s water in my cup too. I know that you would have gone to the fridge to check how much of
            the drinks there were left.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re going to eavesdrop without being detected, then you need to do
            that much, at least. You can just drink the water, and if you will not put it in your body, you can just
            spill it out somewhere in the kitchen. There&#39;s a lot of water in the kitchen because of the cooking,
            so.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would be impossible to tell the spilled water apart. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the kitchen is not wet, then she could also use the toilet. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, that&#39;s not important. Come on, let&#39;s talk about the school
            trip.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Trying to escape the topic, Kei said so as she leaned forward. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s meaningless if we continue talking about this further, so I&#39;ll end it
            here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What did you think about the school trip schedule? The fact that there&#39;s a
            lot of free conduct is quite the topic in the class.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Looks that way. But, for me, it feels like a demerit. I mean, you can only pass
            that time with people from the same group, right? The chances of me ending up with you seem low too.
            Right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The possibility is around 5%. However, this is only if it will be determined purely
            by chance. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ugh, God, please let us be together!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kei crossed fingers on both hands, and prayed so to the heavens. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Even if we can&#39;t be together during free conduct, there are no restrictions
            when we are in the ryokan. In fact, I think this is a perfect opportunity for me to learn more about the
            students from other classes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I end up in the same group with Kei, we will naturally end up spending 24 hours a
            day together. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I won&#39;t say that it would be a bad time, but I feel like it would be a bit of a
            waste. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We will have a number of chances to spend time together, just as we do here. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm, it feels like you don&#39;t want to be in the same group as
            me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s not the case. But, you should be ready to enjoy your time even if we
            don&#39;t end up in the same group.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Kei may already understand this, but she does not seem to be accepting it. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She puffed her cheeks sulkily and hugged my shoulders. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re not there, I might die of loneliness.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re exaggerating.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I may need to do something to motivate Kei somewhat. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;There is a reason that I&#39;m fine with being in a different group than you.
            We&#39;re at a stage where in order to rise up to Class A, we must have information on the other classes.
            I&#39;m sure that most of the students on the school trip will be defenceless.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In response to a dissatisfied Kei, I continued further. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;After hearing about the school trip&#39;s schedule and the groups, I did some
            research on the internet about other schools. I found out that it is a rare thing for there to be two full
            days of free conduct. Thinking from here, I think that it is the school&#39;s objective to transform the
            classes&#39; relationships with each other.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;For what?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know that yet, but, either at the end of 2nd or 3rd semester...
            Well, in a nearby time, information from the school trip may come alive.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So you want me to gather information that can be used as a weapon?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Your abilities are remarkable, you know. If there is an opportunity, then
            I&rsquo;d like you to use them effectively.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I said so while patting her head, her dissatisfaction seemed to diminish a little.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, well? I understand that you want my help, but...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course, I intend to have fun together if we are in the same group. But, in
            case that doesn&#39;t happen, don&#39;t lose your motivation and try to be useful for the
            class.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Mhm. It&#39;s you saying that, so I&#39;ll work hard.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Repeatedly patting her head, I decided to change the subject. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;About Sudou earlier...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, about Sudou-kun confessing to Horikita-san, right? Yep, that&#39;s kind of
            interesting.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d take the bait, but she was more interested than I
            thought. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Girls seem to like other people&#39;s confession stories, so...&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course. Well, I definitely think he&#39;ll get rejected,
            though.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Eh? Do you think it&#39;ll go well?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I felt that there is a possibility. If we&#39;ll count it as a success if they
            start out with a relationship above a friendship, then I&#39;ll bet that it&#39;ll be a
            success.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;No way, really? Let&#39;s have a match, then. Let&#39;s bet on if he&#39;ll
            succeed or not.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you intend to bet?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm~. Then, if I win, maybe I&rsquo;ll ask for something a bit expensive as a
            Christmas gift~&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying so, she started imagining all sorts of things right away.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to understand. Then, what if I win?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do whatever you say.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure? You&rsquo;re willing to make such a big bet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on, there&rsquo;s no way, right? It&rsquo;s not about whether Sudou-kun
            is good or bad, it&rsquo;s about Horikita-san. She has no interest in romance.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is true that at a first glance, Horikita does not seem like the type to fall in
            love.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not to mention that if she is asked if she likes anyone in particular at this time,
            she would be very suspicious.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Horikita is still at a stage where she is learning a lot.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I cannot deny the possibility that she may step up to that stage like me.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If her partner is to be Sudou, then Horikita wouldn&rsquo;t have a bad
            impression.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah~ &nbsp;I&rsquo;m looking forward to Christmas~. I wonder what I should
            get&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take my time and think about what I&rsquo;ll have you
            do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, that feels a bit lewd!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s just Kei&rsquo;s own imagination.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
