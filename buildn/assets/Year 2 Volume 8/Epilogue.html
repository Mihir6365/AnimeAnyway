    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c41"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c14 c12" id="h.kgcv8k"><span>The Light That Shines Ahead of the Darkness</span></h2>
    <h3 class="c3 c12 c20 c25" id="h.34g0dwd"><span class="c26"></span></h3>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s close to 9pm, so there will be a very cold breeze outside.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Lights at each end of the stairs faintly illuminate the footing, but the snowy
            weather makes it difficult to say that it is sufficiently safe. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I climbed up the dozens of stairs, stepping on the snow to avoid falling. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure that no one would come here at a time like this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the darkness where I could not see my breath, I walked forward and arrived at
            a
            slightly open platform. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the wood deck... I saw a short person&#39;s back. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Perhaps they were staring at the scenery, but the darkness made them seem rather
            somber. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course, there were no other people around. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">They said they had seen her at meal time, but how long has she been at this
            location?
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The wind was strong and she didn&#39;t seem to notice that I was approaching.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I stomped my feet on the ground as hard as I could to avoid surprising her.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m sure she can hear. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I decided to speak up when her body reacted. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can I come over?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh... ah, Ayanokoji-kun!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;What a coincidence.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Y-yes, right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose let her gaze escape awkwardly into the night. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s really not a coincidence. Amikura and the others were
            making a
            fuss that they couldn&#39;t see you. They wanted to talk to you until the lights went out, so I
            came
            here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Is, is that right? Wh-what happened? Is there trouble?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;A bit. Let&#39;s just have a chat for now. If we do that, Amikura will be
            relieved too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you exchanging contacts with Mako-chan?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;We&#39;re the same group on the school trip, so. We often communicate with
            each
            other. &rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I added a message telling her not to worry, that I had found Ichinose, and that
            she
            would be back by 9 o&#39;clock. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It immediately became read. When Amikura learned that I knew where she was, she
            sent
            two stamps of relief. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s been passed on. At any rate, this should quiet down the
            ruckus.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s fine. This isn&#39;t breaking the curfew on the ryokan grounds. If
            you
            go back by 9 o&#39;clock when you are allowed to enter the backyard, it&#39;s up to the
            individual.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes... thanks.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She&#39;s not saying that she will go back in order not to worry them, so there
            must
            be something on her mind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">School trips are a fun time, but we have to share our time with a lot of
            students.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone wants to be alone sometimes. In that sense, I guess I&#39;m in
            the
            way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose didn&#39;t return anything to the words. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She just kept staring at the night scene. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So cold.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Mhm. It&#39;s cold.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even through the gloves, a piercing pain comes through when the wind
            blows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know... maybe, five minutes?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She answered, but then corrected herself in a frustrated manner, as if she
            thought I
            would immediately see through. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sorry. It could be around 30 or 40 minutes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I bet. The footprints on the stairs had disappeared.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Until I came up, I had no proof that Ichinose was here. If it had been a few
            minutes,
            I would have clearly seen the footprints even in the dark. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although the snow was slowly weakening, the wind was still strong. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s obvious, but if you stay too long, you&#39;ll catch a
            cold.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Right...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She mumbled as if she was talking about something else, but did not seem to be
            following my advice. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then, the snow almost stopped. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s just temporary, I&#39;m sure. Based on the forecast, it should start
            blowing
            hard soon. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll ask something dumb. What are you thinking, staring at the night
            view
            alone?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have a general idea of what to expect, but I still won&#39;t know until I hear
            it
            from her. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I asked, but Ichinose didn&#39;t answer immediately. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Without looking over at me, she kept looking at the view. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I think I want to be alone now...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">A light rejection. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She is saying that she isn&#39;t looking for someone to talk to, and is urging me
            to
            leave. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Or maybe she was just saying that she didn&#39;t want me to be the only one close
            by.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t feel like leaving you alone here after all. The descent is
            particularly dangerous.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you for your concern. But Karuizawa-san would be sad to know that
            you&#39;re alone with me in this place. I definitely don&#39;t want that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">No one comes over here, so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the problem. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It seems Ichinose cares about others even at times like this. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;It is true that if Kei sees this, she would misunderstand.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yep.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you sure about this?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yep.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose, who answered in the same short way one more time, still did not avert
            her
            gaze from the scenery. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I quickly moved away and turned my back. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll go back, then. Just, make sure you&#39;re back by 9 o&#39;clock.
            The
            door&#39;s going to get locked.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll be careful.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I took one step, the snow that had stopped suddenly began to fall again.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It came back even stronger than before. Looking back once, Ichinose&#39;s back
            had
            not changed since I found her here. It&#39;s grown so small and weak. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When was the last time I saw the lively Ichinose Honami from when she first
            entered
            the school? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not the school trip, but the accumulation of many things. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is getting to the point where the water that has been accumulating in the
            cracked
            cup is about to overflow. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s easy to walk away here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, this is a turning point. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose&#39;s emotions, which had been consumed, had come to a very dangerous
            place
            as far as I could see. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s still good if it&#39;s just overflowing with water. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the crack widens and the cup breaks, it may be impossible to put it back
            together.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That would be the demise of the Ichinose class. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The path to the A class would be closed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is not the moment for her class to fall. That would interfere with my plans.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll wait here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I said that, and decided to sit down on the stairs leading to the ryokan. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...Why?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I wonder why.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have nothing to do with you, Ayanokoji-kun, do I? Why are you
            waiting?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Who knows.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I said so and evaded. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I shouldn&#39;t say anything else for now.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I know she wants to get rid of me, but without any compelling force, she had no
            choice but to give up. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she really didn&#39;t want to be with me, it would be best to get out of here.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">This continued for a few minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For a while, we quietly passed the time without really doing anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe... we should chat?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Either she couldn&#39;t bear the silence of being alone with me, or she had no
            choice
            but to break it off. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose muttered in a voice that I might have missed if I had been thinking.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve been wanting to ask you something.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s better than being silent for the rest of the time. It can distract from
            the
            coldness of the snow that assaults my buttocks.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you know the White Room?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I wondered what kind of chatter would come out of this situation, but a few too
            many
            unexpected words came out, completely different from some of the assumptions that had been
            floating around
            in my mind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Why did the word &quot;white room&quot; come out of Ichinose? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">For a moment, the image of Sakayanagi appeared in my mind. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There have been some areas recently where leaders have been getting to know each
            other, such as cooperation between classes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But I don&#39;t think she&#39;d talk about it so easily. In which
            case&hellip;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She was threatened by Tsukishiro in the uninhabited island test. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she remembered the word &quot;white room&quot;
            from
            there. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah... If you don&#39;t understand, don&#39;t worry about it. Maybe I was
            wrong.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I said that, Ichinose&#39;s words stopped there, under the cold sky. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then she exhaled a white breath. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m not sure if she completely believed my answer. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just in case, I think I should press a little bit. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Where did you hear that word?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I added on so, to show her that I don&#39;t know the word at all. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she doesn&#39;t answer honestly, then I can just stop pursuing it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I heard Shiba-sensei talking to someone who was the acting board chairman
            during the uninhabited island test. There were not many parts that I could hear clearly, but I
            could hear
            the word &quot;white room&quot;, and him saying that they want to expel you. &nbsp;I was
            curious, so I did
            some searching and couldn&#39;t find anything, so I guess I heard wrong after all,
            huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I wonder. I can&#39;t think of any similar words myself, at
            least.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She&#39;s done the search herself, so it seems that she questions the consistency
            of
            her memory. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But why were the teachers trying to expel you? Are you all right
            now?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I guess she&#39;s always wanted to ask that too. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But with Kei, Ichinose seems to have pushed the question to the back of her mind.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;The matter is settled. I can&#39;t tell you the details, but there are no
            problems.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;ll separate from the White Room, and try to get her to think that there is
            some
            other secret. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because it is more troublesome in the future for the former situation to be
            leaked to
            the outside world. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I see...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I can&#39;t tell you&quot;, that part may have caught her attention a
            little.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I can&#39;t tell anyone, or I can&#39;t tell Ichinose? </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That would greatly change the way she receives it. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I could see her shock at the fact that she might be considered someone with whom
            I
            could not share my secrets. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Since there was no benefit to Ichinose in continuing with these topics, I&#39;ll
            start talking to her this time. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have a question for you. The Ichinose I know is not the kind of person
            who
            shivers with loneliness in a place like this. She is a student surrounded by friends, laughing
            and
            encouraging each other.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I said so, meaning to ask how long she will stay here. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m having enough fun. I am enjoying it.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;When I saw your face just now, it didn&#39;t look like that. It didn&#39;t
            seem
            like the kind of face you should show on a school trip that&#39;s all about fun.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even this kind of exchange should be necessary for Ichinose now. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">To expose the parts of ourselves that we would normally like to keep to ourselves
            and
            that we cannot talk about to anyone. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">That Ichinose, who continues to be under heavy pressure as a class leader,
            continues
            to endure. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you really going to wait there?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s right. I&#39;ll be with you when you come down.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;...I see. Well, at least come here, then. Your butt is going to get
            cold.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m grateful for that invitation. My butt is already almost
            frozen.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I got up in a hurry, wiped the snow off my butt, and returned to Ichinose&#39;s
            side.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose&#39;s sideways appearance was the same as before. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I checked with my mobile phone earlier, it was about 8:40. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If I calculate the return time, we can stay here for 10 more minutes. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she wants to stay silent until the time limit, that&#39;s fine too. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I decided to wait for Ichinose&#39;s reaction, intending to hang out until the
            end.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Snow dances every time the wind blows.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the meantime, Ichinose opened her lips after a dozen seconds. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her white breath flickered in the air. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;With my methods... I can&#39;t win against any class any more. That&#39;s
            what
            I was thinking.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unintentional tears trickled down Ichinose&#39;s cheeks. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Can&#39;t win? I thought you were just going to move forward without
            hesitation
            in your own way?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;But because of that...&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hesitating to speak, Ichinose spinned her words. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s, that&#39;s right. But... the results aren&#39;t coming. Our
            class
            is definitely getting further away from A class. That is obvious to everyone.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So you&#39;re thinking about the reason for that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;If I could direct my classmates like Sakayanagi-san. If I could lead as
            strongly as Ryuen-kun. If I could cooperate with others like Horikita-san... I can&#39;t help
            but think
            about all that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s pining for what you don&#39;t have. You can only be yourself;

            can&#39;t be anyone else.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Pining for something I don&#39;t have. Yep, that&#39;s right. I... want

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ichinose is looking for change. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whether it is right or wrong is secondary to the fact that she is struggling to
            break
            through. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Normally, this wouldn&#39;t be the place for me to reach out to her. But the
            confession I received from Ichinose on the uninhabited island led to several unexpected events
            for us as
            well, which is the main reason why she has been weakened up until now.</span></p>

            all !
            It sure was for me. Anyways, this volume was great even without any special exams. All the
            insights into
            characters and future events has hyped me a lot for the next ones. Speaking of which&hellip; The
            Next Volume
            is Classroom of the Elite Volume 0! Which would be, for sure, one of the best. Ah&hellip; I
            can&rsquo;t wait
            for it! There&rsquo;s so little time left for it. It is supposed to be released on 23rd
            December, 2022. As
            for the Estimated time of translation, I would say it will remain the same. Since nothing much
            changes with
            this Volume. It will have around 300+ pages, which I believe would be finished in the same
            amount of time as
            Y2V8. I really Look forward to Volume 0 and for more updated information on it you can follow me
