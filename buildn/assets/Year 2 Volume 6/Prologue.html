    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <h2>The Monologue of Akito Miyake
    </h2>
    <p>I never once thought of myself as a special person.</p>
    <p>I guess I'm an average person with no special strengths or flaws.</p>
    <p>I've been going about my life as usual, simply coasting along.</p>
    <p>I've done some bad things from time to time, and I've done some kind things too in my own way.</p>
    <p>I'm not a good guy, and I'm not a bad guy either. If I were to evaluate myself, I would be that kind of person.
    </p>
    <p>Ever since I was born, I've been walking around as a human being who's neither good nor bad.</p>
    <p>However, It wasn't until I went to high school that this became more apparent.</p>
    <p>I just randomly started watching Archery and thought I'd give it a try to pass the time. It's like giving in to
        the flow, just going about your life as normal.</p>
    <p>I don't pay attention to the big things, and my daily life seems to repeat itself. It may be a boring routine,
        but I did it because I thought it would be easier. Perhaps because of this, I never made any friends in high
        school initially.</p>
    <p>I wasn't lonely at all, but an unexpected turn of circumstances led to me making some new friends.</p>
    <p>Keisei, Kiyotaka, Haruka, Airi.</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that there were only five of us, including myself, I felt strangely at ease in that little
        group.</p>
    <p>I had a feeling that the rest of our school life will be spent in a relaxed manner with the five of us.</p>
    <p>The environment around me may have changed, but I was still me. That was the only thing that I knew would never
        change.</p>
    <p>In spite of these expectations, one major change occurred.</p>
    <p class="center">'Loving Someone.'</p>
    <p>I have always thought of girls as cute and beautiful, but I never fell in love with any of them. I wonder when it
        started.</p>
    <p>I started to look at Haruka's profile frequently.</p>
    <p>And what made me sure was when during the unanimous special exam it was stated that Haruka would be expelled.</p>
    <p>There was a part of me that couldn't accept that we would be separated.</p>
    <p>Emotion, not logic, was the top priority for me at that time.</p>
    <p>I wanted to protect her, even if it meant abandoning Airi, a member of the group I cared about as much as she
        cared about me.</p>
    <p>I don't know if this feeling is acceptable.</p>
    <p>I gave priority to what I wanted to protect by all means rather than what was right or wrong.</p>
    <p>But I have no regrets.</p>
    <p>"Will you join me in my revenge?"</p>
    <p>The sound brought me back to reality. Her eyes looking at me are the same as always.</p>
    <p>Those were strong, straightforward, and dangerously presenceful.</p>
    <p>But she had a will of determination that was not clouded by a single speck of uncertainty.</p>
    <p>I didn't answer aloud.</p>
    <p>No, I couldn't.</p>
    <p>The revenge/vengeance will surely cause our friends and our classmates a lot of trouble.</p>
    <p>She must have seen through my emotions, because she smiles and walks away, turning her back to me.</p>
    <p>In the past, I would have probably just sent her off without a second thought.</p>
    <p>The right thing to do is to forget it.</p>
    <p>Yes, how much easier it would be to just back off.</p>
    <p>I didn't know that falling in love with someone could be so tedious, difficult, and troublesome.</p>
    <p>I'mâ€¦ / Ore wa</p>
    <p>No matter how many people are going to hate it in the future.</p>
    <p>My emotions would not allow me to let her go alone.</p>
    <p>On this day, after the Sports festival, I made an impossible decision.</p>
