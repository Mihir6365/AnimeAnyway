    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
    <h2>An Agreement</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
        I came here to listen to the rest of yesterday's story at a karaoke room in the Keyaki Mall.
    </p>
    <p>Certainly this is one of the best places to have the most private space, with the exception of the
        dorms.
    </p>
    <p>When we stepped into the room, there was no one in sight except for me and Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>"Why come all the way to the karaoke room if we just need to talk?"
    </p>
    <p>We've been in each other's rooms in the past, so it's okay to talk in either room.
    </p>
    <p>In other words, the fact that she chose this location means that someone else is also coming
        here.
    </p>
    <p>Let's not go too deep and just leave it to Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>"Since We've got a little time before our scheduled time… do you want to sing?"
    </p>
    <p>She takes a microphone that was on the table and holds it out to me.
    </p>
    <p>"No, thank you. Why don't you take up singing? At the very least, I'll assist you with it."
    </p>
    <p>"No."
    </p>
    <p>Immediate denial.
    </p>
    <p>Why encourage people to do things you yourself don't want to do…
        "Because I'll study."
    </p>
    <p>She calmly took out her notebook and began studying with her own reference book after saying
        so.
    </p>
    <p>While many school courses now employ tablets and other technology, it is still probably easier to
        learn independently by accessing books and notebooks directly.
    </p>
    <p>When the song isn't playing, the room is fairly silent. Despite the weird mood created by the
        strange discussion, I chose to sit quietly on the sofa and wait for the time to pass.
    </p>
    <p>Then the time passed 5:10 pm.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita sighed as she looked up from her phone, which she had been checking every few
        minutes since before 5:00.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm sorry. This may turn out to be longer than I thought."
    </p>
    <p>I didn't ask who we were meeting with, but I can assume that they were confirmed to come late,
    </p>
    <p>although the meeting time was 5:00.
    </p>
    <p>The fact that she did not contact them suggests that there were unavoidable circumstances, that
        they were unprofessional, or that they were deliberately late.
    </p>
    <p>I continually thought of and eliminated numerous students, then waited another 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>An outsider carefully opened the door to the room, which had remained still for some time.
    </p>
    <p>The person who showed up was someone I had not expected to see.
    </p>
    <p>It was Kohei Katsuragi, a second-year D class student.
    </p>
    <p>At first glance, he seemed to be very punctual which is why I was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry I'm late."
    </p>
    <p>"No, I don't mind. You must have gone through a lot, too. Katsuragi-kun."
    </p>
    <p>"Well… Somewhat."
    </p>
    <p>Muttering so, Katsuragi urged the person behind him to enter the room.
    </p>
    <p>Another person shows up.
    </p>
    <p>"Suzune, it's nice that you want a date with me, but it looks like you have a lot of extra people."
    </p>
    <p>It was Ryuen Kakeru, the man who pulled Katsuragi, once the leader of Class A, out of his own
        class.
    </p>
    <p>"Because it would be difficult for me to have a constructive conversation with you alone."
    </p>
    <p>Despite his mocking smile, Ryuen shows no sign of relaxing his keen observation of Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita has regained her usual composure now that the Kushida situation has been resolved
        and the distractions have been gone, and since there has been minimal direct Confrontation
        since going up to second grade, it is not surprising that he detects a change in Horikita even at
        this level.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm curious if you were deliberately late in order to gain a psychological advantage?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know. I wonder about that..."
    </p>
    <p>They started exploring, checking, and fighting each other even before they came together. I
        can only assume that Ryuen has not yet been told the reason why they were called here.
    </p>
    <p>"You said you wanted to talk... let’s hear the details."
    </p>
    <p>"Can you have a seat? If it was just for a minute or two I wouldn’t bother to call you out here."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen gave me a quick glance, but sat down proudly on the sofa, grabbed the charging tablet
        and began to operate it, completing his order normally, and then tossing it messily onto the
        table.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita notices this and reaches for the tablet to pick it up.
    </p>
    <p>"Katsuragi-kun, is there anything you would like to order?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'll have some oolong tea."
    </p>
    <p>After listening and completing the order, she puts the tablet back at it's charging position.
    </p>
    <p>"I’ll tell you why I called you here…"
    </p>
    <p>She was ready to begin when Ryuen abruptly stopped her with a hand, as if to discourage her.
    </p>
    <p>"Before that, I had a question for you. How does it feel to be rewarded with class points for
        cutting off a classmate who is slowing you down? Is it as good as it sounds?"
    </p>
    <p>He wasn't afraid to ask her a potentially damaging question..
    </p>
    <p>It's a way of trying to gain the upper hand when he doesn't even know what we're going to say
        yet.
    </p>
    <p>It's clear that Ryuuen was using his classmates to figure out what went on in our class in the
        exam.
    </p>
    <p>It was a move based on the assumption that the internal affairs problem was still unresolved, but
        Horikita beside me was unaffected.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not like It didn't cause problems in doing so. But, I'm afraid, it's not going to work out the
        way you wish. Most of the big problems have already been solved."
    </p>
    <p>That’s a lie.
    </p>
    <p>Even though some problems have been solved, the issue regarding Haruka is still unsolved,
    </p>
    <p>and it is uncertain when it might explode.
    </p>
    <p>"For a liar, you're rather bold, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen thinks that it is a lie, but Horikita does not care.
    </p>
    <p>"Do whatever you want if you think I'm lying. You're not the type of person who believes
        everything I say to begin with, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I don’t know. Maybe I trust you more than you think."
    </p>
    <p>"It’s not funny, whether you mean it or whether you’re joking."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita dodges his provocations.
    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi slowly crosses his arms, his gaze falling on Horikita as if he was analyzing her.
    </p>
    <p>"What was the matter with you? I thought you were going to expel someone."
    </p>
    <p>Horkita asked Ryuen.
    </p>
    <p>"Aren’t you concerned about not having anyone around? Because you're almost certainly the
        only one who made a bad decision."
    </p>
    <p>Three out of four classes protected their classmates.
    </p>
    <p>He attempts to give the impression that Horikita was the only one who made the wrong,
    </p>
    <p>careless decision.
    </p>
    <p>"It’s too bad we were the only ones who chose the right answer, because we did get a step
        ahead in the Class A competition."
    </p>
    <p>"That’s enough for the moment."
    </p>
    <p>As Katsuragi restrained Ryuen, there was a light knock at the door of the room. The waiter
        showed up and brought out the oolong tea and orange juice that was ordered. The drinks were
        placed in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita and Katsuragi’s gazes were caught by this strange combination.
    </p>
    <p>As it happens, so did mine.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen and orange juice... don’t match each other.
    </p>
    <p>"So, What's the purpose of this meeting?"
    </p>
    <p>While everyone was poking around in their minds, Katsuragi encouraged Horikita to start the
        conversation.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita nodded, and then began to speak, looking at both Ryuen and Katsuragi.
    </p>
    <p>"In order to defeat Sakayanagi’s class, I propose a cooperative relationship at the next sports
        festival."
    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi reacts with a slight shoulder reaction, indicating surprise. Immediately after, he
        returned to his usual manner and asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean by... cooperative relationship?"
    </p>
    <p>The word 'Cooperation' can be perceived in very different ways
        It was only natural for him to want to know the specifics, but he had no intention of denying the
        proposal carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen, on the other hand, was not surprised, nor did he seem impressed.
    </p>
    <p>He was just observing with a smirk on his face.
    </p>
    <p>"This special test has aspects of both competition among all students and by grade. I’m trying to
        make the most of a system that allows you to score equally if you win a group competition played
        by multiple people."
    </p>
    <p>"Why our class in particular? Do you mind if I ask that?"
    </p>
    <p>The class leader, Ryuen, did not speak at all, and isn’t making a move to interrupt it.
    </p>
    <p>"First of all, it goes without saying that Class A is out of the question. It’s not worth it if we’re
        giving points to the target class that we should be catching up with. The two choices that remain
        are Ichinose-san’s class or Ryuen-kun and Katsuragi-kun’s class. I would say that Ichinose-san
        is the most trustworthy, but it’s hard to say that many of her students have excellent physical
        abilities."
    </p>
    <p>"So you’re saying you chose us by process of elimination."
    </p>
    <p>"If it were a simple process of elimination, I wouldn’t have teamed up with any class in the first
        place. The one person I don’t trust more than Sakayanagi-san is you, Ryuen-kun."
    </p>
    <p>He's certainly not an easy person to work with.
    </p>
    <p>As if sympathizing, Katsuragi also nodded deeply.
    </p>
    <p>"Indeed, even I, who have now joined the class, believe so. There is no one I am more afraid to
        entrust my back to. So then why did you take such a great risk by proposing a cooperative
        relationship?"
    </p>
    <p>"To win of course, we can’t win without stopping Class A’s dominance."
    </p>
    <p>"But what’s the point if that doesn't happen? This man, Ryuen, will go to any lengths because
        that is the type of person he is. I know this because I’ve been there myself. I wouldn’t
        recommend it."
    </p>
    <p>He expresses harsh opinions about Ryuen to the extent that he does not seem to be the chief
        strategist of Ryuen’s class.
    </p>
    <p>If we join forces carelessly, we will be swallowed up by Ryuen’s class, rather than beating Class
        A.
    </p>
    <p>He warns us of the dangers.
    </p>
    <p>"I wasn't going to get right to the point in today's discussion. The most crucial thing to keep in
        mind is that you cannot trust someone who is consistently late and inconsiderate. But When I
        watched Katsuragi-kun apologizing for being late, I changed my mind. At the very least, I have
        faith in you."
    </p>
    <p>"That's naive thinking. Don’t you think this attitude of mine is also a trick by Ryuen?"
    </p>
    <p>"If I can’t seem to see past the trustworthiness, then sooner or later I’m just going to get
        swallowed up."
    </p>
    <p>This is probably the best bet for Horikita here.
    </p>
    <p>If you put Ryuen and Katsuragi side by side, Katsuragi would appear to be a relatively sensible
        and good person.
    </p>
    <p>But if Ryuen has already come here with a plan in mind, Katsuragi has no choice but to follow
        his orders.
    </p>
    <p>"You look a little different from before, Horikita. You’re growing up."
    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi senses a change in Horikita, a growth, and is once again ready to resume the
        conversation.
    </p>
    <p>"I understand your side of the story. Let me give you my personal opinion from here."
    </p>
    <p>He added the word 'personal' which means that Ryuen's intentions and thoughts were not taken
        into consideration.
    </p>
    <p>"I also had a plan in mind to join forces with your class this time and take down Class A."
    </p>
    <p>"You too…?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. Your class has talented players beyond our grade level, such as Sudo and koenji, who are
        at the top of the physical ability in all of the four classes of the second year. There is no need to
        worry about them being dragged down by their peers. You’re not someone we can trust
        unconditionally, but we’re also not a class you can easily betray, which isn’t a bad factor either."
    </p>
    <p>Next to Katsuragi, Ryuen’s eyes were fixed on me, but his mouth remained closed.
    </p>
    <p>Because no one else was available to undertake negotiations, Ryuen has always taken the lead
        in dialogue. However, with the addition of Katsuragi, the need for this has diminished and the
        option to wait and see has been created. This is a very big positive factor.
    </p>
    <p>It's uncanny not knowing what Ryuen would think, what he will propose, or when he will propose
        it..
    </p>
    <p>While it is easy to talk to Katsuragi, Horikita is probably becoming more aware of such concerns.
    </p>
    <p>But it is a path that cannot be avoided if discussions are to be brought up regularly over the next
        18 months.
    </p>
    <p>"But in practice, it was 50/50 whether Ryuen would approach with a proposal for cooperation."
    </p>
    <p>It has been more than a week since the details of the sports festival were announced. If they
        were to move on the basis of cooperation, it would not be surprising if such talk had already
        reached the ears of Horikita. In other words, the other half of Katsuragi’s priority was not to join
        hands.
    </p>
    <p>"When it comes to co-operation, we will naturally have to secure first and second place in our
        class. When that happens, inevitably the overall strength of the class is what decides the
        winner. If we just look at simple probabilities, we are willing to accept the possibility that
        Horikita’s class will come first and ours will come second."
    </p>
    <p>By working together to outsmart Sakayanagi and Ichinose classes, a Horikita class versus
        Ryuen class situation is created..
    </p>
    <p>That is why Katsuragi answered that it was 50-50; because he could foresee it.
    </p>
    <p>Even though Katsuragi is a good communicator, it doesn't mean that he would agree to a
        cooperative relationship.
    </p>
    <p>If we don't get over the hurdle in front of us, we won't be able to start negotiations with Ryuuen..
    </p>
    <p>"So our class is seen as a threat to yours."
    </p>
    <p>"Of course, things have changed dramatically since a year ago. You are now in Class B, as
        opposed to Class D a year ago, when you were mocked as a bunch of defectives. And that's
        after losing all of your class points. Also, You recently gained 100 class points by cutting off one
        of your classmates in the unanimous special test, in addition to Koenji's single victory in the
        uninhabited island special exam. There's no denying that you're formidable opponents."
    </p>
    <p>"It’s not my achievement, but I don’t feel bad that you think that way. But if we don’t co-operate
        and we go to the sports festival separately, the worst case scenario is that Sakayanagi-san’s
        class will win first place. The important thing is to defeat Sakayanagi-san’s class. Am I wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>"Indeed. That is also true. Ryuen, what do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>Here, for the first time, Katsuragi asked Ryuen for his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>"You'll offer me something in return if you want my aid, right?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'm wondering if you misinterpreted something. Although I was the one who presented the idea,
    </p>
    <p>this does not imply that I must pay for it. Rather, you should recognise that you are in a position
        to form a cooperative connection with the first-place candidates class."
    </p>
    <p>"Don’t make me laugh. I’m in a position where I could win without your help, but if you ask me to
        help you, I can lend you a hand. If you don’t like it, there's no point staying here."
    </p>
    <p>"Do you know how to get back? Go out that door, turn left and you’ll be heading the right way."
    </p>
    <p>Without needing to consider any kind of concession, Horikita urges Ryuen and Katsuragi to
        leave.
    </p>
    <p>This attitude is the core of negotiating, but at the same time, Horikita gives off the impression
        that she is not betting everything on this strategy.
    </p>
    <p>The proposal to defeat Sakayanagi together still stands. In other words, negotiations will break
        down when Ryuen leaves the table.
    </p>
    <p>The situation will be different if Ryuen again says that he is willing to join forces.
    </p>
    <p>"You’ve got some balls for a bluff."
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean? Our class is a reasonably competent class in the sports festival, as
        Katsuragi-kun stated. Do you believe you have what it takes to beat Sudo-kun and Koenji-kun in
        a head-to-head battle?"
    </p>
    <p>"If we face them honestly and head on, maybe not. But there are plenty of other ways to do it.
    </p>
    <p>It's not like you've forgotten what happened last year, right?"
    </p>
    <p>This is exactly what I was expecting, a dirty trick by Ryuen, disguised as an accident.
    </p>
    <p>It is obvious that this is what he was trying to say..
    </p>
    <p>"This year there will be several guests, and the rules of the sports festival, by it's very nature,
    </p>
    <p>will be closely monitored. Let’s see how sneaky you can be this time."
    </p>
    <p>"There are plenty of blind spots. And it isn’t only limited to during competitions."
    </p>
    <p>This means places that are unsupervised, such as changing rooms and washrooms.
    </p>
    <p>"So you're still the same huh…, and your thinking is certainly threatening, but… I have already
        seen that far."
    </p>
    <p>Undiscouraged, Horikita slammed the notebook shut.
    </p>
    <p>"Ayanokoji-kun. Thank you for accompanying me today. It seems that this case is too risky for
        me to ask your judgment. I think I’ll call it a night here."
    </p>
    <p>"If you’re okay with that, then there’s no problem."
    </p>
    <p>That’s where Horikita left it and started to put the notebook away.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen saw this and made no response, but Katsuragi made a move.
    </p>
    <p>"Ryuen. Apparently, Horikita is even more different than we imagined so far. If we don’t get to
        the negotiating table properly, it’s us who will be cut off."
    </p>
    <p>Having calmly analyzed the situation, Katsuragi turns his gaze once again to Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>"You didn't bring this up with me because you saw the downside of teaming up with me?"
    </p>
    <p>"We never suggested it. But when Horikita had talked to us, the situation changed. Besides, I
        had a feeling that it would exceed my expectations."
    </p>
    <p>The updated data they attained has resulted in a slight increase in Horikita's class's evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>In other words, they re-evaluated the class to be suitable for cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>"I’m bluffing, but that’s all from my point of view. It’s natural to try to spin things to your
        advantage. I've improved my communication skills, but the only reason it appears to be working
        for you is because Ayanokoji is by your side."
    </p>
    <p>With that said, Ryuen picked up the glass of orange juice in front of him and sprinkled all the
        contents toward me without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>By sidestepping from my seated position, I was able to avoid getting hit and evade the attack. A
        large yellow stain spreads and fragrances the place where I had been sitting until just before.
    </p>
    <p>"You’ve noticed how crazy he is, haven’t you? I wonder if you could have dodged that one?"
    </p>
    <p>"... I don't think so."
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah. A normal person would be soaking wet before they could even react. Most people can’t
        avoid it, but he just looks at you like everything's normal and looks unconcerned."
    </p>
    <p>"He has a hell of a reflex, sure, but... what does that have to do with this discussion?"
    </p>
    <p>"Don't you get it? Ayanokoji is the Ace of your class, Suzune, and if you ask me. It’s no wonder
        you’ve got a big mouth when you’re showing off your weapon to an unarmed opponent."
    </p>
    <p>"Did you go out of your way to ask for orange juice to do this? Give me a break."
    </p>
    <p>I also thought it was odd, but he’s the guy who does the most crazy things. It was
        right to remain conscious of the untouched drink.
    </p>
    <p>"Why did you dodge? If you had taken it all from the front, we could have silenced his
        response."
    </p>
    <p>"Don’t be absurd. I don’t want to be covered in juice."
    </p>
    <p>It smells awful, it’s sticky and it doesn’t come off. It is a hassle to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>If this had been oolong tea, I could have perhaps been tolerant.
    </p>
    <p>Orange juice is probably one of the best drinks to spray on someone for
        harassment.
    </p>
    <p>"If you want to negotiate properly, first remove Ayanokoji from the room. Then we can talk."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen Offers to continue negotiations on condition that I am removed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>"That sounds like something you’d say. But I refuse. He’s my classmate. He has the right to be
        present and I asked him to be present. I don’t see what’s wrong with using the weapons you
        have to negotiate."
    </p>
    <p>She's really courageous. Another thought was that Horikita has obtained information about
        Ryuen and I without our knowledge. Ryuen also sensed this.
    </p>
    <p>The extent is unknown, but it would not be surprising if she heard about the rooftop incident
        involving Kei.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita told me that she does not need my help and only needs me to be present from the
        beginning.
    </p>
    <p>I can’t complain because she is just using me while keeping her promise.
    </p>
    <p>"My class, which is in an advantageous position, is offering to enter into a cooperation. If that
        doesn’t convince you, then you can pretend that this whole thing never really happened."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen will never cooperate with Sakayanagi. Even if they approached Ichinose, it is unclear
        how much helpful power they would be able to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>A wrong decision here will inevitably have an impact on the future for Ryuen. It is even possible,
    </p>
    <p>although unlikely, that a Horikita-Sakayanagi alliance could be formed.
    </p>
    <p>This is because it is not a bad outcome if Horikita’s class comes first and Sakayanagi’s class
        comes second in the results.
    </p>
    <p>But allowing this to happen would make it more difficult to pursue Sakayanagi.
    </p>
    <p>"Depending on the discussion, I would be willing to join forces with your class. Now, may I hear
        your response, take it or leave it?"
    </p>
    <p>The next response was left to the leader, Ryuen, rather than Katsuragi.
    </p>
    <p>After a few seconds of silence, Ryuen makes a decision.
    </p>
    <p>"Fine, I’ll take you up on that offer."
    </p>
    <p>He replied, but Ryuen’s words did not stop there.
    </p>
    <p>"However, I will put a condition. Because the relationship between us should be stronger and
        more equal. There will be a 100-point differential in class points gained if either my class or
        yours, in no particular sequence, achieves the goal of first or second place. To make up the
        difference, the winner will give the loser private points, which will be distributed until March 1,
    </p>
    <p>the day before graduation. Add this condition."
    </p>
    <p>He is trying to do the same thing as last year’s uninhabited island exam when Ryuen signed a
        contract with Kasturagi for private points.
    </p>
    <p>If one side gets more class points, the difference should be made up with private points.
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen must be well aware of his disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>He is aware of this and is attempting to stress it in order to gain an advantage, but Horikita is
        also aware of it..
    </p>
    <p>"Surely those terms themselves are equal. But I refuse. It is a serious competition as to who will
        take first or second place. We will only settle it after a fair fight."
    </p>
    <p>If they were equal, with or without conditions, there would be no conditions as long as they were
        judged to have a good chance of winning.
    </p>
    <p>"Kuku. I’m not going to let you take everything for yourself, am I? But that doesn’t make it any
        better for us."
    </p>
    <p>"It is difficult to extract concessions from Horikita. I think we’re about to tie our hands on a firm
        deal."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen is not yet ready to formally sign a contract but Katsuragi shows a flexible attitude towards
        it.
    </p>
    <p>"That’s not enough. If you’re going to ask me to help you, you’re going to have to show me more
        sincerity."
    </p>
    <p>"Sincerity? Isn’t it the same for me? If the strategy brings us to the top and brings Sakayanagi’s
        Class A to the bottom, it will be minus 150 points for them. There is plenty of room to consider
        this strategy of cooperation. But, we’re taking a risk here, too."
    </p>
    <p>As if to rebut, Horikita continues.
    </p>
    <p>"The doubt that has been swirling around me all along. It’s whether or not I can trust you. If we
        focus our main forces on team competitions in order to form a strong team, it is inevitable that
        the individual competitions will be neglected."
    </p>
    <p>It is quite possible that Ryuen will instruct his class to betray and cut corners in the competition,
    </p>
    <p>or even not show up for the promised competition in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>It is doubtful that all the competitions will be monitored, as Horikita and the others will be busy in
        different competitions on the day of the event.
    </p>
    <p>Also it is not allowed to bring cell phones or other devices, so they cannot coordinate from
        different places.
    </p>
    <p>"Trusting you, who is untrustworthy. Taking that risk is the maximum concession and
        cooperation we can offer. We will not concede a single millimeter more."
    </p>
    <p>This is something that Ryuen has to hear.
    </p>
    <p>Even if there is an attractive competitive force in the class, Ryuen cannot be trusted, and that is
        the basic premise of the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita is saying that she will accept it despite that, and that they should cooperate without
        saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>"You're right. I had no trust in your way. I guess we'll just have to accept it here."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not looking for you to trust me."
    </p>
    <p>While laughing it off, Ryuen still relaxed his shoulders, as if he was convinced by Horikita’s
        words.
    </p>
    <p>"Can you really trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>"The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I’ll take the word for it, a handy phrase invented by our
        forefathers."
    </p>
    <p>It's hard to reach your full potential in an alliance when you still have lingering doubts. In some
        cases, you may find yourself focusing your attention more on your back than fighting with the
        enemy.
    </p>
    <p>"I don’t approve of everything you say, but one thing is for sure, it’s not a good idea to keep
        letting the Sakayanagi class take the lead."
    </p>
    <p>To Ryuen’s remark, both Katsuragi and Horikita agreed, nodding their heads without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>To allow Class A to win. That is an act that, no matter what, cannot be allowed any longer.
    </p>
    <p>"Even though we have a direct confrontation with them coming up at the end of the school year,
    </p>
    <p>we won’t be able to overturn the class points with just one of those."
    </p>
    <p>In the meantime, they want to be within range. The idea seems believable.
    </p>
    <p>"I’ve had you listen to me in silence, but it’s time for me to hear your opinion, Ayanokoji-kun."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita’s idea, its risk.
    </p>
    <p>Objectively, do I accept this strategy or not?
    </p>
    <p>"Cooperation in interest is not a bad thing. There might be some objections, but I think everyone
        will understand that it's important to defeat Sakayanagi. I’m sure Yosuke and Kei will follow up on
        this."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita is once again confident in her idea. But Ryuen stopped.
    </p>
    <p>"I’d like to make a contract, but not yet."
    </p>
    <p>"Still? Do you think you can extract any more concessions?"
    </p>
    <p>"Let me check one last thing. Was it you, Suzune, who brought up this proposal? Or was it
        Ayanokoji who was observing the situation silently? Which is it?"
    </p>
    <p>He seemed to be quite interested in learning who came up with the idea.
    </p>
    <p>"If it was not initiated by Ayanokoji-kun, would you accept this? There seems to be a relationship
        between you and Ayanokoji-kun that you can’t let anyone else hear about."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita seems to be implying something when she says that.
    </p>
    <p>"I know firsthand that you recognize each other’s abilities as enemies. And that I’m out of place."
    </p>
    <p>"Did I say anything about that? I’m just asking you to answer who came up with the idea."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen, somewhat irritated, hurried his words to Horikita in the form of a glare.
    </p>
    <p>"It’s me. I only asked Ayanokoji-kun to be present this time, and I didn’t even let him hear about
        it until we talked about it here."
    </p>
    <p>If I was the one suggesting the idea, Ryuen might refuse.
    </p>
    <p>When Horikita speaks honestly, Ryuen laughs.
    </p>
    <p>"I see. I’m relieved to hear that. If that’s the case, I’ll accept your proposal."
    </p>
    <p>That was the deciding factor, and Ryuen formally accepted to join forces.
    </p>
    <p>"Why?"
    </p>
    <p>"Why? I don’t know. You’ll have to figure out why yourself."
    </p>
    <p>He dodges the answer.
    </p>
    <p>"It would be better for both of us to have a proper contract in place, just in case. No, especially
        for you."
    </p>
    <p>"Of course I will. I’m going to have Chabashira-sensei, and Sakagami-sensei in between."
    </p>
    <p>The contract is based on the involvement of the faculty. It would naturally include consequences
        of breach of contract in it.
    </p>
    <p>Even if it is Ryuen, there is nothing that can be done if it is bound by rules that cannot be
        broken.
    </p>
    <p>"Then, I will leave the preparation of the documents to Horikita. Is that alright with you?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. Can I have you and I look it over together a few times, Katsuragi-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>When Katsuragi checks Ryuen with a glance, he replied with a face saying,
    </p>
    <p>"Do what you want."
    </p>
    <p>Katsuragi’s presence is really significant in Ryuen’s class, where trust is important. He is
        smart, trustworthy, and able to express his opinions to Ryuen without any hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>The degree to which Ryuen entrusted Katsuragi and the way he selected him, was nothing short
        of brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>It was truly worth the large sum of money that was spent to bring him in.
    </p>
    <p>"Okay. Let’s formally exchange a written agreement and then work together in the sports
        festival."
    </p>
    <p>Thus, it was decided that Horikita’s class and Ryuen’s class would fight together in the sports
        festival.
    </p>
    <p>The goal is to prioritize the victory of the class and aim for cooperation within it.
    </p>
    <p>However, this was not the end of the story, and Katsuragi changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>"It is good that we have reached an agreement to cooperate with each other, but then there are
        some things we should think about. It is quite conceivable that Sakayanagi and Ichinose could
        join forces, but what do you intend to do about that?"
    </p>
    <p>An alliance against an alliance.
    </p>
    <p>That development would be quite possible.
    </p>
    <p>"No problem. Even if Ichinose cooperates with Sakayanagi in this sports festival, our unity is
        better. Besides, Sakayanagi would have to give up even the third place. Just as you feared
        second place when you teamed up, Ichinose would have the advantage if they teamed up as
        well. Sakayanagi’s class has 38 members due to the withdrawal of Yahiko and the transfer of
        Katsuragi. With Sakayanagi’s non-participation also confirmed, there are 37 members in the
        class. Ichinose’s class has 40 students, a surprisingly large difference of 3 students."
    </p>
    <p>The athletic ability of both classes are almost even. If this is the case, the difference in the
        number of three classmates may determine the winner.
    </p>
    <p>"But it’s Sakayanagi, she’ll come up with a strategy to just cover the number of people."
    </p>
    <p>"Didn’t you see the rules this time? When you don’t participate in the festival, you’re on standby
        at your dormitory. And since you can’t even use your cell phone, that means the A-class is
        completely nonfunctional."
    </p>
    <p>"Of course I read the rules. It is true that Sakayanagi cannot participate due to her physical
        condition. However, she can formally participate and earn a total of 10 points, 5 points from her
        score and 5 points from the participation prize. Once she meets the minimum requirements, she
        can continue to stay and send instructions."
    </p>
    <p>"Sakayanagi, who has a high pride, can't do it."
    </p>
    <p>As long as she is unable to compete satisfactorily in any event, it is inevitable that Sakayanagi
        will be the only one to stand out.
    </p>
    <p>"Not so conveniently. Abstention from competition is a given right. If you participate formally and
        then abstain, there is no shame in it."
    </p>
    <p>"Does this fall under a compelling reason? If you’re participating with an understanding of your
        own physical condition, you’re required to justify it. She'd have to finish the 100-meter race with
        a cane in her hand when everyone else has finished running. I don’t think she’d make such a
        spectacle of herself."
    </p>
    <p>"Certainly, normally she would not participate because of her personality. However, if she knew
        that we had teamed up with each other, Sakayanagi would consider the risk of losing on
        purpose to give out commands on the field. I’m saying that it’s a problem to assume her
        absence will be a sure thing. You are saying this lightly, but give me a probability that she will
        not participate. Give me a serious answer."
    </p>
    <p>"Ninety percent."
    </p>
    <p>"90% based on your baseless assessment. If that’s the case, the appropriate value is even
        lower. 70% to 80% at best."
    </p>
    <p>"You should be happy with that number."
    </p>
    <p>"That won't do. If we want to be certain, it should be at least 95%."
    </p>
    <p>Forgetting about us, Ryuen and Katsuragi engaged in a debate.
    </p>
    <p>"That’s absurd. But if you want to be more sure, there is a way. I’ll thoroughly hang up with
        Sakayagi before the sports festival. Telling her that If she participates, the whole class will mock
        her during the competition. That way we can reach the 95% you’re talking about."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen says she will give in to the threat of trampling on personal dignity.
    </p>
    <p>"That’s not acceptable from an ethical standpoint."
    </p>
    <p>"I agree. I don’t think the school will stand by idly and watch."
    </p>
    <p>Both Horikita and Katsuragi denied that they would accept such things.
    </p>
    <p>"If Sakayanagi ever joins, I'll crush her."
    </p>
    <p>"Remember, we are in the lower classes because it’s not easy to crush Sakayanagi-san."
    </p>
    <p>If Sakayanagi were to function as a leader during this sports festival, it would certainly be
        difficult to predict what kind of moves Class A would make.
    </p>
    <p>Whether she participates or not will have a significant impact on the outcome of this sports
        festival.
    </p>
    <p>If we can ensure the absence of Sakayanagi, it means that victory is at hand.
    </p>
    <p>"Horikita. Are you including my contribution to the class victory?"
    </p>
    <p>"I basically tried not to think about it. You're the only one who remains in a special position."
    </p>
    <p>"That’s convenient to hear. If the presence or absence of Sakayanagi’s participation is hindering
        the cooperation, I may be able to help."
    </p>
    <p>"What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>Interested, Katsuragi stopped talking to Ryuen and turned around.
    </p>
    <p>"If you leave it to me, I’ll make sure Sakayanagi doesn’t participate in the sports festival."
    </p>
    <p>"What......?"
    </p>
    <p>"Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>Horikita shows surprise, and Ryuen seems impressed. And Katsuragi continues to listen in
        silence.
    </p>
    <p>"However, for making sure Sakayanagi does not participate, I don’t want you to rely on a single
        point from me at the sports festival. Not just Horikita, but you too Ryuen."
    </p>
    <p>"I didn’t include you in my calculations from the beginning. If you can stop Sakayanagi, it will
        save us a lot of trouble."
    </p>
    <p>"I can’t even imagine what you will do, but if Ryuen and Horikita believe in what Ayanokoji has
        said and leave it to him, I have no intention of saying anything more about this matter. If
        Sakayanagi is not participating, it won’t be hard to bring Class A to the bottom."
    </p>
    <p>"But can you really do that?"
    </p>
    <p>"Oh. There’s a good chance you’ll get it without me doing anything, but you can leave it to me.
    </p>
    <p>And I’ve been thinking, it’s not every day that Horikita and Ryuen get together and cooperate
        with each other like this, is it? There’s something else I need to talk to you about, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>I was thinking a little differently than the three of them during this discussion.
    </p>
    <p>"What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>As I begin to share my suggestions, Horikita and Katsuragi look at each other and Ryuen listens
        in silence.
    </p>
    <p>As soon as I finished my explanation, the ice in Katsuragi’s glass melted and clinked.
    </p>
    <p>"That’s an interesting idea, but…"
    </p>
    <p>Horikita looks at Ryuen, perplexed, unsure if he would accept it or not.
    </p>
    <p>"It’s certainly not impossible according to the rules. But…"
    </p>
    <p>"You don’t like my proposal?"
    </p>
    <p>Even for the agreement related to the sports festival, if it had been a proposal from me, there is
        a possibility that he would have refused.
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, I don’t like it. I reject it."
    </p>
    <p>Ryuen had denied it, but Katsuragi interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>"Your personal feelings can wait. It’s honestly not a bad idea. We may have to go over the details
        and the rules again, but no, we're talking about Ayanokoji’s plan. I’m sure he’s made sure of
        that."
    </p>
    <p>"There is no problem with the rules. We can make a more powerful development if we have
        students from Ryuen’s class cooperate with us rather than just our class. Don’t you agree?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, sure."
    </p>
    <p>Horikita is well aware of the issues we're dealing with right now. We can relieve some of the
        stress if we can get help from somewhere else..
    </p>
    <p>"Take it on, Ryuen. We should now proceed with preparations for a direct confrontation with
        Sakayanagi."
    </p>
    <p>"Listen, Ayanokoji. After crushing Sakayanagi, you’re next."
    </p>
    <p>"If you reach that point, it’s inevitable."
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps those words were decisive, as Ryuen also accepted my proposal.
    </p>
    <p>"Katsuragi, you're in charge. Start preparing"
    </p>
    <p>"I will."
    </p>
    <p>"That’s exactly what a war with Class A is all about."
    </p>
    <p>"The first objective, however, is to keep Sakayanagi out of the sports festival. Because without
        completing this initial step, neither the partnership at the sports festival nor the proposal from
        Ayanokoji can begin."
    </p>
    <p>"I know. Just leave it to me."
    </p>
    <p>I have a strategy for holding off Sakayanagi that neither Ryuen, Katsuragi, nor Horikita have.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
        Just before 7 p.m. Sakayanagi, Kamuro, and Hashimoto of the 2nd year class A were gathered
        at a cafe in the Keyaki Mall.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not surprised to be called out of the blue, but what can I do for you today, Princess?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'd like to talk about the sports festival about what we should be doing."
    </p>
    <p>"I thought you said you had a plan for it right?"
    </p>
    <p>"The situation changes from moment to moment. And today, another new change has taken
        place."
    </p>
    <p>Saying so, Sakayanagi continues.
    </p>
    <p>"Ryuen-kun's class and Horikita-san's class have made contact."
    </p>
    <p>Hearing this, Hashimoto's eyes widened.
    </p>
    <p>"Which one of them approached the other? Did Ryuen approach Horikita?"
    </p>
    <p>"That is unknown. But either way, it is safe to assume that the two are connected."
    </p>
    <p>"Wait a minute. I don't think it's going to work out that easily. I don't think Horikita will trust Ryuen
        so easily. He's not someone you can ally with."
    </p>
    <p>"You know what they say,
    </p>
    <p>'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'
    </p>
    <p>We are in a situation to be alone. They don’t have to trust each other, but as long as they have
        the same goals, they work well together."
    </p>
    <p>The possibility of the two classes joining forces is easily guessed by both.
    </p>
    <p>The news isn't good, and their expressions become more serious.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not good to go on like this, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"We can't beat them on our own?"
    </p>
    <p>"If we assume that the three classes were going to compete separately, there was still a chance
        for any of them to take any of the places, but the connection came from an unexpected source."
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi makes it clear and looks at Hashimoto.
    </p>
    <p>"One wouldn't join forces with Ryuen, though. You never know when you might get stabbed in
        the back."
    </p>
    <p>"Rather, it would be more convenient if he did… If Ryuen-kun’s class is in first place and
        Horikita-san’s class is in second place then I welcome the result, but if it’s the other way around,
    </p>
    <p>it’s a bit troublesome."
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi is more wary of Horikita's class than Ryuen.
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto's slight smile vanishes as a result of Sakayanagi's remark.
    </p>
    <p>"And there's no question that they're gaining momentum right now. I thought it was impossible
        for anyone but the class of Ryuen to expel someone and take 100 class points. Has Horikita
        grown up… or… Perhaps Ayanokoji is working from the Shadows?"
    </p>
    <p>He emphasizes Ayanokoji's name and directs it to Sakayanagi. As if to confirm something.
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi continues in an uncaring manner.
    </p>
    <p>"He's really stepped up his game lately, What's going on?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't think he's hiding anything more than his OAA. Well, Ayanokoji is not the only student like
        that."
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto quickly backed down, as it was not a good idea to provoke and get attention.
    </p>
    <p>"But what are you going to do? We'll lose without you, but you're going to be absent, right?"
    </p>
    <p>In other words, you're throwing away the Special exam? Kamuro poses the question.
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto, who had been smiling, seemed concerned about this point, and his expression
        hardened again.
    </p>
    <p>Minus 150 points. Even if Class A sank to the bottom, it would not cause much damage.
    </p>
    <p>The defeat, on the other hand, is not to be welcomed, as their current situation has been
        possible because of continuous wins.
    </p>
    <p>"There's only one answer."
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi laughs and continues.
    </p>
    <p>"I will also participate in the sports festival. Even if they really join hands, they are calculating
        that they can barely win combined with my non-participation. Let them know that this is an
        illusion."
    </p>
    <p>"Seriously? Will you be okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"I like that you're willing to do this, but are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>The two are concerned by Sakayanagi's announcement of participation.
    </p>
    <p>"Being made a spectacle of? I can get around it as I want."
    </p>
    <p>"Well, I'm sure you'll do fine. If you say you'll come out, then the outcome will be different."
    </p>
    <p>"It does not, however, boost overall athletic performance.It can only pick up the competition that
        we might miss out on. To put it another way, taking first position will be a difficult task for us."
    </p>
    <p>"I think it's enough that we won't be at the bottom."
    </p>
    <p>"It's not so difficult to crack the relationship between Horikita-san and Ryuen-kun. Let's deviate
        them on the day when they are desperately trying to work together."
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto and Kamuro have confidence in Sakayanagi, who has absolute confidence in them.
    </p>
    <p>It has produced high results time and again.
    </p>
    <p>"Well that's a relief, huh? Well, I’m surprised that you could pick up the information so quickly,
    </p>
    <p>Princess. You didn’t do it yourself, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>For everyday information gathering, she often used Hashimoto and Kamuro. But this time
        the two had never heard of it before, and Hashimoto asked curiously. "I’m still the Class A
        representative, and I’m getting to know some of the first-year students." Sakayanagi grinned
        softly, as though she was relishing the unexpected question
    </p>
    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <p>
        Just before 7 p.m. Sakayanagi, Kamuro, and Hashimoto of the 2nd year class A were gathered
        at a cafe in the Keyaki Mall.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm not surprised to be called out of the blue, but what can I do for you today, Princess?"
    </p>
    <p>"I'd like to talk about the sports festival about what we should be doing."
    </p>
    <p>"I thought you said you had a plan for it right?"
    </p>
    <p>"The situation changes from moment to moment. And today, another new change has taken
        place."
    </p>
    <p>Saying so, Sakayanagi continues.
    </p>
    <p>"Ryuen-kun's class and Horikita-san's class have made contact."
    </p>
    <p>Hearing this, Hashimoto's eyes widened.
    </p>
    <p>"Which one of them approached the other? Did Ryuen approach Horikita?"
    </p>
    <p>"That is unknown. But either way, it is safe to assume that the two are connected."
    </p>
    <p>"Wait a minute. I don't think it's going to work out that easily. I don't think Horikita will trust Ryuen
        so easily. He's not someone you can ally with."
    </p>
    <p>"You know what they say,
    </p>
    <p>'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'
    </p>
    <p>We are in a situation to be alone. They don’t have to trust each other, but as long as they have
        the same goals, they work well together."
    </p>
    <p>The possibility of the two classes joining forces is easily guessed by both.
    </p>
    <p>The news isn't good, and their expressions become more serious.
    </p>
    <p>"It's not good to go on like this, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>"We can't beat them on our own?"
    </p>
    <p>"If we assume that the three classes were going to compete separately, there was still a chance
        for any of them to take any of the places, but the connection came from an unexpected source."
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi makes it clear and looks at Hashimoto.
    </p>
    <p>"One wouldn't join forces with Ryuen, though. You never know when you might get stabbed in
        the back."
    </p>
    <p>"Rather, it would be more convenient if he did… If Ryuen-kun’s class is in first place and
        Horikita-san’s class is in second place then I welcome the result, but if it’s the other way around,
    </p>
    <p>it’s a bit troublesome."
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi is more wary of Horikita's class than Ryuen.
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto's slight smile vanishes as a result of Sakayanagi's remark.
    </p>
    <p>"And there's no question that they're gaining momentum right now. I thought it was impossible
        for anyone but the class of Ryuen to expel someone and take 100 class points. Has Horikita
        grown up… or… Perhaps Ayanokoji is working from the Shadows?"
    </p>
    <p>He emphasizes Ayanokoji's name and directs it to Sakayanagi. As if to confirm something.
    </p>
    <p>Sakayanagi continues in an uncaring manner.
    </p>
    <p>"He's really stepped up his game lately, What's going on?"
    </p>
    <p>"I don't think he's hiding anything more than his OAA. Well, Ayanokoji is not the only student like
        that."
    </p>
    <p>Hashimoto quickly backed down, as it was not a good idea to provoke and get attention.
    </p>
    <p>"But what are you going to do? We'll lose without you, but you're going to be absent, right?"

    </p>
    <h3>Part 3</h3>
    <p>
        Sato, who had run out of the electronics store a step ahead of the others, catches her breath in
        front of the women's restroom.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, why did I run away?"
    </p>
    <p>My dear friend went out with someone I love. There is nothing wrong with that.
    </p>
    <p>Even Knowing this, she was struck by an unspeakable urge when she saw them with their arms
        crossed.
    </p>
    <p>I don't know how I would have behaved if I had stayed in there.
    </p>
    <p>She thought so and abruptly ran away, but now she feel a strong sense of guilt about it.
    </p>
    <p>She sat down on the spot and hugged her knees.
    </p>
    <p>"I must try not to panic next time…"
    </p>
    <p>Because of this, Kei must be holding herself in the classroom with Ayanokoji-kun. In fact, she
        would have liked to be closer to Ayanokoji-kun more and more.
    </p>
    <p>As she stood up with this thought, a shadow fell on Sato.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="./assets/Year 2 Volume 6/images/image8.webp" alt="">


    <p>
        "Excuse me for interrupting. You are Maya Sato senpai, right?"
    </p>
    <p>Sato was approached by an unfamiliar student and was confused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>"That's right, but... well, who are you? A First grader, right?"
    </p>
    <p>" 'Who am I?' I don't think it's a big deal right now. Actually, I have something I need to
        tell Sato-senpai as soon as possible. If possible, could you give me a moment of your
        time?"
    </p>
    <p>"What? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>She is confused when a junior she does not know tells her that there is something important to
        be discussed.
    </p>
    <p>The image of Ayanokoji and Karuizawa walking closely with each other was still in her mind, and
        she still hasn't calmed down.
    </p>
    <p>"It's information about Ayanokoji-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>However, Sato's movement stopped after those words.
    </p>
    <p>"...Ayanokoji-kun?"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. He and his girlfriend, Kei Karuizawa-senpai."
    </p>
    <p>Sato turned her gaze involuntarily because she heard the names of the two people who have
        been occupying 99% of her mind for quite some time.
    </p>
    <p>Sato tensed up a bit, as the distance between her and the first grader decreased.
    </p>
    <p>"Can we talk somewhere private afterwards?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's…"
    </p>
    <p>The first-year student takes advantage of Sato's low physical abilities to get close enough to
        touch their lips to Sato's ear.
    </p>
    <p>"If Karuizawa-senpai were to withdraw from school, don't you think that would give Sato-senpai
        a chance?"
    </p>
    <p>Karuizawa, who is now my closest friend, and Ayanokoji, whom I have feelings for. The first
        grader says it's a chance to change the relationship between the two and her position.
    </p>
    <p>Several emotions begin to flow.
    </p>
    <p>"What are you talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>"I leave it to your judgment whether or not to listen to what I have to say. But if you don't listen,
    </p>
    <p>you will regret it for a long time to come. If you don't want to be noticed, you can come to my
        dorm room."
    </p>
    <p>Satisfied after verbally giving the room number, the first-year student turned away and left Sato.
    </p>
    <p>Sato, who was left there, was left confused, unable to take in the situation. But only one thing
        stuck in her memory.
    </p>
    <p>"I will have a chance"
    </p>
    <p>Words that suggested the possibility of dating Ayanokoji.
    </p>
    <p>Her chest tightens, and at the same time, feelings she doesn't want starts creeping up from the
        bottom of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>"I —"
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 4</h3>
    <p>
        While certain challenges remained, the class worked diligently to prepare for the sports festival.
    </p>
    <p>Some students objected to the idea of a cooperation with Ryuen, but when everything was
        disclosed and practice began, there were no major disputes, and practice for the team
        competition proceeded smoothly. Even classmates who were negative at first began to
        cooperate with each other in order to win, as they practiced and trained day and night.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, it's the night before the Sports festival.
    </p>
    <p>Around 9:30 at night, I made a call to Horikita.
    </p>
    <p>"It's very late. I was about to go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>I could hear the sound of a hair dryer in the background.
    </p>
    <p>"I have something important to tell you, something to do with the sports festival."
    </p>
    <p>"Something Important from you? I suppose I should take this a little more seriously."
    </p>
    <p>As soon as she said that, she turned off the hair dryer and everything went quiet.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, I was going to say something first as well. Sakayanagi-san is still intending to participate in
        tomorrow's sports festival, right? Didn't you say you could stop her?"
    </p>
    <p>"It's also related to that. I'm going to be absent from tomorrow's sports festival."
    </p>
    <p>"... Absent? Wait a minute, what do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>I could tell she was taken aback by my unexpected statement on the other end of the line. I
        heard a loud clang and a slight scream.
    </p>
    <p>"Are you okay?"
    </p>
    <p>"Sorry, I dropped the hairdryer ..."
    </p>
    <p>I heard the sound of a cell phone being put somewhere. It sounds like she is in a hurry to pick
        up the hairdryer.
    </p>
    <p>"So, what's the absence for? It's not like you're sick, right?"
    </p>
    <p>It is understandable to be confused by the seemingly healthy voice.
    </p>
    <p>"I have no problems with my health. In fact, I feel better than usual."
    </p>
    <p>"Then why? If you’re absent, you lose the 10 points you have. Even if we don’t count your wins,
    </p>
    <p>losing these 10 points is not good."
    </p>
    <p>Since the class only had 38 students, I can understand her temptation to complain.
    </p>
    <p>"I wouldn't say 10 points are low and easy to get. But this is the strategy I need."
    </p>
    <p>"...Your strategy?"
    </p>
    <p>Of course, not every time is there this sort of event where one's father's thugs will be mixed in
        as guests of honor.
    </p>
    <p>I'm going to say something here that I have been silent about until now.
    </p>
    <p>"It will lead to a way to hold Sakayanagi, which is inevitable when aiming to take down class
        A."
    </p>
    <p>"A way to hold off Sakayanagi-san ...?"
    </p>
    <p>"I told you. I have a way to keep Sakayanagi out of the sports festival."
    </p>
    <p>"I don't know why your absence would lead to Sakayanagi-san's absence, but …"
    </p>
    <p>Horikita was about to ask why, but she quickly reconsidered.
    </p>
    <p>"There is no way I can understand what you are thinking right now. Besides, even if I try to
        persuade you, you won't change your mind about taking a day off from the sports festival,
    </p>
    <p>right?"
    </p>
    <p>"Oh. I'll call the school first thing tomorrow morning to let them know I'm not feeling well."
    </p>
    <p>"Then I guess I have no choice but to trust you here."
    </p>
    <p>Despite her displeasure, Horikita agreed and gave her approval.
    </p>
    <p>"I was planning to get at least 3 first place as my personal goal, but now I have to add 10 more
        points."
    </p>
    <p>"Please Take care of it."
    </p>
    <p>After finishing the call, I plugged my cell phone to the charging cord.
    </p>
    <p>Horikita, who was just before going to bed, won't be able to sleep for a while because of her
        mind doing the recalculation of points.
    </p>
    <p>It was a little harsh, but I'll excuse it as a necessary cost.
    </p>
    <p>And there is one more person to call.
    </p>
    <p>All I have to do now is provide them with the required information, and I'll be good to go.
    </p>
    <p></p>
