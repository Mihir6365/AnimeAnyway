    <p class="c7"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Dreams. People dream almost every day, and whether or not they remember them is
            related to the depth of their sleep.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Considering the fact that this dream is etched in my brain in a very vivid way, it
            seems that I have been sleeping quite poorly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The dream I&#39;m seeing right now is, yes, a long time ago, when I was still a
            teenager.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was remembering in my dream how I felt when I saved up the money to buy one of
            those used light cars.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The car had over 100,000 kilometers on the odometer, and the interior was a shabby
            piece of junk that could not be fixed in any way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t say it was a comfortable ride, but I still drove it around feeling like
            a pillar of the family.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had no friends or lovers, and the time I spent with just myself and the car was
            irreplaceable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A long time has passed since then, and I am now asleep in the back seat without
            driving myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The deep, soft comfort of the genuine leather seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The warm feeling covering my back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All of these things have changed to something far more luxurious than the car I used
            to drive.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But why? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why is it that I can&#39;t quite reach the excitement and joy of those days?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-san, we will be arriving soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I quietly opened my eyes to hear such a voice from the driver&#39;s seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The scenery had changed from the city to a rough road surrounded by mountains.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s going to be a little bumpy from here on out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Three years have already passed since I was put in charge of the human resource
            development project by Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At first, I wondered what would happen, but the project, officially named the White
            Room Project, was launched in secret.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The number of people from the business world who wanted to invest in the project
            increased day by day, and the project succeeded in creating a surplus of funds. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, all the money raised is designated as being for the White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An important talk of investment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even going back to the past, I can&#39;t think of any subject that has gathered so
            much anticipation without even showing results yet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Like certain stocks, by the time that ordinary people learn they can make money,
            it&#39;ll already be too late.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only those who heavily invested while the project was still hidden will be able to
            make money.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even without mentioning Naoe-sensei&#39;s name, profits will be predicted when I
            start working.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All of this is on my side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The presence of the high education that the government has already succeeded with
            ahead of time will become quite important too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The government will eventually get involved in the white room, even if they don&#39;t
            talk about it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Those who have invested ahead of the curve can expect enormous publicity and
            payback.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if things have been going well up to this point, if when the lid opens the
            results are disappointing, the investors will not hesitate to return fire, and those who call us
            &ldquo;sensei, sensei&rdquo; will hurl abuse at us all at the same time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The important thing will be to achieve clear and constant results. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We cannot let our guard down at all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While I was on the move, I received a new call on my cell phone from someone in the
            business world who wanted to invest in the project.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Although the true value of the children of the first term had not yet been publicly
            announced, as soon as the second one began their intake period, applicants began to arrive one after
            another.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This was despite the fact that we had not yet ostensibly told them about the
            education and growth of the first term.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, this is my strategic move. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fact that the education in the white room was going well, that it was more
            successful than we had imagined, and that there were so many applicants that we might not be able to accept
            all of them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">By secretly disseminating such information about the White Room, I was increasing the
            value of its existence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In addition, there were people who wanted to use the White Room for purposes other
            than what it was intended for. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Which was, the existence of illegitimate children, an issue inseparable from wealthy
            families.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The mistress insists on giving birth to a child, and as a condition for that, she is
            allowed to leave her child with the White Room. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In this way, it is possible to completely eliminate the child&rsquo;s existence in
            public eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The achievement of giving birth to a child and the connection with her partner can
            still remain.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, this may be difficult for most people to understand, and
            irredeemable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We have no reason to hold back, since it will lead to the securing of human and
            financial resources for the White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I accepted the offer and immediately added it to my list.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They never learn, do they?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Do people go crazy because they have money? They easily repeat unwanted pregnancies
            because of their selfish acts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t mind utilizing them for secret births, but the looseness of their nether
            regions is appalling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now more than 30% of the entire second trimester has accepted illegitimate or other
            children that cannot be revealed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, the white room is still worth about that much.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We don&#39;t have enough credibility and track record to have beloved children
            entrusted to us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The financiers offer money and children, but there is still much they don&#39;t know
            about the real plan, and of course many of the staff members don&#39;t know the true meaning of the
            experiment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They will not doubt that the purpose of the experiment is to provide an education for
            children born under an unfortunate star, to raise them well, and to return them to society.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unreasonable, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I, myself, am still far more inclined to see children as experimental
            subjects.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To take care of the precious children of wealthy families now is to take a big
            risk.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">How to bridge this discrepancy is also an issue that cannot be avoided in the
            future</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Regardless, any child will be thoroughly educated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">White Room will eventually turn into a government-approved facility, and not just a
            pipe dream.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Eventually, educational facilities around the world will model themselves after the
            White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Naoe-sensei and I will take the lead in building that bridge, and we will have a
            greater voice within the party. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When the aging Naoe-sensei retires, I will have a huge boost waiting for me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Little by little, I am steadily moving forward one step at a time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m starting to really feel it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was not a mistake that I started working on the human resource development project
            with all my might from the day Naoe-sensei entrusted it to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This project is an essential part of my life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no doubt that bright hope lies far ahead.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However - I am not completely free of any uncertainties.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While I was working on the White Room Project, I&rsquo;ve been inevitably becoming
            more and more distant from the political world. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They have a very keen sense of smell.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Some of them must have figured out that I was working on a project like this behind
            the scenes. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am the right hand of Naoe-sensei who has a lot of allies but also a lot of enemies,
            so there are many people trying to pull out my weaknesses.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had to get some distance in order to differentiate the ones who are on my side, and
            the ones who are against me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">White Room is now half my body.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But that&#39;s why I made sure that my connections to the financial world were
            strong.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you can&#39;t expand your connections in the political world, you should
            strengthen your position in the business world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is a meaningful conduct precisely because the political and the financial worlds
            are connected as one in front and back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My ties to the financial world are becoming stronger day by day, so I have chosen to
            wear the mask of both a politician and a wealthy man.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I channel money from right to left, left to right, and strengthen myself with the
            money I collected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I heard that Sakayanagi-san arrived at the White Room just now.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. I don&#39;t mind the shaking, just hurry up a little.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.4i7ojhp"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even though I still had some time before my appointment, he was a guest, and it was
            not a good idea to keep him waiting.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After passing through the gate and letting the car pull up to the front entrance, I
            strode to the guest room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi, who had not sat down on the sofa but was standing and staring out the
            window, looked back at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, Ayanokoji-sensei. You arrived earlier than planned,
            so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Bowing politely, Sakayanagi approached me, smiling as usual.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was looking forward to today&#39;s unveiling of the White Room&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It looks like it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Over the past three years or so, I have continued to interact with Sakayanagi
            frequently. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had thought that I would not get along with Sakayanagi, who was born into a
            privileged environment, but even so, you never know what people will do when they have some common goal in
            mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fact that I had been dealing with people who were always trying to find out what
            was in each other&#39;s minds made it less painful for me to meet with Sakayanagi, who had no secretive
            side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Still, I was surprised at the security that didn&#39;t suit this kind of
            place.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have no choice. Right now, we can&rsquo;t make this place public. There are
            a lot of people out there desperately trying to find a scandal about me or Naoe-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps troubled by this response, Sakayanagi only smiled bitterly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You helped me first with the White Room Project, so I wanted to show it to you
            first.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I just want to support a plan that will increase the number of children that
            will be saved.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi in front of me, without any doubts, thinks that the children will lead
            Japan.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is only a card to let us move up in the world for me and Naoe-sensei, but
            that&rsquo;s already been factored in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whatever the aim, if there are children who will be saved, this man will accept
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is a good man beyond help, but that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no telling when
            he&rsquo;ll become an enemy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he notices the reality that the children&rsquo;s future is not being guaranteed,
            I&rsquo;m sure this man will distance himself from me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let me show you around.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Taking Sakayanagi with me, we headed for the first laboratory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Today is a big day for setting new policies for the White Room, and I
            definitely want you to see how the children have grown up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The children you&#39;ve taken in, they&#39;re already over three years old
            now, yes? That was very quick.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi, my collaborator, had also seen how many children there were.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure there are many scenes he can recall.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Will you not have children?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I met Sakayanagi, he had already been married for several years. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I still haven&#39;t heard anything about her being pregnant or giving birth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to, it&#39;s just that I haven&#39;t had
            the chance. We have talked about letting nature take its course.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, if either the husband, wife, or both of them have a problem, they
            won&rsquo;t mention it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If they have mutually agreed, it&rsquo;s not a bad choice either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. I said something unnecessary, please forget about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wondered if you were going to get married too,
            Ayanokoji-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If I had a partner, I would consider it, but unfortunately, I have been single
            for some time now, and I have no plans to get married.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A partner is indispensable for a politician to continue working for a long
            time. I hope you will find a partner soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Love, marriage, childbirth. I don&#39;t have time for that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They say that having someone to protect you makes you stronger, but unfortunately I
            don&#39;t think so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To have someone to protect you is to be weak at the same time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because I&#39;ve seen many politicians die for their protectors in the past.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.2xcytpi"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">2</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I arrived at the laboratory, I was met with a bit of a hustle and bustle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A comprehensive test of the children raised by Suzukake and the other three
            researchers was to take place.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry you had to wait. Please start immediately.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tabuchi, the only one in the room on a level playing field, moderated the session
            without any personal feelings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We divided them all into three groups, and worked for three years on educating
            them as thoroughly as possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We will decide who will represent us by seeing which one of these three
            teachers shows the most results.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Being given a brief explanation, Sakayanagi could see the situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m sure you already have a prediction of the outcome,
            Ayanokoji-sensei?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No. For the past three years, I&rsquo;ve mostly not touched anything.
            &nbsp;I&#39;ve been providing only the necessary support without any layman&#39;s interference. I
            don&rsquo;t even know who is going to show the best results.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For the past three years, I&rsquo;ve let everything move without even looking at the
            progress.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I answered honestly, Sakayanagi applauded in surprise, as if amused.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It must have taken a lot of courage to leave everything completely to the
            field, right? &nbsp;Most managers cannot trust their subordinates to do their work, and they tend to talk
            over them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because the ones who spend money usually hold needless, wicked thoughts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;After all, I&#39;m working with other people&#39;s money. If it had been money
            made from my blood and sweat, I might have been more critical. The only ones who will suffer if the money
            goes down the drain are the investors.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&#39;s why I was able to stand firm and wait three years.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, still. If you fail, there is a high possibility of you losing everything,
            Ayanokoji-sensei. It&rsquo;s the same for ordinary businessmen. They receive large loans from the bank and
            fight a battle for the company&rsquo;s fortune. It is the bank&rsquo;s money, but you can also say that it
            is the company president&rsquo;s personal money.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the sense of assuming responsibility, it may be no different from being a
            manager.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You have never changed your habit of immediately lifting up other
            people.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s my nature. There is always good in others, and it&#39;s my job to
            recognize it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He answered without hesitation that what I said was a true compliment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is what I like about this man, and what I don&#39;t like about him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Children are coming into the room through the glass that is also a
            one-way-mirror.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children, who were clearly labelled with the name plates of each researcher, took
            their seats in an orderly fashion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If they are 3 years old, they are just about ready for a little conversation,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is understandable that Sakayanagi, who does not have any children of his own, does
            not intuitively understand this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The children are beginning to show signs of understanding, intelligence, and
            self-esteem, as well as a bit of manual dexterity. The most obvious development at first sight may be motor
            development. Standing on one leg, walking on tiptoe, and climbing stairs smoothly. That&#39;s just a
            generalization, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s impressive enough that they can do that,
            but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With a tense look on his face, Sakayanagi looked at the children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Begin!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Under the instruction, the children turned over the paper at once and picked up their
            pens.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A&hellip; test?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No one got out of their seats, and they were more focused on the questions with a
            power of concentration stronger than those of primary school kids running around the neighbourhood.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the contents of the test they&rsquo;re challenging?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s an arithmetic problem. Here it is.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I received the paper that Tabuchi had brought, and together with Sakayanagi, I looked
            it over for the first time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The problems range from addition and subtraction to multiplication and
            division.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;These are questions that are meant for primary school kids, right?
            Amazing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi was impressed, but Tabuchi calmly replied:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The world is a big place. There are gifted children who can solve more
            difficult problems. They are undoubtedly genetic prodigies.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, the children here are a bit different than the gifted ones, aren&rsquo;t
            they..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, they are. They are not special. They&#39;re just children who don&#39;t
            show any ability bias. They&#39;ve all developed the ability to face problems.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The way the children were struggling with difficult problems was no different from
            that of the students taking the exam.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The first discomfort I felt when looking at the three groups was that Ishida&#39;s
            and Souya&#39;s groups were so similar in their attitudes and reactions to the test that I could not tell
            the difference even if I mixed them up, whereas Suzukake&#39;s group did not move an inch.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The real-time camera tracking reveals that some of the children&#39;s answers are
            wrong, but they never seem rushed, upset, or distraught.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Regardless of whether this is a good or bad thing, Ishida and the others are clearly
            upset.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What kind of education can create such inorganic children..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya&#39;s mutterings were those of a researcher.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My first task is to make sure they have a mature mindset, so that when they
            can&#39;t solve a problem, they can do so calmly, objectively, and without panic. I have mercilessly
            punished children who fail to do so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Far from being the reaction of a child, they were like robots without
            feelings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Corporal punishment? For 3 year old children?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, from when they were newborns. And I don&#39;t want you to call it corporal
            punishment, Souya. This is my education.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It would be a big problem if not accompanied by results, but the overall percentage
            of correct answers was clearly higher than that of both Ishida and Souya and their children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The concentration of those children is close to that of adults. They are so
            absorbed in their work that even if I called out to them nearby, they might not notice me right
            away.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After saying this and having grasped the academic ability of almost everyone,
            Suzukake played music in the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the loud sound, which was also out of place, the children in the room stopped
            their hands and began to look around.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the children Suzukake was educating were not responding to the sound, just
            as the man boasted, but were instead focusing on solving problems.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How is something like this possible?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida, too, was surprised by Suzukake&#39;s education.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Education. Children are terrified of being punished in a variety of ways. They
            will do whatever they deem effective against this, whether it be physical pain or mental anguish. If you
            push them to the edge of their fears, the fears will eventually go away. Not in the metaphorical sense, but
            in the real sense. We&#39;re still in the process of doing that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...With all due respect, that is unquestionably corporal punishment. There is
            no meaning to the abilities gained by doing this. I don&#39;t think your educational policy is the right
            one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It would certainly be flattering to say that there are no problems at all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi has reason to be angry.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have no right to interfere, but I can&rsquo;t agree with
            Suzukake-san&rsquo;s way of doing things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, Sakayanagi, but I&#39;m not looking for an outsider&#39;s opinion.
            Don&#39;t bud in.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, Ishida-san and Souya-san&#39;s education also shows suitable
            results.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida and Souya&#39;s groups seem to be growing more naturally as human
            beings.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, will they grow up to be geniuses in the true sense of the word?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if they grow up and become excellent human beings to some extent, it is doubtful
            whether they will be able to compete with the naturally occurring gifted and geniuses in certain
            fields.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the other hand, Suzukake&#39;s education seems to have both big risks and big
            returns. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I only care about results. I don&#39;t care about the process.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why. That&rsquo;s the reason I chose to work under you;
            because I knew that you would let me be free. I knew that you would only care about the
            results.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Unlike Sakayanagi showing his disgust, Ishida and Souya are acting as
            expected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I won&rsquo;t say he has zero feelings towards the children, but he seems more
            focused on being a researcher.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The adults are gazing at the children Suzukake has created with a twinkle in their
            eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After the tests on the academic side, the next step is to check their development in
            terms of physical exercise.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The three groups have very different educational orientations, so unlike the
            study aspect, where we have standardized the testing methods, we tell each of them to express the abilities
            they have acquired in their own unique way.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children Ishida educated are dexterously using their small hands to perform
            crafts.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya&#39;s children are successfully using the iron bars and jungle gym to show
            their movement.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it is the children educated by Suzukake who are also astonishing in this
            physical aspect.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is not only their dexterity and physical agility. They are also able to perform on
            the piano and have acquired a variety of other skills.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is a 3 year old playing&hellip;? I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, it is obvious to anyone with ears that the children&#39;s skills are far
            from professional.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But even an adult could not play this well with just a little practice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the important thing is not whether they can play the piano or not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How much more have you ingrained into them in just three years,
            Suzukake-san..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My education is far above the average person&#39;s ability to learn. If you
            don&#39;t have the talent to learn in a short time, you will be punished endlessly. The brain naturally
            hates it and forces you to mature quickly. People who are small, but have the same things we have, have
            unlimited potential.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the difference by three years. Then, when it comes to 5 years, 10 years, 15
            years, 20 years&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wonder how much of a lead we will have? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I myself get goosebumps when I see this result.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The group trained by Suzukake was by far the best in the overall results.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida and Souya forgot to hide their frustration and looked at Suzukake&#39;s
            data.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You did well. You have shown me your talent.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you. But, I don&rsquo;t think there is a large difference of talent
            between me and these two. I&#39;m rather impressed with how well they&#39;ve done in their formal
            education.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So even you praise others, huh, Suzukake?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The truth is the truth. Besides, as you can see, my children inevitably lack
            something.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Emotion, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. Ishida-san and Souya-san were nurturing the children with human feelings.
            That is normal. However, I have thoroughly eliminated them. I thought that by not allowing the ability to
            communicate through dialogue to flourish, I could raise the level of human potential.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The competition is only in terms of the brain and the body.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, for Suzukake, victory was already in sight from the beginning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you choose me as leader, you risk creating an impersonality that, to say it
            clearly, cannot be compared to the first-term students. But I believe we can create the strongest human
            being.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After three years of putting this research into practice, Suzukake was clearly
            convinced on this point.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ishida, and Souya. What do you two think about emotions?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is no denying that the inhumanity factor will be heightened. But... I
            also believe that this is what the White Room should be. As one of the researchers, I would like to see the
            strongest human being cultivated by Suzukake-shi.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">[TL Note 7 : &ldquo;-shi&rdquo; is an honorific like &ldquo;-san&rdquo;. While this
            Japanese honorific isn&rsquo;t widely used in speech, The suffix -shi is used when politely referring to
            strangers, and is fairly formal.]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya, agreeing, also nodded.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very well. With Suzukake as the leader, we will now start to create the
            curriculum for the second term students. You will be in charge of what kind of training policy we will
            adopt.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Suzukake bowed deeply, and looked to shake hands with Ishida and the others.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi turned around, and was about to leave the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know you don&#39;t like it. However, this is also a form of
            education.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without looking back, Sakayanagi left the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t care if a considerable number of children will probably be sacrificed for
            the research. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If we can finally create the perfect human being, I would say it is a small
            sacrifice. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The goal is to train 100 people and make 100 of them perfect.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, that is the ultimate final goal of White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For now, the first step is to find out how far human beings can be trained.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In that sense, it is encouraging to have someone like Suzukake who is capable of
            fearless research.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, with the support of people like Ishida and others who have some common
            sense, it is also possible to prevent reckless behaviour.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that we are already past the stage of grumbling about trivialities.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now, it is my job to do my best to suppress this and to stop it from becoming public
            knowledge.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I must continue to provide &nbsp;a place to research without hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.1ci93xb"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">3</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After about an hour or so, I faced Sakayanagi.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">How did an outsider unrelated to White Room feel after seeing today&rsquo;s
            results?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Needless to say, this is my best opportunity to find out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let me ask for your opinion again. Of course, there is no need to hide
            anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot today while watching how the
            children have grown.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">White Room&rsquo;s reason for being, and its usefulness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wonder if Sakayanagi was able to feel this first hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The children I saw today were far from the ordinary 3 year olds I know.
            Needless to say, the children educated by &nbsp;Suzukake-san, and even those by Ishida-san and Souya-san,
            are probably better than 90% of the children in this world.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi&rsquo;s signature of starting his search with praise remains
            unchanged.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that even for a gifted student from a wealthy family, it
            wouldn&#39;t be easy to bring them to this level.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, are you saying that they can&rsquo;t compete with the remaining
            10%?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you experience that yourself, Ayanokoji-sensei?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We have been able to demonstrate that children who have grown up to the age of three
            have more developed intelligence and physical abilities than the average child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are certain results coming out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the financial world was still skeptical, and I felt that we would not be
            able to dispel this skepticism.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you ask me if they are as good or better than the gifted geniuses at age 3, it
            would be a gray area.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if I wait for the first term&rsquo;s children to grow up to four or five years
            like this, it would still not be conclusive.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, I thought that it was good enough.. If we can give these children, who
            may not get the education they want, this thorough education, we can give them the skills they need to be
            successful after stepping into society.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A general review from Sakayanagi, who does not know White Room&rsquo;s true
            shape.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s why I had some misgivings about Suzukake-san as the leader of the
            group. For children... No, for human beings, emotions are essential. It is not possible to be happy, angry,
            sad, or happy without any of them. If you can rectify this thought, I will not hesitate to continue my
            support and assistance.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. I knew you would say that. But do you really think that will convince
            your current investors and those in the business world whom you have yet to meet? Not everyone thinks only
            of the children like you do. There are big interests involved in this White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you think even more rigorous education is necessary?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Anyone with a certain amount of money can produce
            brilliant students. We can have lecturers who graduated from top universities and coaches who have produced
            Olympic athletes. If you continue to educate the gifted from an early age, you can usually improve their
            skills to a certain degree. There is no point in having a White Room that produces nothing more than the
            same level of results. It&#39;s worthless.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Who would invest tens or hundreds of millions into the White Room then?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is needed is outstanding ability. The ability to go beyond Japan&#39;s
            top universities to become the best in the world, and the physical ability to surpass that of Olympic
            athletes. We need people who have the mental fortitude to compete with the best from around the world. That
            is the kind of power we need in the White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t that a bit excessive? Not all children who have no parents or who
            have been abandoned by their parents are looking for that kind of power. It is enough to give them the
            ability to fit in and survive.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo; I understand what you are trying to say. It&#39;s a good enough opinion for
            consulting.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Ayanokoji-sensei. The story you&rsquo;ve told me is really true,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. I am working to save underprivileged children. You know that I have
            my own ambition, but nothing more and nothing less.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi, who had been looking at me with suspicious eyes, bowed his head lightly
            as if he was apologizing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If that is the case, I have nothing more to say to you. Certainly, please give
            the children a caring and thoughtful education. If you do so, the day will come when the people will
            recognize the White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After saying so, Sakayanagi left the office. He did look unconvinced, though.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re naive, Sakayanagi. That&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This world is not so naive as to accept such mere idealistic thoughts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What I am looking for is not a reasonable result, but the best result.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it&rsquo;s still not enough.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I want another push, and another push after that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no guarantee that the current results will be enough to keep the investors
            nodding their heads forever.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A factor that will strongly push their backs&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I want a decisive blow.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, imposing a more rigorous education on the children now will not produce
            immediate results.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It will take three years... no, five years, or at least that long.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is necessary, to create a persuasive force.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What should I do..?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In a short period of time, how can I get the financial world to move in the direction
            of more money?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Think, I have to think&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This White Room may change the world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I want these words of mine to have weight.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Weight, huh..?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Here, I am reminded of the words Naoe-sensei said to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no real success, without cutting oneself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how passionately I talk about the success or failure of education, my words
            will never carry any real weight.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The financial world doesn&#39;t trust the White Room either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why is that?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s only natural. No matter how far I go, it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s
            education.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It doesn&rsquo;t hurt me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With this, it&rsquo;s just some extended play.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is necessary to show proof that one can safely leave their own valuable child in
            White Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For that, there is one thing I can do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Hello?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s late now, but the owner of the phone who was probably still sleeping
            answered with a sleepy voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mika. I have a favour to ask of you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.3whwml4"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">4</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A red colour is illuminated at the end of the darkness, followed immediately by
            rising smoke.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I saw a silhouette emerge in my vision in the dim light, and raised my upper
            body.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry. Did I wake you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Never mind, it&#39;s time to get back.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The plan was to close things out at 11 p.m., but the date had changed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Politicians are so busy, huh? Working until this kind of hour.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s easier to move around at night than in the daytime.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika&#39;s brand of cigarettes changes every time we meet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is because every time Mika changes the man she sleeps with, it is an old trick
            of hers to show that she is tainted by him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How long are you going to keep doing this kind of work?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right, I can&#39;t keep doing this forever. I have aged a lot since I met you,
            Atsuomi.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Freshness is life for a woman.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Year by year, as time goes by, this freshness decays.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The world tends not to acknowledge this, and in fact, hates to put it into words, but
            only those who understand it will succeed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If they understand this, they will gain a weapon other than their youth.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My advice to you. It&rsquo;s time to wash your hands of this
            business.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hearing that from you&hellip; It&rsquo;s a bit surprising.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After smiling in a funny way, Mika got up from the bed, still stark naked.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I too thought it was time to move on. But I don&#39;t have a vision for
            the future. I don&#39;t have a vision of marrying someone and having a happy family. It&#39;s not like
            I&#39;m going to have children, make friends, send them to primary school, and all that&hellip; heh, I laugh
            at myself when I think of that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll do fine.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not often that people of the same sex like me. I
            might have a harder time than you think. But... I think I&#39;ll step out for a bit. You&#39;ve made me a
            lot of money and allowed me to dream.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika&#39;s assets would be enough to just live decently.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, this woman got her money at a young age.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She must be more than a little afraid to lower that standard of living.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I need you to do one last big job for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I took out the marriage certificate I had prepared and put it on the table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? What is this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want you to marry me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not joking.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Atsuomi&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As Mika approached, her eyes moistened slightly... and she gave a small laugh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you want? You&#39;re not the kind of man who would choose me, are
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&#39;t I look like a man who wants a pure marriage with the woman he
            loves?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&#39;re right. It&#39;s a very different kind of marriage than the one you
            want, and it&#39;s only a formality when you roll it up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have a future I need to achieve.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For that, it is essential to have someone like this woman who has future
            troubles.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have a new piece of the puzzle that I need in order to proceed with my plan.
            I need your help for that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Explain it to me in a way I can understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a child. A child of my flesh and blood. It will be an important
            pawn in my rise to power.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika was taken aback, but eventually understood what I was saying.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So&hellip; You want me to have a child?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Of course, I will pay you as much money as it takes to
            convince you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait a bit. Why me? There must be a mountain of women willing to happily give
            birth if you pay them money.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If it were only about money. However, you are convenient for me in many ways.
            You have some influence in the financial world, and you&rsquo;re a good liar. The important thing is to
            deceive the people around us. There&rsquo;s no meaning if I have a child from a woman I don&rsquo;t
            know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to play the good wife, huh..? Until when, though? Do
            you want to make me pretend to be your wife for years and years?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry. We will announce the pregnancy and hold the ceremony when the
            time is right. As soon as we have the baby, I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She understands, but she still can&rsquo;t perfectly grasp the situation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is another reason why I chose you. Your origins are obviously inferior
            to the general social values. Your mother is an uneducated woman who works in the night business. Your
            sister is the same, divorced and living a life of no worth whatsoever.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&rsquo;t it..? It is true,
            though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If a superior mother gives birth to a superior child, that means it was already a
            diamond from the start.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is my job to polish a nondescript stone on the side of the road so that it
            shines like a gemstone. Refine it so that a mere stone becomes more than a diamond.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As I said before, it is absolutely essential to deceive people. It&#39;s easy
            to get an incompetent woman to be a surrogate, but it&#39;s hard to hide the whiff of artifice. One
            can&#39;t fool the financial world, which has a keen sense of smell.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I want my precious child to appear on stage, I need to go through the proper
            channels.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With Mika, more than a few people know about our connection, and they will accept it
            as a natural progression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can choose the method you want, whether it&#39;s artificial insemination
            or in vitro fertilization, regardless of timing or method. Ideally, you should be able to have a baby within
            a year to a year and a half.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I will entrust my own child with White Room, and further signify its
            existence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now this is truly a well-thought-out plan.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
