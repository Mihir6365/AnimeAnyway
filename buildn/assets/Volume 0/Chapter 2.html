    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even with the voice of authority from a big-name politician, things won&rsquo;t move
            smoothly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The Human Resource Development Plan is still in the planning stage, with everything
            including the funding starting from this point forwards; it&rsquo;s a start from a blank page, so to
            speak.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Other than the unchangeable framework that is &ldquo;nurturing from infancy&rdquo;,
            many things will be changed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We need to be flexible and adapt to changes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...It looks like it&rsquo;ll be a troublesome project.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I put both feet on the table full of messy documents, and continued staring at
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If we make one mistake in the cut, let alone earning praise, this project will earn
            scorn.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A facility not to take advantage of children, but to help them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We must give the people that impression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11 c15">However, these are subjects that should be handled after the project actually
            starts.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Currently, taking this starting stage, we are to collect children to be test
            subjects, and a great budget.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, some means to protect the children is also necessary.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I manually entered the 11-number digit from my memory and made a call.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. Please give the phone to Ooba, I have a new job to ask of
            him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">First, I have to think of a way to approach the pawn that I can use who won&rsquo;t
            worry about right or wrong.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After Ooba picked up the phone, I conveyed that I was looking for a way to acquire
            newborn infants, and asked what I should do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, at the point I contacted Ooba, I suppose that it will be inevitable that
            evil methods will be used.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">During the phone call, a buzzer-like sound was ringing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;ll contact you again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I cut the conversation with Ooba, and responded to my visitor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Good morning. It&rsquo;s Kamogawa. Is Ayanokoji-san there?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just come in. It&rsquo;s not locked.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excuse me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa showed his face at the corner of my run-down office of 10,000 Yen in rent,
            though it is close to the centre of town.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whoah.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As he opened the door, Kamogawa clearly showed his rude manners.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, without saying anything about it, I reacted to my visitor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-san, are you perhaps living in this office? That&rsquo;s what it
            seems like&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The beer cans rolling around under his feet, or the unwashed sheet over the rotten
            sofa. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Seeing the clothes randomly thrown around all over the place, even a child can easily
            imagine that I live here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean anything by it, but&hellip; Well, it is a bit unlike
            you, or&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not fitting for my years of service, is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The salary for a national parliament member is just over 1,000,000 Yen. Adding on the
            bonus and other things, it&rsquo;s over 20,000,000 Yen. Further, I am also granted various allowances under
            different names.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kisarazu-san who is three steps above me was boasting that he got a place at
            the top floor of a tower mansion at the centre of the city the week after he became a parliament member.
            Apparently, a loan examination that would normally be impassable is also a one-shot for him.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as if the loans are passed because he is a parliament
            member.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;From any point of view, the annual income of a parliament member is indeed
            quite high. However, whether you are in the House of Representatives or the House of Councillors, you are
            restricted to be elected one time every few years. A bank would not loan money based only on such an
            unstable job.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, Kisarazu-san said that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The loan amount, which bank it is, and your connections. There are many other
            conditions to arrange the passing of a loan.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see, that&rsquo;s how it works&hellip; I guess I can&rsquo;t pass for one,
            huh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s probably the other way around. It is true that the evaluation for Kamogawa
            in front of my eyes is lower than Kisarazu, but, the bank will see through to his father, Kamogawa
            Toshizou.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If they hear that he was looking for a loan, staff from various banks would come meet
            Kamogawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Bringing one or two boxes of cake with them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How boring.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Boring, is it? Wouldn&rsquo;t anyone long for living in a high class tower
            mansion?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kamogawa. I will say this for your sake, don&rsquo;t imitate someone like
            Kisarazu.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For a parliament member who&rsquo;s only in it for the money, it is no strange thing
            to spend your money in such a useless way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying you shouldn&rsquo;t buy any real estate. However, I am
            saying that you should not do so with the wrong timing. Money is limited, but its possibilities are
            limitless.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa did not understand, but he nodded, as if he did.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say that 100,000,000 million appears in your hands from today on.
            What would you do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">[ TL Note 4 : Doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Yen&rdquo;. ]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? 100,000,000? I will save around 90,000,000, and use up 10,000,000 as I
            want. I&rsquo;d go to hostess bars, buy a car and such. Maybe I&rsquo;d put some into stocks. I would buy a
            mansion too if I had around 200,000,000, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s a model answer, in a certain sense, but still a useless way of spending
            the money, just like Kisarazura.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You would use it in a different way, right, Ayanokoji-san? What would you
            do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Think about it yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh~? Please tell me~&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">100,000,000. If I had around that much money, I would probably use it all up in a few
            days.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Various bribes and investments to connect with the financial world, I would invest
            for my future in many ways.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c15">I have no time to spend money on an office or a house when even small change is
            too valuable to spend.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c35 c16 c11 c15"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All I need is the money I invest coming back to me many times over in many
            years.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If the title of the greatest power holder in this country, my final station, comes in
            such a way, then that&rsquo;s perfect.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, what are you here for?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being cruel? As Naoe-sensei said, I am here to help you,
            Ayanokoji-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No need.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t work. I am one of the people who heard about that project
            too. I don&rsquo;t have any complaints about you getting most of the merits, but even I-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa is a talentless man living a shitty life, but I can understand his feelings
            that he wants to be recognized. Because it is indeed rare that you can seldom acquire it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, at its core, being a parliament member is a job that you cannot take a
            vacation from. We are special servants for the nation with no set working times.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, we are currently in a parliamentary session. We must participate in strategy
            and research meetings for the Citizens Party. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most of my schedule is filled with support groups, visitor correspondence, government
            affairs, and public business. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Can you be of use?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will show you that I can. Even if I am rotten, I am Kamogawa
            Toshizou&rsquo;s son, you know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Your father doesn&rsquo;t have such a name in the world of politics that you can
            speak of him so greatly, though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I suppose I cannot so easily ignore a directive from Naoe-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then, you can be as useful as you want to be.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Since he had never been given a role in anything worthwhile before, Kamogawa&rsquo;s
            eyes lit up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What kind of work is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We have to secure an experimental facility for the project. You will be in
            charge of selecting the site. The size, the budget, and an ability to avoid publicity. If it all goes well,
            I will give you your next assignment. You want to be a great parliament member who can be recognized by
            Naoe-sensei, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I, I see. That is certainly something I have to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It may not be on the scale of a high school, but the number of children will
            be increased on a yearly basis. As such, it will naturally be required to have a suitable amount of space.
            It will also be important to maintain anonymity.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This project cannot be advertised openly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We can&rsquo;t afford to have the press write about some dangerous education of
            infants and toddlers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Looking at it from a budgetary standpoint, it is inevitably going to be a
            rural place, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa&rsquo;s face, which had been looking so stupid for a while, changed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is a man who has been in warm water for a while, but he is certainly not happy to
            be called a second-generation. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he is given the right work and the right words of praise, he might be useful, to
            some extent. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, he has to be.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand. I will give it my best.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask. This is the best you&rsquo;ve looked since I&rsquo;ve
            met you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is, is that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After praising him only a little, his silly face returned.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you going to do now, Ayanokoji-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In order to prepare the facilities, money is the most important thing.
            I&rsquo;m going to start making arrangements for that.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Applying the conditions I&rsquo;ve talked about, we will need a considerable amount
            of money just for the initial start-up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If we also take into account the necessity of securing human resources, we would need
            to prepare 500,000,000.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To buy safety, we will need more than 600,000,000, or 700,000,000, but&hellip;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You mean talking about this project and asking for funding,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, that is my goal.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they be happy to give their kids a special
            education?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This guy really can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s ahead of us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Who is going to fund a project that is only a few sheets of paper?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the first place, it isn&rsquo;t an amount of money that the wealthy will give over
            after just saying a few words.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, as a politician, I cannot accept donations on the surface; as such, it is
            necessary to go through a process of making donations to groups such as supporting associations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are upper limits and such on donations, but it is difficult to find a
            politician who adheres to them. There are many ways to circumvent donations and many loopholes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, even on a piece of paper like this, if Naoe-sensei simply says the words
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo;, large amounts of money will come out of nowhere.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without that, it is imperative that we find one big investor first.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c15">Even if I don&#39;t have the same unifying force that Naoe-sensei has, if that
            person is to invest in us, then I have to make him believe that I do.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c35 c16 c11 c15"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If that were to happen, I&rsquo;m sure it would not be impossible to raise an amount
            of money close to 500,000,000.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I halfway chased Kamogawa out of the office and sent him to work, I took out three
            bankbooks from my desk. Three bank accounts, including a regional bank.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In total&hellip; Just a little less than 10,000,000, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is an unreliable campaign fund, but I have no choice but to start out with
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c16 c14">1</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">An upscale residential area, located in Shirokane in Minato Ward.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the corner, a single large, soaring historical estate stands out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Probably being remodelled many times with a lot of money, the exterior did not feel
            old. It was not a place for a mere politician to be living in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c15">With numerous monitoring cameras before the entrance, it has a strict
            atmosphere.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c35 c16 c11 c15"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After glancing at the fine nameplate with Sakayanagi written on it and pressing the
            chime, the first one to come out was a middle-aged man who looked to be the servant of this estate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Since I had already made an appointment, I was allowed to pass through the gate
            without any trouble.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The spacious tatami mats with the scent of soft rush grass showed no signs of
            spoilage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Probably being re-papered in set periods, I could tell at my first look that there
            was a lot of money spent on this area.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I proceeded further into the building, a Western-style room came into view, and I
            was told to sit on a sofa and wait.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m thinking about how I should behave towards the person I am about to meet
            soon.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without hesitation, I chose to deeply sit on the sofa and wait.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As someone who works alongside Naoe-sensei and someone who has a project for the
            future, I have no intention of making myself look small.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I stared at the steam from the tea that was eventually brought to me, the person I
            was waiting for appeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you for waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My first impression at this time was that he was a thin, delicate man.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">His voice was quiet and he did not have the arrogant attitude that many rich people
            had.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pleased to meet you. My name is Ayanokoji. Thank you for taking the time out
            of your busy schedule.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While keeping a confident attitude, I still showed the minimum amount of
            courtesy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am Sakayanagi. I have heard many times about you from
            Naoe-sensei.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing bad, I hope.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course not. I was told that you were a very brilliant person. Further, when
            I heard that you are the same age as me, I felt a sense of embarrassment.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no way a man who has been walking on the winning path since birth would care
            about someone below him. If it is simple modesty, I shall praise him for being a good liar.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much. However, I hear that you are also quite famed,
            Sakayanagi-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">First, I will begin by confirming Sakayanagi&rsquo;s character and
            authenticity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, I still have a ways to go. It&rsquo;s just that my father was amazing.
            That is really all there is.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He did not go with my compliment, but smiled bitterly as if he was troubled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From then on, we continued to probe into each other with words in turns for a while,
            but my impression of him did not change. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He showed no signs of wanting to end the conversation, so I thought it would be best
            that I took the first step.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The reason I am here bothering you like this is that I remembered that
            Naoe-sensei has told me I should ask you for help if I am ever worried about something. I have humbly come
            here to do so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most of the time, the wealthy do not welcome a conversation starting in this
            way.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As for the reason, it&rsquo;s because money is at the root of most worries.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Wanting to invest but lacking capital, or wanting to start a business. It&rsquo;s all
            related to money.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What did you need of me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He doesn&rsquo;t look to be on guard, but his face changed slightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Currently, I am thinking of starting a project. However, I will need a large
            amount of money to proceed with this project.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c15">&quot;I see. So, what kind of trouble... No, what kind of request did you come to
            me for?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c35 c16 c11 c15"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am not telling you to put out money after meeting you for the first time,
            Sakayanagi-san. However, I am here to ask for something close to that. I want you to be a pipe between me
            and the financial world.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I took out a new document from a clear file that I had prepared on my own, and
            pointed towards it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without reaching for it, Sakayanagi continued looking over at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could not tell it from his expression, but he was wary, after all.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, he has to be.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even though he has heard of me by name, I am still a stranger to him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is not as if the titles of politicians are recognized by the public either.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If that were the case, he would not simply look over the documents.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he knew, he would realize that it would be troublesome to get involved.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. So, are you saying that you are not asking me to invest
            money?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Yes. I can&rsquo;t suddenly barge in and ask you to give me money. If you
            agree with the project, then that&rsquo;s fine, but the important thing is not to bow my head and ask for
            money, but to convince you and have many people give me money.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, if I don&rsquo;t even get a chance to present the project, it will end up
            being nothing more than an unimplemented empty theory.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;We want to launch this project to save the lives of as many children as
            possible, and ensure that they receive the correct education. I am hoping to provide such a facility. I am
            one of the people who were strongly impressed by the advanced nurturing high school that your father has
        </span><span class="c35 c11 c15">implemented</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Children, Education, Life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is certain that these words will connect with Sakayanagi.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man&rsquo;s father is in charge of high school education, and he is the very
            leader who guides children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He cannot allow himself to go through the wrong path of not even taking a look at
            this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t you also have the choice of seeking counsel from
            my father instead of me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That may indeed be the right course of action. However, the world of politics
            is not that simple. It is Kijima-sensei who informed the world of the advanced nurturing high school. I
            believe that your father has a deep connection with Kijima-sensei. In which case, how could I, a member of
            his rival&rsquo;s, Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s faction, seek his advice?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you not consider the possibility that I might have a close relationship
            with Kijima-sensei?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, there is a possibility. However, I&rsquo;ve never heard of such a
            thing. I thought that, in this case, I would take a chance.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are lies mixed into my words, but the truth is the majority. Even if this
            man&rsquo;s father is a sensible power-holder, if he is in the Kijima faction, I cannot tell him about our
            plans.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let me ask you frankly, you definitely want to avoid this information being
            leaked to Kijima-sensei. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will not deny that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, I find it a little hard to be convinced. Am I on
            Kijima-sensei&rsquo;s side, Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s side, or in the middle? This is not clear to you. Despite
            that, are you not worried about telling me about this? If I take a look at those documents, I will gather
            information. You can&rsquo;t know to whom I will tell about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is indeed true. Still, if I lied and told you that I trusted you after
            only talking for a few minutes&hellip; Things will just get cold.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sakayanagi nodded without hiding.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;However, as a politician myself, there are things that I also humbly hold
            faith in. Which is to say, I completely trust Naoe-sensei. Naoe-sensei knows the weight of words very well.
            If you were the kind of person who would leak our talk to Kijima-sensei or your father, then Naoe-sensei
            would never tell me to rely on you if I had a problem.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You trust Naoe-sensei, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Most politicians join a faction sooner or later. No matter what faction you
            are in, once you have decided to support someone, you just have to believe them until the end. I think there
            should not even be a shred of hesitation in that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. So Naoe-sensei keeps you close by his side.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As you know, Ayanokoji-sensei, my father is a close friend of Kijima-sensei.
            Did you ever think it strange that I would have a connection with Naoe-sensei?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, I can&rsquo;t say that I have never questioned it.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I respect my father, but, at the same time, I see him as my objective. I
            don&rsquo;t know if we will follow the same path or different ones, but I at least want to explore different
            possibilities. That is why I have been closely studying with Naoe-sensei, who is considered a worthy rival
            of my father. My father does not object to this, and, in fact, he quietly supports it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is quite broad-minded to broaden your horizons even if it is with an enemy.
            Further, at the same time, he seems to trust that you will definitely keep your mouth closed.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In a position like this man&rsquo;s, it is basically a case of following his
            father&rsquo;s footsteps.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you have a relationship with a hostile organisation, you have an opportunity to
            gain information about them, but there is also the risk of passing it onto them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I can see that Naoe-sensei likes him, and it is probably true that
            Sakayanagi has his trust.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, I have even more confidence. I would definitely like you to take
            a look.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Depending on your conditions, I was going to immediately ask you to take it
            back, but I suppose I cannot do so now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have certainly seen your spirit and conviction. I will take a look.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Finally, Sakayanagi picked up the documents and looked through them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After reading through them, he muttered to himself without thinking too
            deeply.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is true that several hundred children are abandoned in Japan every year. We
            are not accepting this reality, and it is no bad thing for a politician to try and do something about it. In
            fact, it should be welcomed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You mean you sympathise with me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course I do. However, this is exactly the sort of issue that should be on
            the government&rsquo;s agenda, and I don&rsquo;t mean to sound rude, but, as a private citizen&hellip;
            isn&rsquo;t this none of my business? I definitely hope that you will take this issue on and work on the
            countermeasures.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If I could do that, I would. However, the national system is not that simple.
            There are still children being abandoned. There are still children who cannot receive the education they
            want because of a fatherless, motherless, or a poor household. This cycle of poverty shows no signs of
            stopping, and the inequality in society is continuously widening. Am I wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you watch TV, I am sure you already know. Mothers in despair secretly
            giving birth in train stations. It is certainly not a rare story. I think it is very regrettable for a
            mother to end the life of her child because of the current lack of legal provisions, or because of the
            public&rsquo;s attention. Of course, there are those who can become ruthless towards unwanted births, but
            that doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone wants to become a criminal. If there is a generous place where people can
            be helped with open arms, the number of grieving people will be kept to a minimum.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If this project comes to fruition, it will save the lives of 10, 20, and one day,
            over 100 children. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, I am sure it will increase beyond that.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am sure that you, Sakayanagi-san, also understand that one cannot do
            anything they want just by becoming a politician. Whether you are a member of the parliament or a local
            council, your title says that you enact laws, decide budgets, and enact ordinances, but while those who hold
            the real power act for their own personal gain, no one listens to young politicians. Or&hellip; Do you
            expect me to continue to forsake the lives of children for 20 or 30 years until I become a leading
            politician and earn the right to speak?&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But&hellip; You are still a parliament member, Ayanokoji-sensei. You are

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We are politicians and public servants, but it is a special job. People with

            That is why we need the help of the financial world. Please lend me your strength.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You want status and prestige. You want to earn money. That is why you save

            are a parliament member. If they know that this is the foundation of a higher aim for you, I think some of
            them may think that they will gain a great reward when you eventually become a big name.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Status, prestige, and money. These are indeed indispensable things, things

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, there is a big reason that I am interested in this project.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As things are now, Japan cannot compete against the world. However, it cannot
            catch up to the global world by only watching the education of human resources who can compete naturally.
            That is precisely why I want to encourage the thorough education of our children, and develop capable
            people, geniuses, who can compete against the world. That is what I think. This isn&rsquo;t just about
            saving lives. I want to transform those lives into ones of high value to the world, that is my true
            objective.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Compulsory life aid and education. This will be hard to accept for the world. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The education of children is left entirely up to their parents. So you thought
            that children whose parents are absent can be raised and educated for the sake of your ideals,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for my sake. It is for the sake of Japan&rsquo;s
            future.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11 c15">After the war, Japan had grown with the bubble economy, but now that it has
            disappeared, it is only falling down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We have to put an end to the current situation in which Japan is already being
            ridiculed as joining the group of developing nations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you think when you see that all the politicians are old people? Do you
            think that elders of 70, or 80 years of age truly think about Japan? They don&rsquo;t care what happens in
            the little time that they will live. They don&rsquo;t think about what will happen in 50 or 100 years at
            all, either. Even I, one day, may change to such a mistaken way of thinking. But, not now. Now, as a
            representative of the young people, I am thinking about the future, and I want to save it. That is why I
            must move to action as soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before I noticed, I was passionately talking to myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Was I seduced by this man&rsquo;s shrewd thinking, or did my instincts as a
            politician get riled up?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Naoe-sensei knows about all this, yes?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No. These are all my personal thoughts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t answer with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, as if he knew, Sakayanagi nodded once after looking at my eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mine and my father&rsquo;s philosophy of education, and that of yours seem to
            be very different. However, that does not mean that it is a bad thing. Rather, I believe it is one of the
            important approaches. It is also a case to judge which side is right. The situation is very similar to what
            I find myself in, near Naoe-sensei, right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man&rsquo;s father is in charge of the advanced nurturing high school.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is certainly one of the new ventures.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, as Sakayanagi says, that is largely different from my policy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will introduce you, as you wish. However, I will give you one
            condition.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What would that be?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When this project actually comes to fruition, please let me stand by you and
            watch over how you do it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that really all you want?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;For me, this is very important. I will be learning a lot.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I promise. Once the facility is actually built, you will be free to enter and
            leave as you wish.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a cheap price to pay if I can build a pipeline to the financial world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Besides, even I am curious about many things about the advanced nurturing high
            school.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I may also be able to find out some information about Naoe-sensei&rsquo;s rival
            Kijima-sensei.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whether friend or foe, information is power.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But, will things really go so easily?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man in front of me has been smiling from the start, and even as we exchange
            opposing opinions, he is showing me a friendly attitude.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is there not a possibility that there is something behind this?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just because Naoe-sensei recommended me to do this, there is no proof that he is not
            under the patronage of a different person.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c15">If what we are trying to do leaks out from this man&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11 c15">I was rushing to raise money, but perhaps I stepped too far in?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even though I have done research on this man beforehand, I did not have enough time
            to do as much as I wanted. It would be dangerous to accept him without questioning, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I must have the resolve to repeatedly deal with risks like this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If it is alright, I would like to have dinner with you soon. I would love to
            further inquire about your high school education.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was also hoping to hear about politics from you, in addition to this
            project. I would be happy to join you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Things like dinner invitations are merely a ritual to make a simple shallow
            relationship seem more proper.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Well then, let&rsquo;s go for round two, shall we?</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I woke up, I could see the dirty stains on the ceiling wiggling and
            shaking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think I drank too much after all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was in a daze, unable to put up the energy to get up, the bell rang three times
            at short intervals.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Perhaps noticing that the door was not locked, the visitor came in without
            hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa, with whom I have had no contact for two weeks, came to the office, out of
            breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-san! Wake up! I found it, I found the perfect place!&rdquo;</span>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Don&rsquo;t yell out loud.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Coupled with my lack of sleep, I felt as if I was being yelled at through
            loudspeakers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With my ears ringing, I had no choice but to sit up, and received Kamogawa&rsquo;s
            report.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You very much smell like alcohol. I&rsquo;m jealous, where did you eat
            something delicious?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Drinking alcohol is also my job, it is a series of hardships; I do not have
            the nerve to think of it as being fun.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he thinks that I&rsquo;ve been drinking cheap alcohol with some ladies, he is
            talking naively.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if you become a politician, you can&rsquo;t hold a self-important attitude, and
            have to repeatedly pour alcohol for those above you. It is no different from the daily lives of
            salarymen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The documents Kamogawa reported with great joy were the documents of the property
            that was to become the stage for our project.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Saitama, huh? It was your hometown, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is not really a surprise, as I thought Tokyo would be unrealistic with the high
            land prices.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. There was a pharmaceutical company factory deep in the mountains, but
            sales dropped after problems with pollution were reported a few decades ago, and the company went bankrupt
            some years back. The factory was not demolished, and it remains there to this day. The site was neither too
            large nor too small, so I thought it seemed like the perfect location for the project.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He put the documents on the desk and displayed the map on the computer to confirm its
            precise location.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am grateful that in this day and age, you are able to get the information you want
            in real time wherever you are.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is an ideal location more than an hour away from the nearest train with no buses
            in the area.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11 c15">The site also includes the prices for both renting and buying. They are a little
            expensive, but we can also make the choice of purchasing it after a long-term contract.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Well, depending on the negotiations,the period and price can vary.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;However, 2,4 million is a bit high, don&rsquo;t you think? There is a similar
            place 30 minutes from the station for 2.5 million. I think there may be more room for
            negotiation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think that they are also just testing us at first.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11 c15">This place is in a situation where it can&#39;t get a tenant so easily, so it
            won&#39;t be hard to convince the other party to be the ones asking us to rent it instead of us asking
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If it becomes a long-term contract, there is a possibility that the other side may
            agree to a suitable price reduction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You seem quite enthusiastic, but do you have a budget estimation for the
            remodelling?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He pulled out another document from under his arm and offered it to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that he at least has the ability to think things over.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He seems to have already accounted for all the items that would be considered
            necessary for the construction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, he&rsquo;s even made a 3D model.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is this yours too?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. I asked a friend of mine who works in the construction industry for help.
            Of course, I did not tell him anything about this project, so do not worry. How is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not bad. However, we definitely don&rsquo;t need any extra paint. I&rsquo;m
            not going to spend money on looks.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thorough budget cuts it is, then, yes?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We can worry about appearances after securing some money.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will re-adjust things in that direction.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The first step is to put the project on track.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, results will also be demanded of us.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You did well, for the time being. I&rsquo;d like to contact the owner of this
            place as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What about an intermediary? Will you send one there?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, since we already have an intermediary, playing clumsy tricks would have
            the opposite effect. Rather, it would be better to move them to our side.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11 c15">I do need to keep searching for a second, or third candidate, but I&#39;d like
            to resolve things in one try, if possible. The date of my party with the financial world through Sakayanagi
            is approaching.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Assuming all goes well, what about the children? Even if we have the money,
            the facility, and the educators, we cannot do anything without the children, can we?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, things are moving forwards on that point, too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I have my target set.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Target? Please tell me in concrete terms. I am your ally too.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As Kamogawa looked at me with expectations in his eyes, I glared at him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There are things in this world that you would be better off not knowing about.
            If you carelessly learn something you should not, I won&rsquo;t be able to help you if something happens to
            you. Let alone not being able to become a parliament member, are you prepared to spend years, or decades in
            a prison?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;N-no..! I don&rsquo;t, not at all..!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not a threat. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In truth, I&rsquo;ve started moving with a plan that would be over at the drop of a
            hat if it were to get out. I can&rsquo;t let Kamogawa get involved in this matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This isn&rsquo;t to protect Kamogawa, but me. If this guy were to be taken in by the
            police,</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It would be impossible to evade a vigorous inspection. Besides, I&rsquo;m sure he
            won&rsquo;t keep silent to them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Anyway, there are many ways to secure children, so don&rsquo;t
            worry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Normally, when a newborn baby is born to unidentified parents, it is sent to a
            nursery or an orphanage through the children&rsquo;s welfare center. From then on, foster parents are found
            for the baby and it is adopted.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no knowing if their life will be happy or not after that, but the same is
            true for those who are raised by their own parents. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The important thing is to &nbsp;provide a favourable environment. As long as a method
            to secure the baby is established, here is nothing wrong with a nurturing agency stepping in.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wish there was a simpler way to obtain children, one that I could tell you
            about, but it&rsquo;s difficult for now. If we moved with a frontal attack&hellip; Even if I am a
            politician, no one would hand over a child to someone they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that how it is?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, with a few words of warm protection, government favouritism, and some
            jarring nice words, a mother may be willing to give up her newborn.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I have to assume that such will not be the case.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is there not a way to take babies from an orphanage?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There are no orphanages in Japan. To be precise, they are foster homes.
            Further, in the case of newborn babies, which we are looking for, it will not be an orphanage, but a
            nursery. However, we cannot evade their suspicions either. Because it is a matter of life or
            death.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you live an average life, it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to be indifferent to this
            sort of thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure Kamogawa had his hands full coming up with a list of potential sites
            for the facility.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, we are going to check into nurseries. But that will only happen
            once the operation of the facility gets off the ground and it is decided that it&rsquo;s a government-led
            policy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the real mission will be to eventually set up and provide the children
            ourselves. We will either buy out the director of a gynaecology department, or, if that does not come to
            fruition, we will open a gynaecology clinic.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s not that hard to find a doctor who will sell his soul to the devil,
            so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I showed the concrete documents to Kamogawa on the computer and explained this to
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That we will inevitably create a place to act as a receptacle for mothers who are
            unable to raise their children. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is no reason for anyone to interfere with this.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The day a child is born from the mother&rsquo;s womb &nbsp;counts as day 0, and
            babies under 28 days old are called &ldquo;newborns&rdquo;, but, behind the doors, we will take in the
            newborns up to three month old babies. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The mothers will not be held responsible for their children, and, in exchange, sign
            an agreement to have nothing to do with their babies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, the babies will be raised under strict physical supervision until they reach
            six months of age, at which point they will be placed in the educational program.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re prepared to abandon a perfect education for the first few
            years?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish. We will give them a thorough education from the first
            year, whether there is money or not. You are naive if you think that half-baked results will move the
            political and financial worlds, Kamogawa.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They, too, are educating the children of their own flesh and blood to be gifted from
            an early age. If we are not able to show an overwhelming difference in ability compared to that, the
            credibility of this facility will be shaken.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We have to make them the best in both intelligence and physical ability.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The bigger the sample, the better it is. Whether it&rsquo;s 10 or 20 people,
            we&rsquo;ll take them in.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how many of them break, we can simply suppress the facts. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If there are 10 survivors, we&rsquo;ll simply pretend there were 10 from the
            beginning.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This will show how competent it is as an educational institution.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But how can you educate infants? They can&rsquo;t even understand
            words.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you know what baby signing is?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Baby signing? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As you say, infants can&rsquo;t speak. So, there are signs that were thought
            up to attempt communication with babies. Brain development and muscle growth are vital for learning and
            handling words, but, the development of hands or fingers are a lot quicker.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, acquisition of these baby signs will be difficult until they are around
            six months old.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that babies have a lot more intelligence than adults think
            they do. </span><span class="c11 c15">If you don&#39;t teach them, they can do nothing but cry</span><span
            class="c2">, but if you teach them baby signing then they can convey the reason why they are crying to
            adults. This project will go beyond that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The ultimate form of early learning. From the moment of birth, a thorough education
            will be imparted onto the child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is the goal of this project.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is also necessary to gather people who won&rsquo;t talk too much and think of a

            don&rsquo;t know what will actually happen yet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what happens&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Unable to endure the sleepiness assaulting me, I closed my eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I laid down to rest, reflecting on the difference between this place and the hard
            fabric of my office.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wonder how much time has passed since then.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Was it one minute, or one hour?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I unexpectedly opened my eyes and woke up, there was a face glancing at me from
            the side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Familiar large eyes and lips.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The same gaze that always looks at me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you wake up?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...How long did I sleep?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I got my body up from the sofa, I washed down a glass of whisky to wake myself
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;About 10 minutes, probably? You look really tired.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only 10 minutes. However, it feels like my body became just a little lighter in these
            10 minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you want some tea or water instead?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, drinking is much better for my body in times like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika nodded in dismay, then skillfully added more alcohol and wiped the water
            droplets from the glass.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have something to ask of you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that your first conversation topic after waking up? How about forgetting
            about work for a little?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I spontaneously put strength into the hand I was holding the glass with.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important work, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is no line between important or not important work. I can&rsquo;t miss
            even a single thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For me, even finding a chestnut in a fire is an important order.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Being a politician is hard, huh? I watch them on TV and see them dozing off in
            parliament, being accused of corruption, or being accused of philandering. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like
            there&rsquo;s many who do their jobs properly, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From an ordinary person&rsquo;s point of view, the world of politics is exactly like
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The ruling party and the opposition parties are seen as doing their job while
            shouting abuse at each other like children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for me. If the people above me worked properly, then there
            wouldn&rsquo;t be any gaps for me to enter through, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Thanks to the many old politicians acting as they please, I can aim for the few empty
            seats.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think that you can become a great politician, Atsuomi.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After saying so, she gently put her hand on my thigh.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You say that with a lot of confidence for a woman who knows nothing about
            politics.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika next to me came to Tokyo after graduating from middle school, and threw herself
            into the world of cabaret after going through a few jobs. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With her good looks and confident attitude, she quickly went up to being the number 2
            girl</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">in this bar.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I met her while looking for a place to entertain a member of parliament, and we
            deepened our relationship.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We even dated as lovers for a time, but that was a long time ago.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The reason that we did not break off our relationship then was not just because of
            the physical aspect, but because she is also talented with her work.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Mika knows how to use her weapons, and she has had close relationships with several
            men who are at the core of the ruling and opposition parties. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A young, beautiful woman who can only socialise as an adult without negatively
            affecting her family. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Politicians have a lot of secrets. The more secrets people keep, the more they want
            to tell.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Politicians are wary of smart women. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the other hand, they are less cautious about women who are not so smart.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If a woman responds with a knowing but not understanding &quot;huh&quot; when any
            secret is divulged, it will be easier to have pillow talks. Because you won&#39;t have to worry if you say
            too much, since the other party will not remember.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">But this Mika is different. She has no knowledge, but she has at least a minimum
            amount of wisdom.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She knew how to sniff out the money in politicians&#39; statements and record it in
            any way she could.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">And it all started when she demanded the number one position and money in exchange
            for cooperating with me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, it was with the hope of not only dragging down the number 1, but thoroughly
            crushing her. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In response to the easy to understand price, I drugged the woman who was number 1 at
            the time and eliminated her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now she is probably somewhere earning a pittance by keeping company to dirty
            customers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Since then, we have become more involved and have been maintaining a give and take
            with each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want to grasp some people&rsquo;s weaknesses.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I put the photos of the seven people I&rsquo;ve picked out from the financial world
            onto the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do any of these faces look familiar to you, or do you think they are people
            you can pull in?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. I don&rsquo;t think any of them have shown up over here,
            but&hellip; Ah, I think I saw this guy at one of our affiliate establishments&hellip; Wait a minute, let me
            check. What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sonezaki.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if to jog her memory, Mika called somewhere on her cell phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, hey, Sofia? There&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to ask, but do you know
            a customer called Sonezaki-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After a few moments of friendly chatter, Mika ended the call and nodded.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Bingo. There&rsquo;s a big customer who&rsquo;s really into Sofia, it was
            him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very convenient, then. Can you use him well?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What should I do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This Sonezaki is a married man with two daughters in middle school. It&rsquo;s
            only natural for him to play around with women after becoming wealthy, but he still wouldn&rsquo;t want his
            circumstances to be made known to his family.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This ended up being quite simple, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Try to come up with something for the remaining people, too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And one more thing. I want you to get close with Sasada too. It seems like his
            position has been going up lately. I want to learn one or two of his weaknesses in advance.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Sasada, right? Why?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Hearing Sasada&rsquo;s name, Mika did not hide her disgust.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I hate scummy bastards who touch my body without permission in plain sight
            though, you know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is he obsessed with you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He even says that he&rsquo;ll give me any amount of money I want if I spend a
            night with him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfect. Respond to his desire. He will give you more money than
            you think.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A weapon that men cannot possess. It&rsquo;s a simple and effective strategy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How much will I get?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll live up to your expectations if you show results.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I got it. I&rsquo;m not enthusiastic, but I&rsquo;ll do it well.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget to be with Naoe-sensei too. That person values you
            too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For the first time, Mika&rsquo;s expression shadowed a little.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That, how should I put it&hellip; no matter how many times I get in close
            contact with him, I can&rsquo;t ever see his true heart.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She took a hand towel, and folded it suitably.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is a habit Mika does a lot to distract herself from topics she doesn&rsquo;t
            like.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;From my point of view, he&rsquo;s an old man but he has an energy that makes
            you feel otherwise.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I never thought I could get you to say so much. As expected of
            Naoe-sensei&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is a person who shouldn&rsquo;t fool you by his aged appearance.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Be careful. I don&rsquo;t want you to get swallowed up.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wonder how many men you&rsquo;ve presented these words to.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I pulled a handful of bills from my wallet and messily put them on the table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you leaving already? I have some time, you know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, but I don&rsquo;t have the time to be so leisurely.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Alcohol and women are luxuries to indulge in, nothing more, and nothing less.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">All that stuff will come eventually.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s important now is to perfectly execute the project, and to make a name
            for myself in the Naoe Faction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c16 c14">4</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A few months later, in my office, I was looking at the finished photos of the
            building that had just finished construction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The floors, ceilings, walls, and everything else are painted with a white
            base.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The reason for this monochromatic colour scheme is to give the impression that the
            facility is clean.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Pure, innocent, clean, and holy; white has a number of strong positive
            connotations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Many government officials will eventually visit to inspect the education that will
            take place here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a little bit of an image strategy, but it is an element that should not be
            underestimated.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Good morning, Ayanokoji-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa had arrived early at the Saitama site with the engineer for the final checks
            and reviewed the facility with a board in hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The work seemed to have come to an end, and he came back to the office with a look of
            relief on his face.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All construction is complete.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well done. It looks like the facility was made exactly in the way I
            imagined.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, with that budget, how did you renovate it so beautifully? Normally, it
            would be no strange thing for it to cost almost twice as much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There are a lot of construction contractors where dust comes out when you
            knock on the door.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you whisper too good to be true stories along with threats in their ears, they
            will cooperate without regard to profit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is finally becoming a reality, huh? The human resource development
            project.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All of it, it&rsquo;s all because you were able to move the people in the
            financial world, Ayanokoji-san. You collected around 400 million in one night, that&rsquo;s a pretty big
            thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The 400 million was invested in the educators, the land, the buildings, and the
            construction of the facility itself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most of it is gone now, though.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had my life on the line to collect the money, but I won&rsquo;t have any trouble
            using it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;These people are fed up with money, but they are always hungry for honor and
            prestige. If this project succeeds, they will get that in return. From the look of the party, they must have
            a lot of deals like this going on behind the scenes.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They are probably investing in a number of projects at the same time, including mine,
            and only think of it as a profit if one of them succeeds. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Some of them may have even forgotten about my existence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you saying we&rsquo;re not special?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine to say so for now. Rather, it&rsquo;s more risky to get too
            much attention.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, what&rsquo;s ahead of us will also be crucial.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In addition to the teachers who will provide the education, the children who will
            receive it must also be secured.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But first, I have come up with a name for the facility that will be
            responsible for the human resource development project.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh, really? What did you name it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;White Room. To emphasize white, which gives an image or purity, and to push it
            forward.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;White Room&hellip; I see, it is simple but also easy to
            understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Anyone will be able to see, that as its name suggests, this place is the White
            Room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I hope we can get the teachers and many others to visit us soon.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa is becoming merry, but things will not go so easily. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kamogawa. I have something important to tell you. The world of politics is not
            a simple binary of friend or foe. If you go into it with an easy way of thinking, you&#39;ll end up in a
            mess you can&#39;t get back from.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He tilted his head back with a dumb look on his face, as if he didn&#39;t understand
            what I meant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I guess you weren&rsquo;t ready for that talk
            yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No matter how favourable it looks, I am still walking on a bridge that could collapse
            at any moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa doesn&#39;t know the fear of walking on that bridge yet.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What will you do after this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m supposed to meet and interview a few people here today. It&rsquo;s not
            possible to run White Room just by myself, so. It&rsquo;s scheduled for 4 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&#39;s impossible for amateurs to educate children out of the blue.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa looked at his watch and bowed his head, looking a little offended.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He must have thought he was in the way, since the interview time was about 10 minutes
            away at 4:00 p.m.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Come with me too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re also in charge of White Room, and you have a right to see who
            you&rsquo;re dealing with.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With a gleeful gleam in his eye, Kamogawa hurriedly began to clean up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Exactly when it was about a minute from 4 o&rsquo;clock, a visitor knocked at the
            office door.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya, a man appearing in a white coat, lightly bowed and approached.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hello there, Ayanokoji-san. I never thought that a stray researcher like me
            would be approached by a great politician like you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said I&rsquo;m hiring you yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man who showed up, Souya, was originally a doctor, but as a result of a number of
            problems he had caused, his medical licence was revoked. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After that, he began research on human growth. He was highly praised by some, but he
            has not been able to return to the limelight because of his past history.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kamogawa. If you have any first impressions about him, tell me.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is it&hellip; Alright?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa looked like he was not trying to interrupt, but I could easily tell he had
            things he wanted to say.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want to hear your opinion.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Umm, I&rsquo;m sorry, but why are you here in a white coat?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come here naked, can I?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&hellip; Normally, it&rsquo;s common sense to wear a
            suit for an interview, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya looked at his clothes, and nodded somewhat unconvincingly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t that a minor detail? My formal attire is a white coat, so I
            don&#39;t think there is any problem. I&#39;d rather you take me more seriously with this than with a suit
            and tie.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya replied so, without a trace of apology.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, Ayanokoji-san&hellip; what will we do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Are you going to hire a man like him? That&#39;s what his eyes were telling
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is true that he had a lot of problems with his attitude and the way he dressed,
            which could not be said to be appropriate for an interview.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, neither of these things were a necessity for the personnel that White Room
            needed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&#39;t have a medical license, but I&#39;m proud to say that my
            background is impressive.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about your personal history.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems that we need to cut away this misconception first.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, for the first time, Souya&#39;s nonchalant attitude hardened slightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Enough&hellip; You&rsquo;re here to judge me for what I did too, aren&rsquo;t
            you? I came here because you said you would interview me regardless of my past problems, but it turned out
            to be a mistake.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions by yourself. I told you that I don&rsquo;t
            care about the past. I&rsquo;m talking about your entire career path. What university you graduated from,
            what hospital you worked at, what kind of crime you&rsquo;ve committed. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have no interest in any of it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya, about to get up from his seat, stopped moving.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All I&#39;m looking for is your current thoughts and abilities. You have a
            good perspective as a person and insight into human beings. Are you confident that you can use your
            skills?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know most things when I see someone. That hasn&rsquo;t
            changed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">For the first time, Souya showed his face as a researcher.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It takes a lot of guts and determination to enter the illegal world.
            That&#39;s all I wanted to see here. I can&#39;t really judge whether or not you&rsquo;re actually useful
            until I see you in the field.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t have the luxury of picking and choosing someone with a personality I
            like.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...My apologies.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya bowed deeply, even though I didn&#39;t ask him to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The few years after I was discharged&hellip; I was always frustrated as I ate
            up my savings. I shut myself in and continued cutting myself off from the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You regretted it, didn&rsquo;t you? The past mistakes you&rsquo;ve
            committed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Regret? I do not regret anything. I just can&rsquo;t help but get mad thinking
            about why they sold me out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He doesn&rsquo;t in the least think that he did anything wrong.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So he was exactly of a nature that was bound to fail, and he did.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa, who had led a serious and mild-mannered life, must be a bad match for
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will give you a chance to come back to life. From now on, you will work for
            me as a former doctor and researcher, managing the subjects and helping them grow. Understand?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man with nowhere to go has nothing to complain about when I employ him with the
            same treatment as before.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much. I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;ll live up to your
            expectations.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I told him right there and then that I would be employing Souya, and left.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really worried about whether it&#39;s okay&hellip; to hire someone
            like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand what you want to say. However, this is actually more convenient
            for us.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is, is that so?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is no one around him who he is close with. Further, he is obsessed with
            money, and does not seek honour in the outside world. If we give him money and a place to work, I am sure he
            won&rsquo;t betray us. It is impossible to contact outsiders and generate a third party income
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, there is a possibility that he will threaten us and demand higher wages,
            but if that is the extent of his behaviour, there is no need for us to hesitate.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he also understood while dealing with me, that it would not be
            profitable to make an enemy of me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I, I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If that man is the only one coming in, we won&#39;t last much longer. Leaving
            aside this Souya, I gathered a lot of people who are talented but were fired after causing a lot of
            problems, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&#39;t be negligent in terms of leadership, but as far as their competency goes,
            they are dependable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In addition, we have other professionals from the field of training, including one
            who ran an obstetrics and gynaecology practice, an expert in ecology, and a mentor who has built up olympic
            athletes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, this is just the start. From here out, we will expand our reach and bring
            in geniuses in all kinds of fields to work on the children&rsquo;s development.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But, was it okay not to ask for more details? We don&rsquo;t really know how
            well he can work.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Detailed explanations are unnecessary. I don&rsquo;t know anything about
            medicine or education, anyhow. So, I&rsquo;m going to emphasize that they will have to work hard, and employ
            them based on the fighting power they can bring in.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So you&#39;re saying that&hellip; almost everyone who comes in for an
            interview has already been accepted?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. So it doesn&#39;t make any difference whether
            you are sitting next to me or not.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In the sense of putting pressure on them, I can see that it helps a little.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m not sure how much knowledge I can gain by studying now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&#39;s best to put the experts against the experts, rather than have a complete
            novice stick his neck out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The answer to the question of whether the guy can really do it or not, or
            whether the guy coming in for an interview is capable of it or not, can be found by letting the people you
            hire compete with each other.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A separate team of experts will analyze whether the education has produced results.
            If they don&#39;t see certain results, they will simply cut the head off without mercy.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The interviews began at 4:00 p.m. and ended at 8:00 p.m. after meeting with a total
            of six people.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I understand Kamogawa&#39;s feeling of weakness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have no doubt that all of them are professionals in their field. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, as human beings, they were all so immature and nauseating.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I knew that I should not think that I could have a decent conversation with
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It would be easy to hire all of the people gathered here today, but&hellip;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is a big problem in regards to their characters, but, I will hire
            Ishida, Souya, and then Tabuchi, who seem to have the most proper personality. As for the rest, their inner
            problems were stronger than their ability, so I intend to let them go for now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Leaving aside his statements, his history, and way of thinking were great,
            huh? I don&rsquo;t really understand that well, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, it remains unknown whether this will help the project get off the
            ground.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought that I might see things a bit better with the interviews,
            but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In no way can I shake off this feeling of uneasiness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even if they are competent, I didn&rsquo;t feel anything breaking through.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is it really possible to provide the best education like this?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go eat something.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I won&rsquo;t make any progress even if I think about it, so I should probably reset
            my head for now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right!? Let&rsquo;s go, it&rsquo;s just the time for it right
            now!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I invited Kamogawa out to dinner for a change of pace, and right after I got up from
            my seat while taking my cell phone out of my pocket&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji-san, did you drop something?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After saying so, he held out a piece of paper he picked up from the ground to me. It
            was a business card.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, he did give this to us, didn&rsquo;t he? It&rsquo;s all crumpled,
            but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It might be a good idea to see how useful he would be.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, are you going to contact him? His smile, it was kind of scary,
            but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a dubious title, but that Naoe-sensei would not put someone of no use besides
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It might be a good idea to just get in contact with him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I tried calling the number written on the business card on my cell phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I couldn&rsquo;t get a connection, I am willing to dismiss it as a lost
            opportunity.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s about how I felt.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After I put in the numbers and the call rang a few times...</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I thought you might be contacting me, Ayanokoji-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could tell from the voice also that it was Tsukishiro, and he answered without
            hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How did you know it was me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I never gave him my number, and this was the first time I had ever called
            Tsukishiro.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because it is only natural to investigate beforehand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The act of looking into my number itself did not surprise me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s just a matter of asking around Naoe-sensei, or his secretaries.What I
            don&rsquo;t like is the way he seemed to know that I was calling.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;What is Naoe-sensei making you do?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just a mere introduction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I sensed intuitively that there was a set-up behind the scenes</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand what you mean, but I can&rsquo;t give an answer
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re watching to see if I mess up, that&rsquo;s about it,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t sense the other party&rsquo;s agitation or true nature just by his
            voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, at the same time, that would also be a risky decision.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">At the very least, it is hard to believe that this Tsukishiro man would shop an
            opening so easily.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet you soon if it&rsquo;s alright. I may be able to meet
            your expectations as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I was thinking about what to do, the invite came from Tsuikishiro&rsquo;s
            side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Expectations?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You called me because you are in trouble, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are very confident, huh? I haven&rsquo;t said a word about it yet. You may
            regret it if you set your expectations too high.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready even now, if I am needed.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Now? He has quite some confidence, huh?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Or, he may have a different objective.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Do I stay on guard, or do I purposefully go along with him?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, it&rsquo;s now.. I won&rsquo;t let you say it&rsquo;s
            unreasonable, then.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course. What shall we do, then? I can visit you myself. You are in the
            office right now, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...Fuck you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Is he saying he even knows I live in my office?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It looks like things will go smoother if I am the one who goes out. Can I have
            around an hour, then?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Leaving aside if Tsukishiro had confidence that I would visit him or not, there is no
            mistaking the fact that he has been searching for my vicinity and that he has grasped it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems like information about this project is already flying around with
            Naoe-sensei at the center.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Umm, what happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting Tsukishiro now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What, now!? What about food..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Go alone. I&rsquo;ll meet the guy by myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as he has one foot in this project, Kamogawa is a trove of
            information.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as there is the possibility of this man being an enemy, Kamogawa&rsquo;s
            existence will be a nuisance.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c14">6</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One hour from then. I had been waiting outside the office to see how he would show
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, at pretty much the agreed upon time, a black BMW&rsquo;s figure came into
            view.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the parking lot, so please wait a bit.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro, opening the driver&rsquo;s side window and saying so, put his car into a
            parking lot and came back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to drive yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I work alone most of the time, so. Besides, I don&rsquo;t like leaving the
            driving to someone else. It is the same thing as having your life in their hands.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I thought the man was being exaggerated, but on the flip side, he may just be exposed
            to that much danger.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Moving on to the office, I sat Tsukishiro down at a suitable spot.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You said you may meet my expectations, but do you know what needs to be
            done?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He never broke his smile, which gave rise to an unpleasant atmosphere.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. It is related to the human resource development project,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Looks like Naoe-sensei sees through anything and everything. huh? I guess this
            means that he had no intention of leaving it all to me from the start.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That day, I thought that Naoe-sensei left the project to only me and Kamogawa.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, maybe it&rsquo;s my fault for interpreting it in that way. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">My first big job. I guess it is only natural that because he must succeed,
            Naoe-sensei would want to have things guaranteed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If I go down, you&rsquo;ll take over the project and be left with its
            management, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Maybe I will, or maybe I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, there&rsquo;s no way he would answer honestly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man&rsquo;s age shouldn&rsquo;t be that different from mine. It seems like
            he&rsquo;s stepped into a lot of places.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In that case, it would be normal to depend on him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m wrong, I think. He must simply be looking out in advance for the
            politician who will be my replacement.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If Kamogawa and I fail, a different politician will take over the project.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Impressive. That&rsquo;s a half-correct answer, Ayanokoji-san.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Half, is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. There are two duties left to me; one is exactly what you spoke of. The
            other one is to aid the politician who is in charge of the human development project.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aid?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A strong support. However, you don&rsquo;t seem to be pleased,
            huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It sounds good when you say &ldquo;aid&rdquo;, but a process for the case of me
            failing must also be included.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make sense of it. I don&rsquo;t think Naoe-sensei would rely on
            you, who is around the same age as me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is true that, just like you, I am young if you look at it from the world of
            politics. However, if you are good at supporting the big name politicians, you will be valued even if you
            are young. Well, in my case, I work with any partner, regardless of if they are a politician or
            not.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro, not even trying to hide the fact that he is successful.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t think it is overconfidence. He&rsquo;s showing me confidence based on
            his achievements.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Before asking you to work, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to confirm
            beforehand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What would that be?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I pulled out the newspaper from this morning, and put my finger on an article in the
            corner.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ooarai City in Ibaraki Prefecture. It looks like there was a body at the port
            there.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that rare of a story, is it? Many people are dying all over
            Japan, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He was a local journalist, I know this man. He was a lone wolf who hated the
            world of politics&hellip; mainly the ruling party, Citizens Party.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What about it? Does it have anything to do with now and this
            place?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you do it, Tsukishiro?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You ask very direct questions, huh, Ayanokoji-san? Do you think I will answer
            with a yes?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. What I want to know is whether or not this reporter
            was keeping a watch on Naoe-sensei when he met you at the restaurant the other day or not.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Without even moving a brow, Tsukishiro lightly dropped his eyes onto the newspaper
            article.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He seemed like he was about to write a gossip article about Naoe-sensei, you
            see. That he&rsquo;s playing around with young women even though he has a wife and children. The Citizens
            Party couldn&rsquo;t have avoided its image being damaged.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I expected. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the reason that this man was moving together with Naoe-sensei in the
            restaurant the other day. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He put a woman on Naoe-sensei on purpose, determined the reporter who would be aiming
            for this, and took care of him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, I&rsquo;m sure he will not admit it in daylight, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I made a fist, and strongly hit the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That does not seem to be fear, huh? Goodness gracious&hellip; Could it
            actually be, anger?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro continued while curiously analyzing my movements.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is true that with this talk, shaking in fear or fright would be the normal
            thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because it is possible that the man before my eyes has killed a man as a job.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wondering why you weren&rsquo;t left with the work
            yourself&hellip; Is that the source of this anger?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dirty work is my role. It&rsquo;s been like that up until now
            too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I get even one order, I am confident that I can deal with it just as well as this
            man.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;At the least, I won&rsquo;t be so stupid that the body will end up
            found.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know your circle of friends very well. You are very close with the Ooba
            Group, aren&rsquo;t you, Ayanokoji-san?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Does he naturally have a grasp on everything about me?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then you should have already understood very quickly that I would not be
            afraid of you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The Ooba Group is not a large organization, but they are quite notorious. I am
            aware that you worked very hard to build up a friendly relationship. However, if the corpse is not found,
            then it is not a corpse. A missing person could not have put fear into the hearts of the numberless enemy
            rats watching Naoe-sensei, could it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In other words, he did not fail to hide it, but purposefully let the body be found,
            huh..?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whether or not Tsukishiro is involved in the death of a local reporter is no longer
            relevant.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t think this is a guy I can threaten by reaching out with my arms and
            grabbing him by the chest here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I am being made to think so, then his strategy is working well.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand how you feel, but that is proof that Naoe-sensei is putting his
            heart and soul into his human resource development plan. Since he decided to select you, he couldn&rsquo;t
            let you cross a dangerous bridge just to sink a reporter. Even if this incident becomes a problem, the
            person who would be blamed for it would be someone else, someone you don&rsquo;t know anything
            about.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This man is dangerous. However, his talent is high, and he is a quick talker if he
            knows what&rsquo;s going on.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he could not manoeuvre over the people he faces, he could not have reached these
            heights.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There are a lot of things about it I don&rsquo;t like, but you can&rsquo;t
            make an omelet without breaking eggs.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is correct. We should keep our personal circumstances separate and think
            things through, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Any more idle chatter is just a waste of time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I should try to get into the main subject.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been interviewing staff for a new research facility. I&rsquo;ve
            managed to secure some personnel, but I&rsquo;m still lacking a deciding factor. I will need time to search
            again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re asking if I can help you with arranging human resources? That
            was fast.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you have any ideas. I&rsquo;m not looking for a half-hearted asset,
            though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do not worry. I know of a person of talent who would convince you,
            Ayanokoji-san.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;However, it is a different story if I will introduce them to you. You
            understand, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This world is mostly about business. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It doesn&#39;t matter if you like your partner or hate them, or if you have a deep or
            thin relationship with them..</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand. How much?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I can get a reward of equal value, I have no dissatisfaction about paying
            money.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In theory it is best to handle things with cash, but I have some policies of
            my own. I would like to sit down and talk with potential clients. First of all, would you be willing to
            allow me to interview you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. I was the one interviewing just a few minutes ago and now
            I&rsquo;m on the receiving end.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What a joke. However, it would be foolish to throw away an opportunity for the sake
            of a little time and pride.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright. You can do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m going to play along with Tsukishiro&#39;s game here and see if I can use him
            or not.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro took out a light blue clear file and pulled out several sheets of paper
            from it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">So, was it &nbsp;all calculated to get us to this point?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ayanokoji Atsuomi, 31 years old. Male. Born in Kumamoto Prefecture, Aso City.
            Education history is high school-&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait a minute. Is it necessary to confirm that stuff with an
            interview?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is important.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He may not be joking, but his thin smile makes me want to vomit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You and I are equals. No, maybe not even equal. What determines our hierarchy
            is up to you now, and you can decide. If you feel like swearing, please do not refrain from putting it into
            words.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He is smiling, but I wonder how serious he is. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However,I have already made my decision.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Because I&rsquo;ve come to understand that he seems so different, yet so similar in
            character.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have not been refraining from anything, but I still had to restrain myself
            with Naoe-sensei behind me. From now on, I will deal with you without reservation in the true sense of the
            word.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That would be best.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">After grinning, Tsukishiro began to speak again.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;ve followed your career as far as I can. Your life has not been easy,
            and it seems that you had a poor childhood.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;m not sure how much research he&#39;s done, but it seems he&#39;s done his fair
            share. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seems likely that he is in contact with someone who knew me as a child and as a
            student.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also investigated your family structure. It seems your parents
            abandoned you when you were little, and you were raised by your grandparents from your father&rsquo;s
            side.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">From the way he speaks, it would seem that a bad lie would have the opposite
            effect.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No parents, no money, no proper house. That&rsquo;s how my life
            was.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No proper house? What kind of place did you live in?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A shack for farm equipment maintained by the adults in the neighbourhood. It
            had a crude tin roof and no electricity or gas. I could only take a bath once or twice a week with hot water
            boiled in a cassette stove.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&#39;s not a past to be proud of; in fact, to others it would sound like
            self-torture. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I&#39;m not pessimistic about the past.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I think it has allowed me to lead a life that has given me the determination to rise
            to the top.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My grandfather died when I was in junior high school. But, it was a turning
            point. I was able to buy an old house nearby with my grandmother with the money from an insurance policy he
            had put out before he died and moved.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It wasn&#39;t the kind of house you&#39;d want to live in. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, I remember that I was happy because I felt like I had a big castle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is your grandmother alive?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No. I remember that she died when I was over 18 years old.
            Probably.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to care that much.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see her die, and I have no interest in it. I was too busy
            living my life for myself, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I did not attend the funeral, although I received one phone call from someone who
            seemed to be a distant relative. I paid only the minimum expenses and let them handle everything.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Including my grandfather, I don&#39;t even know where their graves are and where
            their remains are buried. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see that after all the hard work she put into raising you, her life ended in
            vain.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know if it was hard work or not.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, I know that raising a child is hard work, and I think so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But it is true that it was an empty end. The son she had raised with all her
            heart and soul abandoned his child and disappeared, and the grandchildren who were left behind did not even
            try to help the parent who raised them. She had to live in poverty for decades and never had the luxury of
            living a good life.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If I had lived as my grandmother, I would have described it as a living hell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How do you feel about that situation, looking at it objectively now? Does it
            hurt?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No? Nothing has changed from that time. No, it&rsquo;s more than that. My
            grandmother lived a life of a loser and died as a loser. If she had at least abandoned me, her grandson, and
            made good use of my grandfather&rsquo;s insurance money, she would have had a somewhat better
            life.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have no intention of living such a miserable life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can say that she was useful to me as a close antagonist.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When was it that you decided to become a politician?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It all started when I was a host and a woman who came as a client told me a
            story. She told me that being a politician is not only about money, but also about power.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In fact, there were many parliament members in the area who played around in
            cabarets. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was jealous of these people who played around with the public&#39;s blood money.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You ran for the first time at the age of 25, but your vote count was hopeless
            and you lost badly, also forfeiting your deposit money.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro read out the profile he had investigated of me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;At the age of 27, you announced your intention to run again when the House of
            Representatives was dissolved, and was first elected after being favoured and encouraged by Naoe-sensei. It
            seems you learned a lot about politics during those two years.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I admit that I was the most desperate man in my life. As a former host, I used
            women to get close to Naoe-sensei. Of course, that alone would not have won me his approval, but I am proud
            to say that he bought my persistent touch, my enthusiasm, and my ambition.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tsukishiro nodded his head in satisfaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you for the details.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Closing the file, Tsukishiro turned to face me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It should be fine. I will accept you as a client.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saying this, Tsukishiro pulled out a new file.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait a minute. You&rsquo;re accepting me as a client with this kind of
            talk?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You may lack some knowledge, but that is not important. You can make up for it
            plenty with your rich intellect and body.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s important is your &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;. Your ambition painted with
            unhidable evil, I&rsquo;ve judged that you excel in the qualities of a politician.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked down at the file in front of me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They are excellent personnel that will live up to your
            expectations.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Did he even foresee that I would contact him looking for personnel?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">No, there is a possibility that Naoe-sensei is backing him up from behind the
            scenes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not this time. It is best if I can be repaid in a big way one day in the
            future, so. You may become a big-name one day. That is the biggest reason that I decided to accept
            this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me laugh. How many politicians have you whispered the same
            things to? Do you think that I will accept such flattery?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even this man who is babbling that he has accepted my talents only decided to
            cooperate with me after seeing my background.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not just one or two people,
            right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He admitted easily and stood up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you surpass others in talent, you will increase your enemies in the
            political world. Your stakes will be driven down, and your political life will be snatched away. Your evil
            and ambition may be held down by a stronger force.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be so easily crushed, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That may be so. If you find yourself in a place where you are about to be
            killed, you have to have the resolve to take the person next to you along with you. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That kind of person tenaciously survives.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Being a newcomer to the world of politics, I can&rsquo;t do anything without
            Naoe-sensei shielding my back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I left the office with Tsukishiro, a young man in white clothes came up to
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He is the one you are looking for. I had instructed him in advance to come at
            this time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Was this your intent from the start?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, I had no intention of letting you meet with him if you were
            unsuccessful in my interview.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Interview time for another newly added person.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">On his resume, a slightly rare name was written: &ldquo;Suzukake Tanji&rdquo;.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please sit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Even though the personnel were arranged by Tsukishiro and Naoe-sensei&#39;s side, I
            still can&#39;t let my guard down.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The person to be hired must be questioned in detail and checked for any
            problems.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man called Suzukake who entered the room looked like a middle-aged man with a
            stubble beard, but he was even younger than me: 29 years old. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He had graduated from the University of Tokyo at the head of his class and went over
            to the U.S., but he never made any significant achievements.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">He was a man without any titles except his intelligence, so to speak, but I still
            don&rsquo;t know why the Tsukishiro Side recommended such a man.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your r&eacute;sum&eacute; seems pretty blank, but what did you do
            abroad?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo; I was doing what I wanted to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...What did you want to do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, all kinds of things.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really understand that. Please speak concretely.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Human observation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve been seeing so many people today who can&rsquo;t even use
            proper honorifics.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s somewhat better to be spoken to normally than
            half-heartedly in honorifics.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then, please tell me why you decided to take this interview.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I heard it pays well. I need money to stay abroad.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The cost of living can&rsquo;t even be compared to Japan, so I can
            understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If one has the ability they should work on location, but judging from this
            man&rsquo;s attitude, I don&rsquo;t need to question him about the difficulty of doing so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have a question for you too, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Before that, please stop with that disgusting formal speech. You can look at
            me like I am insect all you want, but if you really want to work, then I want to know your true
            character.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;...I see. That&rsquo;s fine, but won&#39;t that just mean you&#39;ll have to
            leave?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If this is what he wants, I don&rsquo;t have to wear human skin either.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I broke my slightly upright posture, and crossed my legs.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t hired at the moment, Suzukake. You graduated from a
            prestigious school at the top of your class, and you deserve credit for your brains, but you haven&rsquo;t
            left anything behind.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because I just wasn&rsquo;t even provided the stage to do so.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Replying so, he continued his words right after.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for fame or a title. But, I do want to understand the
            mechanisms of a human. This project&rsquo;s policy of human resource development seemed like the perfect
            opportunity to solve my questions.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not looking for a title, huh? If you perform to my expectations,
            you will be provided rewards you haven&rsquo;t been able to gain at the front stage.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I handed him the materials regarding the White Room, Suzukake immediately began
            to look through them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to dangle a large amount of carrots in front of these guys and make them show
            their talent without regret.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what I thought, but researchers are hard to understand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">With a childlike gleam in his eyes, he checked out the facilities and environment,
            and began to randomly murmur about his hopes and ideals.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.44sinio"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c16 c14">7</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Later, I visited the White Room in Saitama, which had undergone renovation work, and
            was exploring the image of the room and worrying about the selection of further educators. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, Kamogawa came to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&quot;Thank you for your hard work, Ayanokoji-san. Have you made arrangements
            for the children?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The plan couldn&rsquo;t start if I hadn&rsquo;t. The scheme is almost
            complete.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wow, of course&hellip; Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to give me the details.
            I don&rsquo;t want to, umm, get caught or anything yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A means to gather children, which I am not speaking of to this Kamogawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That is, to get newborns illegally from black market brokers using the Ooba
            Group.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, this entails many dangers. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As such, we must eventually switch to a more legitimate way of collecting
            children.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Although it is still in the planning stage, we will soon launch a website and
            announce that we will be a place for parents who cannot raise their unborn children due to unavoidable
            circumstances to be able to take their children to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ideally, we would cooperate with the parents even before the birth of the child. Some
            women can&rsquo;t even pay for a birth without relying on the government&rsquo;s system. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are many cases of women giving birth in secret and their children dying. Of
            course, this is theoretically possible. However, at the same time, there are great risks involved. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">A woman is not a parent in the true sense of the word yet just by carrying a child in
            her belly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">She may not be able to give birth, </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">or she may have no choice but to become a mother when she comes face to face with her
            child one day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">And what if there is a fatal accident? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If they sue for the return of their child, it will be traced back to the White Room
            in the backscene. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">That must be avoided.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If it becomes public, it would be more than just a matter of tarnishing
            Naoe-sensei&#39;s name.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is imperative that we only accept children from those who have given birth
            elsewhere, are not responsible, and cannot be mothers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It would be good to have a myriad of beautiful and hypocritical words on the
            homepage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&#39;t take a life,&quot; &quot;anonymous baby adoption,&quot;
            &quot;counseling for the needy,&quot; &quot;foster care system,&quot; and so on, all of which seem to
            guarantee a future for you and your child.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whenever a mother visits a hospital, the first step is always to set up a meeting.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We don&#39;t ask her name or where she lives, we just ask her to give a reason why
            she can&#39;t raise her child freely. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If the child is simply unacceptable, some will readily allow the child to go to
            foster care. If they are strapped for cash, we can just give them some money. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If they have no choice but to give the child to the hospital, we will be sure to
            provide an extension of one week. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Some parents may regret giving up their children the following day.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In this way, unrecognized children will be gathered and sent to the White Room.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">In order to be prepared for the possibility of being asked to return their children
            two or three years later, a connection will be made only with each mother in the form of a name.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Of course, you can&#39;t just return a child from foster care, that kind of reasoning
            doesn&#39;t work.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As long as we are doing something illegal, we need to avoid being publicized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Further, the commodity called children must be treated very delicately.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The problem is, if anything, beyond that. It is the medical care of the
            children brought to White Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Medical care..?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Children are weak. They get sick at the slightest thing. However, as it would
            be difficult to take them to a hospital, it is essential to have doctors who can treat them in White
            Room.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Not just any doctor, however.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There are many conditions&hellip; They must have had their physician&rsquo;s license
            taken away. Their thinking must be flexible. The doctor must be as old as possible, but not too old.
            Further, they must be able to re-acquire their physician&rsquo;s license if the situation demands it. They
            must also need money and be unwilling to work in the real world.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; Quite a lot of difficult conditions, huh? Should I say
            it&rsquo;s not beautiful, or&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right in thinking that. However, all over Japan, in every nook
            and cranny of the land, you will find those with unexpected histories if you search for them. In my search,
            I came across a former doctor who lives deep in the mountains of Tottori. He had a history of a traffic
            accident that killed two university students who were riding a bike in the past.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Accidents are not rare. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">While returning home after a late night at the office, the doctor was assaulted by a
            feeling of sleepiness and started to make a right turn without realizing the distance between himself and
            the bike coming straight ahead, and they collided. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">They could not be saved even after the police and an ambulance were immediately
            dispatched. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, the person he hit was a child of a well-known local landowner,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">and after that, he fled to an unrelated region to run away from the people&rsquo;s
            eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;10 years since that accident. It was possible to get his physician&rsquo;s
            license back, but, he&rsquo;s been living his days drowning in alcohol.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That, that kind of person is&hellip; But, while it is good news that you found
            him, aren&rsquo;t you worried?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He was always a flamboyant and extravagant person. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
            aiming for.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">One person, at the very least. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Another one if possible.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have to secure doctors to be in charge of the children&rsquo;s health.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c1" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c9">Part </span><span class="c21 c16 c14">8</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">3 months after that. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The arrangement of the children is progressing, and the operation is finally about to
            begin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the final phase of the project, the educational part, has to be finalized
            with the educators.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I brought what little luggage I had into the white room and was about to gather the
            live-in researchers into the lab for a discussion.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida, Souya, Suzukake, Tabuchi. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The four of them are sitting down wearing their white robes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;From now on, you four will be in charge of training the first batch of White
            Room students. This is the first time we meet in person, but we&rsquo;ve had many discussions in online
            meetings. I don&rsquo;t think there will be any obstacles to working together.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please wait a bit. We did have many discussions, but we have not yet reached a
            consensus in the direction we are heading or our policies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">How do you intend to align us together?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Souya, the elder, strongly expressed his mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida and Suzukake were not even nodding, but instead were confident that they were
            not mistaken in their own principles. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">This was the same in the repeated online meetings too, so it&rsquo;s no
            surprise.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I could endlessly let them continue discussing the direction they want to take, but
            they would never get along.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What if I tell you to twist your opinions and obey me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that. In that case, I&rsquo;ll get out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Me too. I&rsquo;m here to provide my ideal education. If I can&rsquo;t do
            that, I don&rsquo;t feel like being here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The same goes for Suzukake. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The idea of compromising was never even in the corner of his mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is with the rude attitude towards Ayanokoji-san? I know you&rsquo;ve been
            paid a fitting amount of money at the preparation stage.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kamogawa, an amateur in the field of educational theory, could not overlook the fact
            that they were being disrespectful. However, I rebuked Kamogawa.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying troubling things, but there&rsquo;s no need to jump to
            conclusions.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The children we&rsquo;ve prepared and can use right now are 15 in total.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I lined up 15 sheets of business-card sized paper with the babies&rsquo; names,
            genders, and dates of birth written on the backs.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then, I shuffled them as if randomly mixing cards, and put them on top of the
            table.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ishida, Suzukake, Souya. Pick 5 random cards each and take them. They are the
            kids you will educate and be in charge of. Educate them for a certain period of time. The first term White
            Room students will be trained in three groups at the same time. Tabuchi has agreed to supervise you all
            equally.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tabuchi nodded, and sent a glance towards the three.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. Good idea. As long as our views don&rsquo;t align, this is the only
            choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The conclusion I came up with was to let these three compete freely. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It would be an impossible task to ask these geniuses, who have different philosophies
            and beliefs, to align themselves from the start.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s not going to last forever. The training period is three
            years. When all the children reach the age of three, they will be given a comprehensive test, and the one
            who led the group with the best performance will be the official leader.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">There was no cause for concern, as no one thought they would lose.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida nodded, satisfied with the content, and reached for the paper, so I glared at
            him and grabbed his arm.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;W-what!?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Listen. If you lose and then say something stupid like that your children have
            different qualities or that you are not going to abide by the decision, you will lose the three years&#39;
            worth of money you have inscribed in your bank book as a penalty. And you will completely lose your position
            in the underworld, and not just in the public eye. Make sure you don&rsquo;t forget that,
            alright?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida in front of me took in my words and strongly, slowly, took a gulp.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You two are fine with it too, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No objections.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seemed that Souya was convinced too, but I&rsquo;m sure he is more certain
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, Suzukake was the only one with a stern expression.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you have any complaints, talk now.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;m just stuck on the follow the leader part. I
            don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll lose, but I want to know how the people by my side will move. Am I supposed to
            follow a leader of different principles with blind acceptance? If so, I have no intention of taking this
            on.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If all I want is a yes, I don&rsquo;t need a genius. There is no merit in
            uniting three people, much less three different people like you. The leader has the final say, and if there
            are any objections to the policy, I&rsquo;ll ask for a thorough discussion. That&rsquo;s also why Tabuchi is
            here, so.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the ruling party and the opposition party, huh?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">As if impressed, Kamogawa spoke like a politician.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;... I understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ishida has also calmed down, but still has not lost color in his confident
            eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It will delay the plan, but for now this is probably the best option.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The first term students will be trained in three groups over a period of three years,
            and after that, a leader will be chosen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It will cost money and reduce efficiency, but it is a necessary step to bring these
            educators together.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I will create a new educational policy and start training new term students on a
            yearly basis.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure I will be forced to modify various plans along the way, but this is
            the best option I can take now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
