    <p>The Sports Festival has ended and the first Cultural Festival of the Advanced Nurturing High School is soon approaching. Hasebe and Miyake have put up a wall with the class, and while there are unhelpful students like Kōenji, Ayanokōji and his other classmates' preparations for the Maid Café were progressing steadily even in secret. However, there was no way that Ryūen was oblivious to this and he suddenly destroyed the cooperation agreement with Horikita's Class.

    <p>There was a man. Atsuomi Ayanokōji, aged 31. A politician.</p>

    <p>That is———his uncontrollable, ever-expanding "ambition".</p>
    
    <p>Atsuomi had been doing dirty work for Jinnosuke Naoe, the head of the Naoe faction that he was a part of. As a chance to reward all the hard work that he had done, Naoe offers him a top-secret project:</p>
    
    <p>The founding of an institution for a 'Talented Persons Nurturing Program', which is under the direct control of the government——.</p>

    December, after the end of the School Trip. The final Special Test
    of the second semester, the Cooperative Written Test is announced.

  <p>
    In this test, everyone takes turns at answering the questions of the
    test, with the class as a whole answering a hundred questions.
    Horikita's Class B will face Sakayanagi's Class A.
  </p>

  <p>
    While they are preparing for the test, Nagumo announces that he will
    decide on the next Student Council President. The student council
    members from the second year are Horikita and Ichinose. Even though
    people were asking her to run for it, Ichinose's own desire was to
    quit the student council altogether.
  </p>

  <p>
    And separate from the problem of finding members for the new student
    council, with Kiryūin targeted by a bogus shoplifting scandal, even
    the people around the Student Council find themselves busier and
    busier.
